        "body": "He urged the leaders to be more constructive in their criticism of those in elective positions.\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu has called on religious leaders to refrain from vilifying or denigrating the nation in their sermons.\n\nSpeaking during Ramadan Iftar with traditional rulers and religious leaders at the State House on Thursday in Abuja, the President emphasized the important role of religious leaders in shaping public opinion and fostering a sense of unity among citizens.\n\nHe urged the leaders to be more constructive in their criticism of those in elective positions.\n\nPresident Tinubu also declared that his administration is determined to turn Nigeria's challenges into prosperity.\n\nHe reiterated that no terrorist can defeat the collective will of Nigerians, no matter how hard they try to prey on innocent citizens.\n\nHe urged traditional and religious leaders to forge a strong bond with the government to defeat terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, and other forms of criminality in the country.\n\n\"Yesterday in Abuja, I attended the burial of the 17 soldiers killed in action at Okuama, Delta State. I saw their pregnant wives and little kids.\n\n\"The love of the nation is in your hands. Pray for our country. Educate our children. The sermons we preach to the members of our churches and mosques are important.\n\n\"Do not condemn your own nation. As a Yoruba man and as our fathers will say, 'No matter how slippery the bottom of your child is, you must leave the beads there.'\n\n\"Leave the beads there. This is your country; do not condemn it in sermons, do not abuse the nation. Leadership is meant for change.\n\n\"Yes, this leader is bad, fine. Wait until the next election to change him, but do not condemn your country. Do not curse Nigeria. This is a beautiful land.\n\nThe President, who acknowledged the birthday wishes and goodwill extended to him on the occasion, reminded the leaders that his birthday on March 29, 2024, coincided with Good Friday.\n\n\"I have earned the honour of having my birthday fall on Good Friday, and I pray that on this Maundy Thursday, you all shall return to your homes safely. May God guide and keep you and your families in good health, and lift your spirits,\" the President prayed.\n\nDifferent speakers at the dinner expressed gratitude for the opportunity to come together in the spirit of Ramadan to share a meal with the President and renew the bonds of friendship that unite the nation.\n\nVice-President Kashim Shettima emphasized the pivotal roles of religious and traditional rulers in promoting peace and unity, urging them to continue to ''build bridges that transcend ethnic and religious divides.''\n\nThe Vice-President expressed delight that the nation's economy is on a rebound, noting the strengthening of the naira against the dollar.\n\n\"The President means well for the nation, and he has continued to redefine the meaning and concept of modern leadership.\n\n\"For many years, fuel subsidy was an albatross. The President took a bold decision from day one, and he hit the ground running. Now the economy is turning the corner,\" the Vice-President said.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Traditional Rulers Council of Nigeria, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, assured the President of the unwavering support of traditional rulers and commended the government's efforts to address the hike in food prices and the security challenges.\n\n\"You are not alone, Mr. President. The prices of food items and goods are gradually coming down. You are doing your best on security, and we cannot allow you to do it alone. We will join hands to support your vision for the betterment of our nation,\" the Ooni said.\n\nAmbassador Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli, Emir of Zazzau, speaking on behalf of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), highlighted the significance of Ramadan as a period of reflection, empathy, and unity.\n\nOn the security situation in the country, the Emir of Zazzau, who represented the Sultan of Sokoto and President General of NSCIA, expressed optimism that the country will return to peace and stability.\n\n\"I am happy to see representatives of Muslim and Christian communities in this room. I pray God Almighty blesses the President for him to do more to take the country to the Promised Land,\" the Emir prayed.\n\nApostle Samson Fatokun, General Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), noted that the Ramadan dinner with religious and traditional leaders, coincided with Maundy Thursday, the Thursday before Easter, observed in commemoration of Jesus Christ's institution of the Eucharist during the Last Supper.\n\nThe General Secretary, who delivered the address of CAN President, Archbishop Daniel Okoh, commended President Tinubu for fostering a harmonious relationship between the State and the Church.\n\n\"We are encouraged that your administration has shown great determination in tackling the challenges of kidnapping and banditry and bringing to justice the perpetrators of this dastardly act.\n\n\"We shall continue to show our support to your administration so that you can execute your noble intention for the nation,\" CAN General Secretary said.",

        "body": "RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) -- Students at St. Augustine's University are getting ready to pack up and move out. The university is shifting to remote classes the rest of the semester, as it faces a financial mess.\n\nThis is especially hard for seniors ending their college career online, but the St. Aug's community is standing behind their school.\n\n\"When I came around freshman year, pretty much our first and second semester was strictly virtual,\" senior Miles Montgomery said.\n\nMontgomery started at St. Aug's in 2020, and he's ending his St. Aug's career the same way he started, going to class online.\n\n\"I'm a senior. I want to graduate, get out of here. So I was like, I don't want to have to go through this my last year, you know what I mean?\" he said.\n\nThe university announced in mid-March that classes would switch to virtual after Easter.\n\n\"Me, I'm more like a visual learner or so I feel like I do better in person with my teacher versus me having to log in on a laptop every day and join a link,\" Montgomery said.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of problems for St. Aug's. The school owes the federal government nearly $8 million, and it is fighting to keep its accreditation after the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges voted to remove it in February.\n\n\"I want my diploma to still mean something,\" Montgomery said. \"I've been here for four years. I want to feel like I did my job.\"\n\nHowever, some alumni are confident the school will get through this.\n\n\"We are not going to close. So get your outfits ready, and I'll see you for homecoming. Falcon pride!\" said Class of '76 alum Mary Ragland Thomas.\n\nThomas said the last few months have been hard.\n\n\"It depresses me to know that we have come to this point. No doing of ours, but the doing of the people that we thought we trusted,\" she said.\n\nThomas and fellow alumni are donating money to help out, but she said she needs school leaders to fix the problem.\n\n\"You need to do right because you're messing with young lives and alumni and the people that love St. Aug and trusted in St. Aug,\" Thomas said. \"And I'm looking forward to coming back for homecoming in October. Life cannot be without St. Aug's homecoming.\"\n\nShe said it is not just about today's students, but the future too.\n\n\"I got people in my family that I want to come here, great nieces and nephews. It's no better place because here they know you by name, and not by number,\" she said.\n\nThomas is not the only alum calling for the school to fix its problems. In mid-March, a group of organizations sent out a four-page resolution calling for nearly all Board of Trustee members to resign.\n\nMeanwhile, interim president Dr. Marcus Burgess continues to reassure the community, the school remains accredited while they work through arbitration.\n\nThe shift to virtual learning does not affect graduation. Seniors are allowed to remain on campus for the rest of the semester, and graduation will continue as planned, in-person on May 4.\n\nMontgomery also said the school has told seniors their degrees will be valid, despite the fight over accreditation.",

        "title": "Gonzaga men throwing changeup against Edey, Purdue with bigger lineup in Sweet 16",
        "body": "DETROIT -- The Gonzaga men's basketball team has experienced lots of growth since its last run-in with Zach Edey and Purdue four months ago at the Maui Invitational.\n\nFour inches and 38 pounds, to be exact.\n\nThat's the height-weight discrepancy between freshman wing Dusty Stromer and junior forward Ben Gregg, the players who traded spots in Gonzaga's starting lineup in mid-January.\n\nThe change Gonzaga made midway through January is the most discernible difference between the team that faced Purdue in a first-round Maui Invitational matchup four days before Thanksgiving and the squad that will take the floor against the Boilermakers two days before Easter this Friday in the Sweet 16.\n\n\"It's a different look, for sure\" Edey said Friday at Little Caesars Arena. \"They kind of just play only two guards and play them the whole game, kind of cycle in those bigs, present some challenges on the glass. But we think we can present some challenges right back at them.\"\n\nGonzaga's \"three-big\" alignment has presented issues for just about every team the Bulldogs encountered since debuting the unit during a Jan. 18 game against Pepperdine.\n\nIts efficacy will face another huge test against the 7-foot-4 Edey, the runaway favorite to repeat as the national player of the year, and a Boilermakers team that possesses size across the board.\n\nPurdue deploys a starting five that also includes 6-foot-9 Trey Kaufman-Renn, and the Boilermakers can bring 6-foot-10 Caleb Furst, 6-foot-7 Camden Heide and 6-foot-7 Ethan Morton off the bench.\n\n\"I think rebounds are a huge part of this game, and they're going to be physical; they've got big guys, including Edey, and even their bench,\" said Gonzaga forward Anton Watson. \"They've got a lot of tall guys, so rebounds are going to be huge for us, defense, and I feel like since Ben got in the lineup, it's gotten a lot better.\"\n\nGonzaga's conceded the rebounding battle on seven occasions this season, including four times with the bigger lineup, but after compiling a 12-5 record with the original starting unit, the Bulldogs have gone 16-2 since -- losing twice to a Saint Mary's team that ranked 23rd nationally in team rebounding and knows the Bulldogs better than anybody else in the country.\n\nPurdue's becoming intimately familiar with Gonzaga, too, after last year's meeting in the Phil Knight Legacy in Portland, Ore., and November's matchup in Honolulu.\n\nBut the Boilermakers are anticipating a different challenge from the Bulldogs in round two this season.\n\n\"Obviously, it does what you think it would, it gives you much more rebounding, just bigger guys in iso situations,\" Kaufman-Renn said of Gonzaga's new lineup. \"It's just harder to guard because they're much bigger.\"\n\nThe Zags are better equipped to keep up with Purdue on the glass after losing that battle 46-31 last season in Portland. Gregg hauled down six rebounds off the bench to help Gonzaga match the Boilermakers in the rebounding column -- both teams had 38 boards -- in November.\n\nMost teams have to sacrifice floor-spacing when they swap out a guard for a forward, but Gregg's been one of GU's most efficient perimeter shooters, making 38% of his three-point attempts this season while going 4 for 6 in the NCAA tournament.\n\n\"With Gregg, Watson and Ike all starting, obviously Watson and Ike not as much, but Gregg can really spread the floor for them real well,\" Furst said. \"So I think it's about knowing our matchups defensively, scheming in ways that put us in the most opportunistic ways and offensively taking advantage of those mismatches with having to have some of those bigger guys against our guards.\"\n\nThe area Gonzaga hopes its bigger lineup will help the most? Containing Edey, who averages 24.5 points and 12.1 rebounds. He posted a 25-point, 14-rebound double-double against the Bulldogs in November.",

Freighter pilot called for tugboat help before plowing into Baltimore bridge The pilot of the cargo freighter that knocked down a highway bridge into Baltimore Harbor had radioed for tugboat help and reported a power loss minutes earlier, federal safety officials said on Wednesday, citing audio from the ship's \"black box\" data recorder.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current world news briefs.\n\nCaught up in concert shooting, a Russian woman said goodbye to the world\n\nRussian artist Alyona Kazinskaya likes to fill her social media feed with cheerful messages and vivid floral paintings. For 30 minutes last Friday night, it turned into a timeline of terror. Kazinskaya and a friend had bought last-minute tickets to see Soviet-era rock group \"Picnic\" perform in front of 6,200 people at a concert hall near Moscow. They thought about taking their daughters but decided to go by themselves.\n\nZelenskiy tells US House speaker: Quick passage of military aid is vital\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday that it was vital for Congress to pass a new military aid package for Kyiv rapidly in order to maintain international unity on the conflict with Russia. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has held up a bill for months that would supply $60 billion in military and financial aid for Ukraine.\n\nIsraeli soldiers play with Gaza women's underwear in online posts\n\nIsraeli soldiers have been posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the war in Gaza as a looming famine intensifies world scrutiny of Israel's offensive.\n\nIn one video, an Israeli soldier sits in an armchair in a room in Gaza grinning, with a gun in one hand and dangling white satin underwear from the other over the open mouth of a comrade lying on a sofa.\n\nWorld Court orders Israel to halt Gaza famine; Hamas says ceasefire needed\n\nThe World Court on Thursday unanimously ordered Israel, accused by South Africa of genocide in Gaza, to take all necessary and effective action to ensure basic food supplies to the enclave's Palestinian population and halt spreading famine. But Gaza's Hamas rulers said a ceasefire was needed to halt the humanitarian crisis.\n\nNetanyahu asks Israeli court to defer deadline on conscription controversy\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday asked Israel's top court to defer a March 31 deadline for the government to come up with a new military conscription plan that would address mainstream anger at exemptions granted to ultra-Orthodox Jews. The decades-old controversy has become especially sensitive as Israel's armed forces, made up mostly of teenaged conscripts and older civilians mobilised for reserve duty, wage a nearly six-month-old war in Gaza to try to eliminate the Islamist Hamas movement that rules the Palestinian enclave.\n\nFreighter pilot called for tugboat help before plowing into Baltimore bridge\n\nThe pilot of the cargo freighter that knocked down a highway bridge into Baltimore Harbor had radioed for tugboat help and reported a power loss minutes earlier, federal safety officials said on Wednesday, citing audio from the ship's \"black box\" data recorder. The head of the National Transportation Safety Board also said that Francis Scott Key Bridge, a traffic artery over the harbor built in 1976, lacked structural engineering redundancies common to newer spans, making it more vulnerable to a catastrophic collapse.\n\nSouth Africa bus crash kills 45 Easter pilgrims, Transport Ministry says\n\nA bus crash in South Africa's northern province of Limpopo resulted in 45 deaths and one serious injury, South Africa's Department of Transport said on Thursday. The driver lost control and collided with barriers on a bridge near Mamatlakala, causing the bus to go over the bridge and hit the ground, catching fire, according to a statement by the transport department.\n\nRussia links concert shooting to 'Ukrainian nationalists'; US says 'nonsense'\n\nRussian investigators said on Thursday they had found proof that gunmen who killed more than 140 people at a concert last week were linked to \"Ukrainian nationalists\", an assertion immediately dismissed by the United States as baseless propaganda. Russia has said from the outset that it believes Ukraine was linked to the attack, even though Kyiv has denied it and the militant group Islamic State has claimed responsibility.\n\nUS urges UN Security Council action to get aid into Sudan from Chad\n\nThe United States warned on Thursday that it would push the U.N. Security Council to take action to get aid to starving people in Sudan, possibly by authorizing cross-border deliveries from Chad, if the Sudanese armed forces do not restore full access. Ahead of the one year anniversary of the conflict in Sudan, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the warring parties had both undermined aid operations and ignored a Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities.\n\nDozens of stalled Israeli visas seen hindering Gaza aid efforts\n\nDifficulties getting Israeli permission for foreign staff to work in Israel and the Palestinian territories are hampering efforts to get aid into war-shattered Gaza where civilians are facing imminent famine, according to U.N. data and aid workers. Six aid workers from the U.N. and other groups interviewed by Reuters cited delays to visas as an example of red tape they say is thwarting aid to Gaza, nearly six months into Israel's offensive against Hamas militants.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "body": "If you're in the market for a pop-of-color suitcase that will set your luggage apart from all the other black cases at baggage claim, look no further than the just-launched luggage collection from Delsey Paris. Made in collaboration with Italian sportswear brand, Benetton, the three-piece collection is an explosion of springy color, with cases in Easter egg pastels like Robin's egg blue, grassy green, and peony pink, in addition to camellia red, and classic black with a distinctive preppy green Benetton stripe.\n\nLaunched just in time for spring travels, the collab is the latest from innovative French brand Delsey Paris, which has been making luggage since 1946. (In fact, the brand was the first ever to create luggage with a durable rigid shell. And in 1972, they launched the first luggage on wheels, using a telescoping handle with retractable wheels.)\n\nBenetton, of course, is the Italian sportswear brand that made an indelible impression on the world in the 1980s with its vibrantly colored fashions, and distinctive and memorable ads that championed diversity and inclusivity through eye-catching campaigns like \"All the Colors of the World,\" with a wider range of multicultural models than was common at the time.\n\nThe new collection of spinners in three different sizes (carry-on, medium, and large) offers travelers features like scratch-resistant twill finishes, TSA-approved locks, 360\u00b0 spinner wheels, and adjustable telescoping top handles as well as handles on the tops and sides. The spacious, fully-lined interior keeps clothing, shoes, toiletries, and more organized with tie-down straps, a zippered divider, and a mesh pocket.",

        "body": "Humanitarian charity Tearfund is calling on the Minister of Workplace Relations to get the ball rolling again on modern slavery legislation.\n\nUnder the previous Labour government, plans were made to introduce new laws that would require organisations with over $20 million in annual revenue to publicly report on what they were doing to address the risk of exploitation in their operations and supply chains.\n\nThe changes were slated to be made by the end of 2023 - but after Labour were ousted in October, the plan stalled, and new Minister of Workplace Relations, ACT's Brooke van Velden, hasn't committed to taking it any further.\n\nTearfund spokesperson Sharon Walls says the new Government needs to get it moving again.\n\n\"We are wanting to ... encourage people to remind the Government that this is something Kiwis want, and they want to know about what's in our stuff and in the things that we're purchasing,\" she told Newstalk ZB on Good Friday.\n\n\"[Kiwis can] send a message to the Minister of Workplace Relations, Brooke Van Velden, and say, 'hey, what's happened to our legislation here? We need to do something about it.' Kiwis want to know.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Tearfund released its Chocolate Scorecard, which it hopes will help Kiwis make more ethical choices about the chocolate they consume this Easter.\n\nNew Zealand chocolatier Whittaker's ranked sixth in the world, with competitor Mondelez, owner of Cadbury, coming in 25th. Mars Wrigley, maker of M&Ms, came in fifth and boutique chocolate brand Tony's Chocolonely topped the rankings.\n\nWalls says the scorecard aims to expose some of the dodgy activity in chocolate companies' supply chains.\n\n\"We know that Kiwis really care about what they're purchasing and having some transparency around it. New Zealand does lag a little bit behind other OECD countries - Australia, the UK, the US - in measuring lead, and it's the same with the chocolate and the cocoa that is being purchased.\n\n\"These other countries actually have scrutiny on a legislative level about what's happening in the cocoa supply chain. Tearfund is really concerned about the pointy end of our chocolate, about who's picking it.\n\n\"Primarily it comes from West Africa, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. And there are kids who are working in the cocoa plantations instead of going to school; they're working in the supply chain so that we can purchase chocolate. So we're really motivated to expose some of that and help Kiwis make wise choices about the chocolate they're purchasing.\"\n\nWalls says consumers in Aotearoa have far more influence on chocolate manufacturers than they might think.\n\n\"Sometimes we think, 'We're a little country on the end of the world - what can we contribute?' But New Zealanders are the biggest consumers of chocolate in the world, 4.8kg each per year.",

        "title": "How Latin American Muslims observe Ramadan amid sadness and",
        "body": "SAO PAULO: Throughout Latin America, Muslim communities are observing Ramadan this year without the atmosphere of festivity that is common during the iftar meal owing to the suffering in Gaza, where more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on Oct. 7.\n\n\"This will be one of the worst Ramadan celebrations for us,\" said Bashar Shakerat, a community leader in an area on the border between Uruguay and Brazil called Little Palestine due to the relatively high concentration of Palestinian immigrants.\n\n\"We're praying at the mosque and there's no festivity later. Everybody is sad.\"\n\nOn Sundays during Ramadan, women traditionally cook large meals and people gather at the social club to celebrate. On weeknights, groups usually gather at home for iftar. Shakerat said nothing like that is happening this year.\n\n\"We just want to pray and stay quiet at home,\" he told Arab News. \"We just want this war to be over. We're tired. We want peace.\"\n\nBorn in the Palestinian city of Jenin, Shakerat said he has family in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as do many of the residents of Little Palestine.\n\n\"We traditionally collect food kits and distribute them among needy families in our city. We know that our brothers and sisters in Palestine are also starving,\" he added.\n\nMuslim communities in Latin America do not have a high number of Palestinians. Even so, the feeling of closeness to Gazans is omnipresent.\n\n\"Our mosque was founded decades ago by Palestinian immigrants. They moved to other cities or died over the years, and now most of our community are Africans or Brazilians,\" Turkish-born Sheikh Adil Pechliye, spiritual leader of Palestine Mosque in the Brazilian city of Criciuma, told Arab News.\n\nDespite the demographic change in the community, the mosque's members still have a deep connection to Palestine, said Pechliye, who graduated in Madinah in 2001.\n\n\"We've joined Criciuma's pro-Palestine committee, and have been active in protests and marches against the genocide in Gaza,\" he added.\n\nPechliye has been giving lectures on Palestine, and gave a Friday sermon in a public square a few weeks ago in order to disseminate information on Gaza.\n\nA couple of months ago, the Muslim community promoted a relief campaign and sent aid to the Palestinian enclave.\n\nPechliye believes that most Brazilians support the Palestinians despite the pro-Israel stance of the Brazilian press.\n\nHe praised President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has been fiercely critical of Israel and even compared what is happening in Gaza to the Holocaust.\n\n\"The Holocaust was undeniably terrible, but I don't think Lula tried to downplay its seriousness. He wanted to emphasize the horror of what's happening now,\" Pechliye said.\n\nIn the city of Santa Ana in El Salvador, the Muslim community also gathers to pray at a mosque named Palestine.\n\nMezquita Palestina Tierra Santa was founded in 2011 by a community that is almost completely made up of converted Salvadorans.\n\n\"We wished to honor Armando Bukele, who introduced Islam to El Salvador and whose family came from Palestine,\" Sheikh Guillermo Sanchez told Arab News.\n\nBukele was born in El Salvador to Christian parents from Palestine, but he converted to Islam and was an imam for several years. His son Nayib is the current president of El Salvador.\n\nSanchez said his community \"has strong ties with Palestine, and has been struggling to support Gazans in every way possible. A few weeks ago, we promoted a campaign to collect donations and sent it to Gaza.\"\n\nIn the Colombian city of Cali, the Muslim community is in constant sorrow for the Palestinians, said Egyptian-born Sheikh Amr Nabil.\n\n\"At night we'll have something to eat with our brothers here, but Gazans won't have anything,\" he told Arab News. \"That's very painful, and at the same time it helps us understand the injustices of our world.\"\n\nSince the beginning of Ramadan, the community in Cali has been praying for the Palestinians, and leaders such as Nabil have been giving lectures about Palestine and the roots of the conflict.\n\n\"I believe that only somebody who is completely uninformed about the Palestinian struggle is capable of supporting the ongoing genocide, or it's a person who has completely lost humanity,\" he said.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has criticized on several occasions Israel's attacks on Gaza. Many Muslims in the South American nation support his stance.\n\n\"His declarations are those of a human being who expressed solidarity to a people that's being massacred. We appreciate it very much,\" Nabil said.\n\nSheikh Abu Yahya, a Mexican-born community leader who converted to Islam 12 years ago, told Arab News this is \"the most difficult Ramadan. Our community in (the city of) Leon is formed by Mexican converts and by Muslims from Arab countries. We're all equally sad.\"\n\nHe said the community has been focusing on \"developing empathy and suffering together with those who are suffering, so prayers for the Palestinians have been constant.\"\n\nAbu Yahya added: \"We decided to take part in the local pro-Palestinian committee. We've been taking part in several activities and sharing information about Palestine.\"\n\nHe said amid pro-Israel campaigns in the Mexican media, many Mexicans do not have adequate information about what is happening in Gaza.\n\n\"That's noticeable during our lectures, but when people discover the reality, they express their solidarity with the Palestinians,\" he added.\n\nMany Latin Americans have been receiving information and images of the victims in Gaza via social media, which has been impacting the perceptions of a growing number of people in the region.\n\n\"The war doesn't spare anyone, and hunger is undoubtedly the worst way of dying. That's why it's impossible not to think about Gazans during Ramadan,\" said Shakerat.",

        "title": "Knowledge or religion economy: Nigeria versus the world - The Nation Newspaper",
        "body": "In today's world economy, the contradiction between the knowledge economy and the religion economy presents a compelling narrative that determines every nation's development. While some countries' development relies on their innovation, scientific advancement, and investment in education skills, Nigeria seems stuck in a cycle of dependency on religious fervour, neglecting the human intellect and creativity they are blessed with.\n\nNations practicing the knowledge economy are nations that have harnessed the power of human intellect, innovation, and education to drive economic growth and prosperity. They are trained to ask questions, research, and proffer solutions regardless of the situation. Japan, a true example, stands as a proof to the transformative potential of the knowledge economy. Even with its lack of substantial natural resources, Japan leveraged its skills in technology, research, and development to emerge as one of the world's most prosperous nations, with zero tolerance for religious extremists.\n\nIn contrast to Nigeria's reliance on divine intervention, Japan's success is based on critical thinking, problem-solving, scientific research, and continuous learning. Japanese society has always prioritized education, investing heavily in research institutions, and promoting a conducive environment for technological innovation and development. This has not only helped Japan sustain its economy but also influenced its global markets with its rapid advancements in automotive, electronics, and robotics industries.\n\nOn the opposite, the religion economy shows a cycle of dependency on divine intervention while neglecting the promising potential of human intellect and ingenuity. Nigeria, often cited as one of the world's examples, grapples with systemic issues stemming from her over-reliance on religious faith to address socio-economic challenges, coveting the development of other countries while asking \"God When?\" without taking any steps towards emulating the development process.\n\nDespite being blessed with abundant natural resources, over 60 years after independence, Nigeria lags behind in overall development, plagued by corruption, poverty, and infrastructural decay, and still categorized as a developing country. The continuous collapse of industries and the rise in the number of religious institutions in Nigeria proves the influence of the religion economy, where leaders and citizens await divine interventions for intellectual solutions. The reliance of Nigerians on faith-based solutions not only deters progress but also increases the socio-economic disparities, degrading Nigeria to the level of the \"poverty capital of the world.\"\n\nUsing Israel and Saudi Arabia as case studies proves the notion that religious affiliation prevents economic prosperity. Despite their religious significance as the birthplaces of Christianity and Islam, respectively, both nations embraced the knowledge economy, leveraging innovation, and strategic investments to bolster their economies. Israel is renowned for its development of technology and defence, signifying the cordial relationship between knowledge and economic development. Through investments in research and development, Israel has emerged as a global leader in cybersecurity, agriculture, and medical technology, promoting economic growth and technological innovation. Similarly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have made significant strides in diversifying their economies beyond oil dependence; they prioritize investments in education, infrastructure, and technological innovation. The UAE, in particular, is currently known as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship, catalysing economic growth through initiatives such as Dubai's Knowledge Village and Abu Dhabi's Masdar City.\n\nRead Also: Tinubu appoints Usman Bello as new CCB Chairman\n\nIn contradiction to the successes of Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, Nigeria's adherence to the religion economy has enabled a cycle of underdevelopment and stagnation. Despite its vast potential, rather than development, Nigeria continues to grapple with several minor issues ranging from corruption and unemployment to inadequate infrastructure and healthcare- all man-made issues that can be solved with human intellects and research if well-funded. Yet citizens await divine intervention for solutions.\n\nRather than provide funding for development, Nigerian leaders continue to allocate substantial resources for religious tourism and religious infrastructure. In 2022, A state governor spent N24 billion on erecting a worship centre in the oil rich Niger/Delta region when the people have no access to pipe borne water. Same year, another state governor subsidized Hajj pilgrimages for citizens to the tune of N20billion. These further buttressed the point of Nigerian leaders' misplaced priorities. This money could have been invested in education, research, innovation, and sustainable development. Rather, Nigeria squanders resources on religious issues that offer fleeting solace but do little to address the root causes of poverty and underdevelopment.\n\nThe comparison of the knowledge economy and the religion economy serves as a wakeup call for Nigeria to reassess their economic priorities and embrace knowledge and innovation, the path to development and growth. While religious faith and spirituality hold huge value for the citizens and should not be ignored, they must not overshadow the nations' investment in human capital, education, and technological advancement.\n\nNigeria, blessed with millions of intellectuals who are sought after all around the globe, should harness its abundant resources and human potential to advance herself towards prosperity and national development. Embracing the knowledge economy by prioritizing investments in education, research, and infrastructure, Nigeria can transcend the bondage of the religion economy and fully embrace her title as the 'Giant of Africa'.\n\n*Adeleye sent this piece from London, United Kingdom.",

        "title": "Subsidizing the Rich, Senator Ali Ndume, and Hajj Fare Palaver -By Abdulkadir Salaudeen - Opinion Nigeria",
        "body": "While every Muslim has the right to dispense their money and prioritize their needs as they wish, I think this is the time to help cushion the effect of this killing hunger especially as fellow Muslims struggle to fast in this blessed month. I believe many of my family and friend members (and even neighbours) will not forgive me if they learnt that I paid millions of naira for hajj from my pocket while they are struggling to rescue their enfeebled souls from the jaws of death due to hunger.\n\nI don't understand. Who is Senator Ali Ndume referring to? Few days ago, the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) made an upward review of hajj fees. The rationale behind the increment, according NAHCON's spokesperson -- the right honourable gentlewoman Fatima Sanda Usara -- was due to the fluctuating nature of exchange rates. She explains that \"In the event of change in the dollar's value at the time of final remittance into the Commission's IBAN account, pilgrims will either receive a refund or the balance will be reconciled accordingly at the appropriate time.\"\n\nThis clarification is clearer than the word \"clarity\" itself. Accordingly, pilgrims would have to cough out nearly N2m in addition to the initially fixed rate. What is unclear, however, is the allegation by the distinguished senator that there was a deliberate plan to deny Muslims the opportunity to partake in the exercise. Who are those scheming against Muslims? Immediately Ndume made this allegation, I quickly checked to confirm what I know. My check confirms that the political leadership of this country still carries the insignia of the Muslim-Muslim. Neither President Tinubu nor his vice has renounced Islam publicly -- they are still Muslims.\n\nI further found out and confirmed that NAHCON Chairman, Jalal Ahmad Arabi, and its spokesperson who made the clarification referred to above are practicing Muslims. So who is working against Muslims in Muslim-Muslim regime? Perhaps only Ndume knows. Ndume did not mention any name but he called on President Tinubu to approve payment of the extra cost as subsidy. Though meticulously selective, and in fairness to Ndume, he did not advocate for blanket subsidy. He emphasized that subsidy should be considerably given only to first timers -- those who are making it for the first time to Makkah as pilgrims.\n\nNdume is not alone. The would-be-pilgrims are also lamenting the hike. I have listened to some Muslim clerics who also complained about the sudden increment in hajj fees. Their complaints are all understandable. What I find problematic is their demand for hajj subsidy. While that demand sounds fair and reasonable to those making it, it sounds too ridiculous to hungry Nigerians. Government should subsidize hajj!? What is hajj in the first place?\n\nHajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is not just one of the five pillars, it is the least prioritized in the sense that a Muslim's Muslimness may not be affected -- in anyway -- by not performing it. The point is: the Lord of the worlds who instructs us (Muslims) to perform hajj conditions His instruction that the intending pilgrims should have the means to embark on the once-in-a-lifetime spiritual journey. If you do not have the means, you are exempted. If you are exempted, like my humble self, heaven will not fall.\n\nIn other words, if some Muslims in Nigeria could not make the spiritual journey this year to Makkah due to the sudden hike in hajj fare, nothing untoward will happen to them, to Islam, to any Muslim, or even to Nigeria. In fact the world will not feel their absence in the Holy House -- Kaaba. I have tried hard to convince myself on the need for hajj subsidy. It does not make any sense -- given the overwhelmingly existential hunger that is driving thousands of Nigerians to their graves.\n\nTo make his point sounds logical and sentimentalize the necessity for hajj subsidy, a Muslim cleric urged President Tinubu government to do the \"needful\" to ensure that they (Muslims) enjoy the Muslim-Muslim ticket they supported. I thought the Muslim-Muslim ticket was supported with the hope that it will sanitise the country, bring about economic progress, and overall development such that people would be well-to-do enough to perform hajj from their pockets with ease.\n\nJustifying hajj subsidy, the cleric claimed this is not the first time that government would intervene to beat down cost of making hajj. Former presidents, Obasanjo and Jonathan, who are not Muslims aided pilgrims -- by means of subsidy -- during their time. This is subsidizing the rich with the sweat of the poor(taxpayers). This is least expected from Muslim clerics -- turning logic on its head. I make bold to say that this is against the spirit of Islam. And it should be against the Muslim-Muslim leadership if we assume there is truly a tinge of Muslimness/Islam in it. In Islam, the rich give the poor; not the reverse.\n\nWhile every Muslim has the right to dispense their money and prioritize their needs as they wish, I think this is the time to help cushion the effect of this killing hunger especially as fellow Muslims struggle to fast in this blessed month. I believe many of my family and friend members (and even neighbours) will not forgive me if they learnt that I paid millions of naira for hajj from my pocket while they are struggling to rescue their enfeebled souls from the jaws of death due to hunger. Anyway, hardship is relative; so is poverty.\n\nNorthern governors were even called upon to help people perform this year's hajj. This is sickening. Our rulers should understand that the electorate voted them into power to create jobs and provide basic necessities. None of them, as far as I know, campaigned with the promise to subsidize hajj. This is not the time for politics, rulers should face governance. We can not teach God His religion; He teaches us. We cannot acquire knowledge of religion from Him only to later know more than Him. He says and I emphasize, \"And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka'bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one's conveyance, provision and residence).\" (Q3:97).\n\nAnyone who cannot afford it because the fare has been jerked up by N2m(or thereabout) should patiently wait till they are rich enough to make it. If you are not rich to perform pilgrimage, stop deceiving yourself. Wait for your time. Subsidy is not for you. I learnt Rivers State Governor, His Excellency Siminalayi Fubara, paid up for his state's Muslim intending pilgrims. What! Is he being generous? I am personally not impressed. It is a political gesture. How can you promote a cause you don't believe in? The responsibility of those we elected is to govern us; it is not to subsidize hajj. It is to help stamp out poverty in our midst through job creation, economic empowerment, and prioritization of our wellbeing.\n\nThree years ago, Governor Bala Muhammad of Bauchi State was even more wasteful than Fubara. Unlike Fubara who subsidized pilgrimage fare for Muslims, Muhammad sponsored Christian pilgrims in his state -- he paid it all. In an article titled \"On Bauchi State's Sponsored Christian Pilgrims: When Shall Common Sense Prevail?\" I asked: \"How do you justify wasting public funds on spiritual rites that are personal -- that do not benefit the State? What is our problem in this country? Why are we bereft of good ideas that can sprout progress and development? Why are we so infested with regressing ideas such as wasting public money by sending pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, Jerusalem, and (now) Jordan? Who did this to us? When shall we get it right in this country? Why are our policies always anti masses?\" After three years, nothing has changed.\n\nRather than acting unsolicitedly in God's name by subsidizing hajj, government should do something about the volatility and valuelessness of naira vis-a-vis dollar. God does not ask any government to subsidize hajj. What God wants from the government is to be just, kind, trustworthy, considerate, sympathetic and nice. On this, the government stubbornly and serially disobeys God.\n\nDear Senator Ndume, please get it right. Hajj cannot be justifiably subsidized in this context. I also believe our clerics -- who want subsidy for the rich when the poor are serially stampeded to their graves in quest for palliatives(peanuts) -- will get it right one day. Ebin Pa Wa O!",

Their focus has been more on the need for respectful treatment of Islamic symbols rather than leveraging the issue for political gain.\n\n\"Bersatu, especially through Armada, has been somewhat vocal. They have expressed concerns about the investigation's delay and aligned with calls for respecting Islamic values, but they too have avoided turning the issue into a political tool,\" Anis said, referring to the Youth wing of Bersatu.\n\nMeanwhile, International Islamic University Malaysia's (IIUM) political analyst Syaza Syukri felt that PAS has been very careful to not affect the unity fabric of Malaysia, which would help with its political positioning.\n\nShe pointed out that while PAS and Bersatu have already garnered substantial support from the Malay voter base and do not really have to stir the hornet's nest, Umno is still struggling to establish its relevance and consolidate its standing within the community.\n\n\"Umno Youth might think they are winning the narrative but PAS' more muted and balanced response might even be a smarter move, because PAS would appear as the party serious to win over a larger constituency.\n\n\"I think two things are going on. They are letting Umno take the blame for any deteriorating relationship with non-Malays. Secondly, I think because they really don't need to. They have majority Malay voters already,\" Syaza said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Selangor PAS chief Datuk Ab Halim Tamuri even urged for calm in the country, after a firebombing attempt at a KK Mart outlet in Perak became the latest development in the \"Allah\" socks controversy.\n\nThe Islamist party leader said that while the socks incident was significant to the Muslim community, it should not be allowed to jeopardise Malaysia's multiracial harmony.\n\nThis incident came even as Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim told the public not to be a prosecutor or judge over the issue of the sale of socks, saying the country would not be able to see any growth if the people decided to harp on certain issues, especially on the so-called \"3R\": race, religion and royalty.\n\nEarlier this week, the founder and group executive chairman of the KK Group that owns the KK Mart convenience store chain, and his wife, were charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court over the sale of socks with the word \"Allah\" printed on them at one of KK Mart's outlets in Selangor.\n\nDatuk Seri Chai Kee Kan, also known as KK Chai, and his wife Datin Seri Loh Siew Mui, who is a director of the company, pleaded not guilty under Section 298 of the Penal Code for deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of others.\n\nKK Mart has also filed a lawsuit against socks supplier Xin Jian Chang Sdn Bhd and its director Soh Chin Huat for supplying the controversial socks, seeking a court declaration that the supplier had unlawfully interfered with its business, and for court orders for Xin Jian Chang and its director to indemnify it for the losses and to prevent further causing of losses by unlawful interference to business.",

I normally try not to react, but since it concerns our religion, I felt compelled to intervene as a keen adherent and student of Islam.\"\n\nAnsari stated, \"May I tell Omar Abdullah that only the Almighty Allah will decide who goes to Jannat. That is the essence of our faith, of our religion. Let's not mock religion. Omar Abdullah will not decide who will go to Jannat and who won't.\"\n\n\"I have to caution him that the era of (Astagfirullah) 'la-ila-ha Illah sheikh Mohammed Abdullah' is over and so is the era of myths that Sheikh Abduallah's name was written on chinar leaves. That deception is simply not possible now,\" Ansari added.\n\nHe further said, \"And Mr. Omar Abdullah, look within. You are fortunate to have such generous political rivals. They refrain from questioning your religiosity. Elsewhere questions would have been raised. Your audacity, when someone could question you on numerous matters, is surprising. If you ask me, your actions qualify for departure from Islam. We have never touched your personal life.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Stop behaving like a feudal. Stop convincing yourself that after the Maharaja it was your family's turn.\"\n\nAnsari advised the NC leader to refrain from commenting on religious matters. \"And please don't refer to religion.

        "body": "Mohideen says many Melbourne Muslims have family and friends in Palestine.\n\n\"We hold the Palestinian people with so much love,\" Mohideen says. \"Every day I pray for peace. For this war to end. For people and children to be safe and for Palestine to be free from oppression.\"\n\nThere is a saying in Islam, \"to kill one person, you kill all of humanity, but to save a life is to save all mankind\".\n\n\"What I love most about our religion is compassion for everything living,\" Mohideen says. \"It is one of the most important principles of Islam. Life is most precious. It is God's gift.\"\n\nThe word Islam means \"surrender\". There are more than 1.8 billion Muslims in the world, and for them, the prophet Muhammad is the most revered of all men.\n\nMuslims belong to many different sects including Sunni and Shiite, but they all share fundamental beliefs known as the five pillars of Islam.\n\nFasting from sunrise to sunset, or sawm, in Ramadan is one of these core pillars. The holy month ends with Eid al-Fitr, a holiday dedicated to feasting with family and friends.\n\nOther pillars of Islam include the verbal testament of faith; salat, the five daily prayers; and zakat, or charitable giving.\n\nMuslims are expected to undertake the Hajj - which includes a visit to what is said to be the world's first mosque, the Kaaba in the holy city of Mecca, in Saudi Arabia - once in their lifetimes if they have the means to do so.\n\nZeinab Mourad has made the pilgrimage to Mecca three times, including last spring. Alongside thousands of Muslims, she has circled the Kaaba walking counter-clockwise seven times while reciting prayers.\n\n\"I can't speak the language of the person next to me, but we speak the universal language of being Muslim,\" Mourad says.\n\nShe has retraced the steps of Hagar, a woman revered in Islam, who trekked through two desert hills, Safa and Marwa, searching for water for her son.\n\n\"I felt this incredible sense of spirituality walking up and down the mountains,\" Mourad says.\n\nBeing Muslim shapes every aspect of her life.\n\n\"It's a set of morals and values that guide my day-to-day interactions,\" she says. \"It gives me purpose in life. I have often wondered, if I didn't have my faith, would the world have much to offer? You live and die and then what?\"\n\nBut the 30-year-old, who is an academic mentor at the Islamic Sciences and Research Academy, says it can be hard being devout in an increasingly secular society.\n\n\"When you're hanging around in mainstream communities, you can sometimes feel like the crazy people... the delusional one for believing in something that you can't see,\" Mourad says.\n\n\"But people's perceptions give me way less than what my religion offers. It makes it easier to navigate those circumstances and to think 'hang on a second, that person's perception belongs to them' and I have this purpose that I'm working towards in this life.\"\n\nWhile the traditions of Islam have stayed the same for more than a thousand years, much has changed for Australian Muslims, like Mohamed Mohideen, who migrated to Melbourne in the 1990s.\n\nThe cultural diversity of Muslims in Australia has shifted. An influx of people from Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Bangladesh has led to Muslim South Asian migrants surpassing Muslims of Middle Eastern background, including Lebanese and Turkish migrants.\n\nThere has been a surge of migration from Australia's closest neighbour, Indonesia, and a rise in Australian-born Muslims, reflecting the community's higher birth rates.\n\n\"There is a beautiful sense of belonging when you come to a mosque. Because of the unique people of all different ethnic communities you break down barriers,\" Mohideen says.\n\nIn the 1990s, Muslims in Australia were rarely the subject of suspicion or concern. This all changed on September 11, 2001, during al-Qaeda's terrorist attacks on the United States, in which more than 1300 people were killed.\n\nEtched in Mohideen's mind is the voice of his brother, calling him from the US in the middle of the night to tell him about the planes crashing into the World Trade Centre.\n\nHe remembers the flashing of the television screen in the background as fire engulfed the towers. \"It was horrifying,\" he recalls.\n\nAfter the attacks, life for thousands of Muslims in Australia changed.\n\n\"After 9/11, Muslims began to be looked at with suspicion, and it really affected the young people in Australia badly,\" Mohideen says.\n\n\"Even now, the young kids growing up have always had to justify their loyalty to their country. It changed how the Western world saw Muslims forever.\"\n\nAustralian Muslim children were bullied and discriminated against at school, some left so traumatised, they changed their names or concealed their clothing to hide that they were Muslim. Women were too frightened to leave their homes or wear their hijabs after being abused on the street.\n\n\"We said, 'You don't need to feel shame; you have done nothing wrong',\" Mohideen says. \"It felt like the entire Muslim community was condemned.\"\n\nThe shadow of September 11 lingers. Often, Mohideen's first thought, whenever there is a tragedy, such as a car ploughing into three pedestrians in Bourke Street last September, is \"please God, don't let it be a Muslim\".\n\nEarlier this year, a Muslim university student was physically attacked and had her hijab pulled, after she helped two Asians students who were being racially abused on a bus in Glen Waverley.\n\nInternational student Laiba Khan wears her hijab every day, but several of her Muslim friends in Melbourne have stopped wearing theirs at university, following the attack on the bus, worrying they, too, could be targeted.\n\n\"For me, wearing it is a part of me. I feel proud to be Muslim,\" Khan says. \"But every time there is an incident like that, it creates another wave of fear.\"\n\nIt is a fear, she says, worsened by war in the Middle East.\n\nIslamophobia Register Australia data shows Islamophobic attacks have increased 13-fold compared to last year.\n\nSince the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians escalated after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 and Israel responded with a deadly bombing campaign, Mohideen says he has felt the same familiar sense of dread as that caused by September 11.\n\n\"This time it's really different,\" he says. \"We are all watching this devastation unfold online, children being killed in front of our eyes. It makes me worried about how this violence could shape another generation of Muslim kids.\"\n\nBut in any Muslim community, Mohideen says, there is unwavering resilience. A day after the 2019 terrorist massacre at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which killed 51 people, he refused to let fear win.\n\nInstead, he and other Victorian Muslim leaders opened the doors of mosques and welcomed hundreds of fellow Victorians. Together, they grieved.\n\nIt is inside a mosque where Muslims thank God for blessings. It is where the community gathers to rejoice or comfort each other in times of sorrow. Love lives there, too. It is celebrated at weddings and naming ceremonies for babies on their seventh day on Earth.\n\n\"The mosque, in its essence, is community. It is our constant,\" Mohideen says. \"It is our heart and it is our soul.\"",

        "title": "Consequences of an earthquake: Historical chronology of Gerasa",
        "body": "AMMAN -- Plagues, wars and earthquakes shaped the history of urban centres and states. Ancient Gerasa (Jerash) was subjected to a number of major disasters but none shook the town as much as the one in 749 AD.\n\nJerash became occupied around 8,000 BC, where the remains of a Neolithic mega-site have been excavated on Tall Abu Suwwan at the southern extent of the modern city. A Bronze and Iron Age settlement was centred on the southern parts of Jerash, but it has left no traces after the 7th century BC.\n\nHowever, urban history starts around the 2nd century BC when Gerasa became part of a Hellenistic coalition of cities called \"Decapolis\".\n\nThe town revolved around the Temple of Zeus and the Camp Hill and it saw an expansive building boom during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, the peak of the Roman Empire. The most important monuments were built in that phase and Romanised city elites tried to present themselves as good Roman citizens.\n\n\"Some of the major building activities that took place at this time included the inauguration of the rebuilt Temple of Zeus in 163 AD; a series of fountains on the town's axial street [also known as the Cardo] of which the Nymphaeum was the most elaborate; as well as the construction of the South and North Theatres, the Macellum, and the East and West Baths,\" noted Alan Walmsley from the Macquarie University in Australia.\n\nThe Roman Emperor Hadrian visited Gerasa in the winter of 129-130 AD, and an inscription on the Triumphal Arch commemorates the imperial visit.\n\nFrom the 4th to the 6th century AD, Jerash saw a drastic transformation of urban space in which new religious ideas as well as shifting economic priorities were accommodated within the built environment. Most importantly, the institutionalisation of Christianity and its inauguration as the state religion in the 4th century AD, brought the change. Logically, the pagan temples that were the focal point of the city were gradually abandoned and the construction of twenty churches and shrines took place.\n\n\" The Temple of Zeus served as a stone quarry including a stone cutter's workshop, in which building blocks were recut for use elsewhere in town,\" Walmsley said, noting that other parts of the temple served as a metal workshop and as a dumping ground for waste products from a nearby ceramic kiln.\n\nThe Hippodrome became a centre for workshops and ceramic manufacture after its original purpose was changed during the 4th century AD\n\nThe transformation of Gerasa in the fourth to the sixth century entailed not only the repurposing of existing buildings, but also the reconfiguration of entire urban quarters, the historian continued, adding that the area south-east of the Temple of Artemis, for example, was redeveloped to accommodate the construction of a massive church complex comprising the Cathedral, the church of St Theodore, the Fountain Court, the Clergy House and a bathhouse constructed in 454-455 AD by Bishop Placcus.\n\n\"The bathhouse probably replaced an earlier bathing facility located to the east, which was now used for the manufacture of glass and another nearby building was repurposed to accommodate the fitting of an industrial-sized stone-saw,\" the historian said, stressing that in the north-west and south-west districts, new streets were laid out according to the Roman-period grid system.\n\nThe Persian and Arab conquests of Jerash in 602 -630 AD and 634 AD did not have a negative impact on Gerasa as the 7th century appears to have been a time in which financial investments into the urban fabric went towards maintenance rather than building anew, Walmsley underlined, adding that the Arab conquest in 634-638 AD not only brought about a change in rulership, but also the arrival of Islam.\n\n\"With the consolidation of the Umayyad Caliphate [661-750 AD], the impact of the new governmental and religious agendas began to manifest themselves within the urban centres of the caliphate. The introduction of a new imperial religion had no immediate impact on the material culture of Jerash's Christian communities. On the contrary, evidence of the careful removal of figural representations in the mosaic floors of some [but not all] of Jerash's churches confirm the continuous usage of these religious buildings into the first half of the 8th century AD,\" Walmsley elaborated.\n\nThe Early Islamic period is marked by the expansion of artisan quarters and artisan production as well as building of a congregational mosque in the 8th century.\n\n\"The mosque replaced a bathhouse, which had been in use from the 4th century until its increasingly advanced state of disrepair led to it being discontinued and the building eventually dismantled to make way for the construction of a mosque,\" Walmsley said, adding that Jerash's congregational mosque was based on the layout of the Great Mosque in Damascus, which was built in the first half of the 8th century AD in the reign of the caliph Al Walid (ruling between 705 AD and -715 D).\n\nWalmsley maintains that a construction of the congregational mosque took place between 724 and 743 AD. However, the earthquake from 749 AD seriously damaged the mosque and other significant building in Jerash.\n\n\"The damage caused by the earthquake and the following discontinuation of structures is well-documented throughout Jerash and has led scholars to assume a total abandonment of the town -- a sentiment that still lingers today,\" Walmsley highlighted adding that the excavations within northwest Jerash have generally identified a discontinuation after the mid-8th century.\n\nSome traces of the Abbasid-period occupation of the Macellum adds to the evidence as does pottery finds that suggest some continuous activity in the Temple of Zeus, however, the evidence for continuous occupation after 749 AD is by far the strongest in Jerash's commercial and religious centre at the intersection of the two main thoroughfares and in the south-west district.\n\n\"Recent archaeological investigations in Jerash's south-west district suggests that this area was crucial to maintaining the central functions of urban life and therefore, the financial investment in the restoration of the town and the efforts put towards reconstruction were concentrated here,\" Walmsley concluded.",

The funding for the project included a personal donation of SR50 million ($13.3 million) from the crown prince, officials said.\n\nThe Historic Jeddah district contains more than 600 buildings, including 36 mosques, as well as five marketplace sites, ancient squares, and other locations of historical importance, such as the Waterfront, that were vital stopping-off points for Muslim pilgrims in days gone by. Many are being restored and renovated to help preserve and illustrate the history of the Hajj since the dawn of Islam.\n\nBased on directives from the crown prince, the restoration work was carried out by five specialist companies based in Saudi Arabia, officials said, under the supervision of technicians experienced in the preservation of historic buildings. Special care was taken to maintain the unique design and distinctive urban characteristics of the district, they added.\n\nSome of the buildings that were saved, which belong to Jeddah families, have archaeological features dating back as far as 500 years.",

        "body": "The summer transfer window won't reopen in Europe for a while yet, but there are plenty of moves in the works and gossip swirling around. Transfer Talk brings you all the latest buzz on rumours, comings, goings and, of course, done deals!\n\nBayern Munich defender Alphonso Davies does not want to accept a new deal with the club, which makes a move to Real Madrid increasingly likely, per Christian Falk.\n\nDavies has played a vital role for Thomas Tuchel's side this season, featuring 31 times in all competitions, notching one goal and three assists. However, his precarious contractual situation leaves Bayern vulnerable to losing their star defender.\n\nIt is reported that Davies could leave the Bavarian outfit this summer, with Bayern offering the Canada international \u20ac14m per year, falling short of Davies' demand of \u20ac20m per year. With the 23-year-old under contract with the German champions until 2025, Bayern could be forced to part ways with the defender this summer, to ensure he does not leave as a free agent in 2025.\n\nReal Madrid have been reportedly monitoring the situation and could be ready to strike this summer. Davies joined Bayern in January 2019 from Vancouver Whitecaps and has emerged as one of the best left-backs in the world, which has alerted several clubs to his situation. It has been reported that Davies has already reached a verbal agreement with Los Blancos, with the Canadian's departure from the Bavarian club looking increasingly likely.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\n- AC Milan are hopeful of securing a deal for Nice midfielder Khephren Thuram, suggests La Gazzetta dello Sport. It is reported that Milan hold an interest in the 23-year-old and are hoping their chances of finalizing a move are increased by the fact that his brother, Marcus, plies his trade with Internazionale, which could give a chance for the brothers to reconnect in Milan. Whilst the \u20ac40m price tag could prove problematic, the report indicates that with Thuram's contract at Nice expiring in 2025, Nice could drop their asking price to ensure he does not leave as a free agent in 2025.\n\n- Manchester United are interested in Nice defender Jean Clair-Todibo, per Fabrizio Romano. The tweet indicates that Nice value the 24-year-old at \u20ac40m with several clubs in Europe monitoring the France international. Whilst Manchester United hold an interest, it is reported that several other Premier League clubs have joined the race, which could see the defender depart Nice this summer.\n\n- Juventus winger Samuel Iling-Junior could be on the move this summer, per Fabrizio Romano. It is reported that clubs from Italy and England hold an interest in the 20-year-old. The England-youth international is under contract with the Turin club until 2025, however, with no active talks over a new deal, Juventus could cash in on the youngster this summer to ensure he does not leave as a free agent in 2025.\n\n- Crystal Palace are facing competition from Atletico Madrid for Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera, reveal the Evening Standard. The 19-year-old has caught the eye of the Eagles who made an approach in January. The teenager is under contract with Valencia until 2026, however, with the report suggesting that several clubs in Europe are monitoring the defender, Mosquera could be on the move this summer. The report indicates that Atletico Madrid are hopeful that a significant increase in his wages could be enough to tempt Mosquera to the Spanish capital.\n\n- Juventus could attempt to strike a deal for Sunderland midfielder Jobe Bellingham this summer, suggest Calciomercato. The report reveals that the Turin giants were close to securing a deal for his brother Jude, but they will now try to ensure they finalize a move for Jobe, who has endured a fruitful season with Sunderland, netting six goals and one assist in the Championship this season. It is reported that dialogue between the parties has already begun with Juventus paying close attention to the situation.",

As a Yoruba man and as our fathers will say, 'No matter how slippery the bottom of your child is, you must leave the beads there.'\n\n\"Leave the beads there. This is your country; do not condemn it in sermons, do not abuse the nation. Leadership is meant for change.\n\n\"Yes, this leader is bad, fine.

Now the economy is turning the corner,\" the Vice-President said.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Traditional Rulers Council of Nigeria, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, assured the President of the unwavering support of traditional rulers and commended the government's efforts to address the hike in food prices and the security challenges.\n\n\"You are not alone, Mr. President.

        "body": "Family attacked in Illinois stabbing spree praises son, dog for saving their livesMaggie Vespa and Rebecca CohenMarch 29, 2024 at 12:41 AM\n\nROCKFORD, Ill. -- A mother who was injured in an Illinois stabbing spree Wednesday said that if it wasn't for her son, who was also attacked, she and her daughter might not have survived after the attacker entered their home.\n\nDarlene Weber and her children, Jacob Vollman, 21, and Cathy Gilfillan, 23, described the assault. Christian Soto is accused of going on a rampage Wednesday afternoon, ultimately killing four people and injuring seven others, including Weber and her kids.\n\n\"I mean, this is, like, my knight in shining armor, and he's my son. It was like God sent him to me and sent me a gift in a small package and I was blessed with that,\" Weber, 46, said in an interview Thursday.\n\n\"I'm not even kidding. If it wasn't for him, I don't think I'd be standing here talking to you right now,\" she said of her son. \"I really don't. It was frightening.\"\n\nSoto was arrested on charges of murder, attempted murder and home invasion.\n\nWinnebago County State's Attorney J. Hanley said Soto admitted to the crimes and said he had taken marijuana he believed was \"laced with an unknown narcotic\" before the attacks at multiple locations in Rockford and an area of Winnebago County shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday, officials said.\n\nThe attack\n\nWeber said she and her two kids -- all of whom have visible injuries -- were home Wednesday afternoon when she took her pit bull, Brandy. out the back door and heard a man say \"hey\" to her before he stabbed her in the face.\n\nAs she crawled through the house screaming for Vollman to help her, she said, Brandy jumped on and bit the man, giving her enough time to escape.\n\n\"It all happened like such a blink of an eye,\" Weber said. \"Remembering back, it was almost like he literally tried to kill me.\"\n\nShe said Vollman then approached the man as she scrambled to find her phone and call 911.\n\nVollman said he went to find his mom, who was screaming for help, \"and I just turn my head, and he's standing, like, right there. And he literally looks at me and says, 'Come here,' and starts charging at me, and then he swings on me a couple of times.\" He added that he fought the man \"head on.\"\n\nHe said he was hit with a metal ring around the bottom of the knife but was not stabbed with the blade.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of fighting with Vollman, the attacker turned his attention to Gilfillan, who had just awakened at 1 p.m. to screams of \"help, help\" and \"get out of my house, you shouldn't be here,\" she said.\n\nShe said she ran upstairs, where she found her brother \"boxing\" with the man. At first she thought it might have been one of her brother's friends; then, she said, the man turned toward her, charged at her and \"clocked me one\" before she fell into the fetal position.\n\nShe said he was about to hit her again when her brother began \"waling on him\" with a syrup bottle.\n\nGilfillan said the attacker then \"dipped\" out the back door, at which point police arrived.\n\n\"If it wasn't for him,\" she said, referring to Vollman, \"me and mom would not be here.\"\n\n'The devil incarnate'\n\nVollman said the attacker \"had the world's biggest smile on his face\" when he approached him in the home, and Gilfillan said his eyes looked totally black.\n\n\"He had no brown in his eyes. It was straight pupil, like he was on drugs or something,\" Gilfillan said.\n\nWeber said, \"He looked like the devil incarnate.\"\n\nThe three survivors said the man was covered in blood when he arrived at their home, including his hands, sweater and pants.\n\n\"It's like a horror movie,\" Weber said.\n\nThe family, who just moved to the neighborhood in October, said they no longer feel safe there. But Weber said she is \"not going to let somebody like that scare me from ... having a tranquil life with my family.\"\n\nWeber said she \"broke down\" in the aftermath of the assault, because \"I felt kind of guilty that we were survivors and ... you had these innocent people that were taken from their families.\"\n\nThe rampage also claimed the lives of Soto's friend Jacob Schupbach, 23; his friend's mother, Ramona Schupbach, 63; a mailman doing his job, Jay Larson; and Jenna Newcomb, 15, who died saving her sister.\n\nSoto told police that he went to Jacob Schupbach's house Wednesday afternoon to smoke marijuana and that he thinks it was laced, causing him to become paranoid, Hanley, the state's attorney, told reporters.\n\nSoto \"said he retrieved a knife from the kitchen at Jacob's house and proceeded to stab Jacob and Ramona to death,\" Hanley said.\n\nWeber said: \"I can't even wrap my head around what happened yesterday. It's so hard to just sit here and just talk about it or to even replay it. I just can't get that picture of him standing there and saying 'hey' to me and then the reach. I can only imagine what everyone else went through.\"",

Seventy-eight students were registered and pre-registered to vote this year during the event.\n\nMany students were unaware that they could pre-register to vote at the age of 16 and were excited to pre-register. Others participated in an interest poll and took social activist \"selfie\" photos. The poll's top issues of concern for students were: Cost of college (29.6 %), immigration issues (24.1%), women's reproductive rights (14.8%), the state of the economy/inflation (16.7%), and gun control (7.4%), respectively. (There were 54 responses to the poll.)\n\n\"It was interesting to see how easy it actually is to pre-register. The process itself takes no more than three minutes, making it simple for anyone who has a spare moment to take advantage of their political power,\" said senior Evan Hoyos.\n\n\"Being able to register to vote inspired me to want to be more informed about upcoming elections. The event made many feel empowered to make change using their vote,\" said junior Christian Blanco.\n\n\"It makes me hopeful for the future to see so many of our youth showing interest in current events, being excited to make their voices heard, and wanting to be involved in our community,\" said Amy Hennings, teacher and club advisor.\n\n\"For the second year it has been an honor and delight to come to the Santa Maria High School campus to observe the voter registration and pre-registration work of the campus club, Close Up Washington DC. Sandy Boyd and I left with an armload of registration forms representing the hopes the young future voters have for our great country,\" said Virginia Souza, president of LWVNSBC.",

        "body": "Selling Sunset star Christine Quinn's estranged husband Christian Dumontet tried to keep a low profile on Wednesday in Los Angeles. The 44-year-old was captured by photographers on March 27, the same day his request for a restraining order against his wife of four years was denied.\n\nQuinn, 35, and Dumontet made headlines recently after she accused him of domestic violence and requested her own restraining order against her husband. Dumontet was arrested after an incident where he allegedly threw a bag containing a glass bottle at Quinn, which hit their 2-year-old son instead. He was arrested again the next day for violating Quinn's emergency protection order.\n\nIn this photo, taken March 27 in Los Angeles, Dumontet, wearing a long-sleeved blue shirt, gets into the passenger side of a Ford pickup truck with an American flag decal on the back window.\n\nEarlier in March, Quinn accused her spouse of flying into a fit of rage and throwing things at her after they had an argument about finances. That prompted the Netflix star to call 911 and eventually request that the court order Dumontet to stay away from her and this son.\n\nIn court documents (via ET), Quinn requested sole custody with monitored visitation for Dumontet. She said she was afraid Dumontet, who is a citizen of France, might take their child to that country, where he has family connections.\n\nIn his request for a restraining order, Dumontet denied Quinn's allegations of domestic violence. He said they had an argument over cleaning up after Quinn's dogs, during which he threw a trash bag at the wall, not at his wife or child. He also claimed the bag contained no glass.\n\nDumontet, who has also appeared on Selling Sunset under the name Christian Richard, wanted joint custody of their child. He said he was afraid Quinn would \"abduct\" their son and \"has a history of threatening to take away or hide our children from me,\" according to People His request for a restraining order was denied, Page Six reported on March 27.\n\nQuinn and Dumontet, a tech entrepreneur, married in December 2019 in a lavish wedding. The pair's gothic nuptials were featured in Selling Sunset Season 3. She gave birth to their first child in May 2021, an experience that she described as traumatic.\n\n\"Both myself, and baby Christian are lucky to be alive,\" she wrote in a July 2021 Instagram post. \"After my water broke the day I was filming, I was rushed to the hospital already 9cm dilated. Hyperventilating from the excruciating pain, I was immediately rushed in to an emergency crash C-section due to both our heart rates instantly plummeting.\" Her son's umbilical cord was also wrapped around his neck, Quinn said, and he was \"seconds away from not making it.\"\n\n\"I am so grateful for the doctors and surgeons that saved BOTH of us,\" she wrote.\n\nHow to get help: In the U.S., call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or text START to 88788",

        "title": "Sri Lanka Grapples with Trauma of Jihadist Easter Massacre Five Years Later",
        "body": "Sri Lanka will mark its fifth Easter since the harrowing April 21, 2019, jihadist suicide bombings that killed 275 people and injured dozens of others, deliberately targeting crowded churches and popular hotel brunch spots.\n\nThe country's leaders are still addressing the trauma left by the Islamic State-claimed attack on Sri Lanka's sizable Christian community, promising heightened security this week including body checks on attendees at some of the country's largest Easter Sunday Masses.\n\nDuring a press conference on Tuesday, the national police force announced a \"special security plan\" to protect churches consisting of constant communication with priests and other Christian leaders and full inspections of the nation's largest searches before services on Good Friday and Easter Sunday.\n\n\"Under this security plan, the church premises would be inspected before the commencement of the sermons in a manner that does not disturb the devotees,\" the Sri Lankan news outlet Ada Derana reported. \"Further, if it is deemed necessary to conduct body searches before allowing the devotees to enter the church premises, the police officers are instructed to make necessary preparations after discussing with the priests and boards of trustees of respective churches.\"\n\nSri Lanka's Catholic Bishops Conference issued a statement on Thursday recognizing the five-year anniversary of the massacre, demanding changes to the government generally and justice for the victims.\n\n\"It has been five years since the Easter Sunday mayhem where more than 275 people were killed and scores became patients. We request the authorities to be close to the hearts of these suffering people and mete out justice to them,\" the statement read in part.\n\n\"Easter is being celebrated at a time when the country is facing a severe social, political and economical crisis. It is essential to bring in a major change to the country's governing system to ease the people's suffering,\" the bishops continued. \"It is the responsibility of all citizens to work towards bringing this change.\"\n\nSuicide bombers detonated explosive vests at six locations, all churches or hotels hosting Easter brunches, on Easter 2019. Eyewitnesses described the bombers detonating at the back of the churches, where parents of young children were more likely to experience the Mass standing close to the door, allowing for a rapid departure if their child became unruly or needed to eat. The damage to the bodies of the victims was so significant that Sri Lankan authorities initially counted the death toll to be nearly 360 people, but revised it down as they began to identify multiple body parts belonging to the same people.\n\n\"I couldn't bear to watch burning babies and children. But everyone rushed in to help. This is a brutal strike,\" one eyewitness identified as \"Hamza\" told Sri Lanka's Daily Mirror.\n\nThe Islamic State's Amaq \"news agency\" took credit for the attack and published photos of the alleged attackers. Sri Lankan authorities identified the culprits, however, as belonging to a local group called \"National Thowheed Jama'ath,\" which it disbanded, and named the mastermind and head recruiter as radical imam Mohammed Zahran Hashim.\n\nSri Lanka is a majority Buddhist country with significant Muslim and Christian minorities. Most Christians in the country are Catholic, hence the targeting of Sunday Mass. The Buddhist majority, in government and religious leadership, responded to the attack with outrage and violence against Muslims. Angry mobs targeted Muslim businesses and Buddhist monks called for the stoning of Muslims after rumors spread among the Buddhists that Muslim restaurants were making food intended to sterilize non-Muslims. The government launched a mass deportation program and banned Islamic garb, such as the hijab, in public.\n\nThe government of then-President Maithripala Sirisena was in a state of extreme turmoil at the time of the attacks, fueled by a power struggle between Sirisena, allied with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and then-Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Distracted by their disputes, the head of Sri Lanka's State Intelligence Service (SIS) Sisira Mendis told the Sri Lankan Parliament in May 2019 that the government was notified of an imminent jihadist attack shortly before the bombings and did nothing about them. The inaction was partially attributed to various sectors of the Sri Lankan defense apparatus being under the auspices of Sirisena or Wickremesinghe, but not both, and thus failing to communicate the warnings with each other.\n\nSirisena vacated the presidency shortly thereafter, succeeded by Mahinda's brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee the country in July 2022 after his poor management of the country led to massive, violent mob protests that culminated with a mob storming the presidential residence and throwing a party in the president's private pool.\n\nVideo footage circulating on social media shows protestors bathing at President's House. pic.twitter.com/cMfoYV6VXu\n\n-- DailyMirror (@Dailymirror_SL) July 9, 2022\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe emerged as president as Sri Lanka, but not before rioters set his house on fire.\n\nSirisena had largely remained out of the public eye since he stepped down from the presidency. He abruptly returned to new headlines on March 22, when he claimed that he knew who was \"behind\" the Easter 2019 bombings, but that he would only tell a court if it was kept \"confidential.\" Given that the Islamic State took credit for the attack and the name and photo of the alleged mastermind were available shortly after the attack, it is unclear exactly who Sirisena wishes to implicate.\n\nSirisena also claimed that he only came about the information of the \"real\" orchestrators of the attack less than a month ago, without elaborating.\n\n\"If the Court summoned me, I'll appear and testify under the confidential agreement. The reason for this arrangement is that I fear the safety of not only myself and my children but also other family members if I were to testify in an open court,\" Sirisena said.\n\n\"He should be arrested immediately,\" local priest Father Rohan Silva denounced this week, responding to Sirisena's announcement. \"If an ordinary person had made such a serious statement, they would have been arrested and interrogated by the police already.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Public Security has reportedly launched an investigation into Sirisena.",

        "title": "Communist Nicaragua Sentences Christian Pastors to 12-15 Years in Prison on Holy Week",
        "body": "The communist regime in Nicaragua announced the conviction of 11 pastors associated with the Evangelical Mountain Gateway ministry and humanitarian organization, this week on dubious and unspecified charges of \"money laundering,\" sentencing the accused to between 12 and 15 years in prison.\n\nNicaragua - led by the radical Marxist Sandinista regime of Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo - officially convicted the pastors on March 19, but handed down the sentences on Wednesday. Two of those arrested, pastors Walner Omier Bland\u00f3n Ochoa and wife Marisela de F\u00e1tima Mej\u00eda Ruiz, received 15-year sentences. The other ten - Marcos Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez Jir\u00f3n, Harry Lening Rios Bravo, Manuel de Jes\u00fas R\u00edos Flores, Jos\u00e9 Luis Orozco Urrutia, \u00c1lvaro Daniel Escobar Caldera, Juan Carlos Chavarr\u00eda Zapata, Juan Luis Moncada, Orvin Alexis Moncada Castellano, and C\u00e9sar Facundo Burgalin Miranda - received 12-year sentences. All faced charges of \"aggravated money laundering.\"\n\nIn addition, according to the Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa, the court imposed a fine of $80 million per pastor arrested - nearly a billion dollars in fines - and two attorneys attempting to aid in the defense of the Christians, Isabel Cristina Acevedo Sol\u00eds and Maricarmen Espinoza Segura, were sentenced to ten years in prison and similarly fined tens of millions of dollars.\n\nBoth Mountain Gateway and ADF International, a faith-based legal advocacy organization, denounced the entire case as a \"sham.\" ADF International is helping Mountain Gateway appeal the case and presented the case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights seeking measures to protect the prisoners of conscience.\n\n\"ADF International has asked the Commission to demand that Nicaragua ensure the right to health, life, and physical integrity of the pastors during their stay in prison, while the proceedings are ongoing,\" the group said in a press release on Wednesday.\n\n\"In addition to being barred from meeting with their legal representation or their families, the lawyers on the case were denied access to case files and other relevant documentation against the pastors,\" the organization denounced. \"During the sham trial, the government was unable to produce any evidence of the alleged illicit activity or where the alleged unlawful funds that were 'laundered' originated.\"\n\nThe incident is the latest in a campaign of brutal and often violent repression of Christians in the majority-Christian country, timed to coincide with Holy Week in the non-Orthodox Christian world, a period during which Christians observe the crucifixion of Jesus and celebrate his resurrection.\n\nThe Sandinista regime has previously timed its acts of repression against the Christian faith to align with Christian holidays; the regime abruptly seized Mountain Gateway's assets and arrested the pastors involved shortly before Christmas. Also in late December, Sandinista authorities arrested Catholic Bishop Isidoro Mora, as he had presided over a Mass during which those congregated prayed for imprisoned and persecuted members of the Catholic clergy.\n\nThe Sandinistas have also deployed police officers to silence Christians attempting to participate in traditional religious events such as the celebration in December of the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\n\nThe repression has not been limited to churches and faith organizations. Ortega has shut down more than 3,500 nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations since 2018, when mass anti-communist protests in the country, in part fueled by Christian teachings, erupted. The Ortega-Murillo regime killed more than 300 people in 2018 in response to the peaceful movement against their ideology.\n\nMountain Gateway is an organization founded by American Pastor Jon Britton Hancock that initially worked almost exclusively to offer humanitarian aid to Nicaraguans after natural disasters and advice and support to farmers in remote parts of the country. Last year, Hancock began organizing mass evangelizing events for prayer, reflection, and community, attracting as many as 200,000 people at a time.\n\n\"We saw a massive move of God involving hundreds of thousands of people. That has been a tremendous influence in the hearts of the people of Nicaragua,\" Hancock told Breitbart News in February.\n\nMountain Gateway had announced plans for at least 13 evangelizing campaign events in the country in 2024, receiving no negative feedback from the government or any indication that it would face resistance. Before it could plan the events, however, their local pastors were arrested, accused of \"money laundering\" and \"organized crime,\" and the Sandinistas levied criminal charges against Hancock and two other Americans, son Jacob Britton Hancock and daughter-in-law Cassandra Mae Hancock, on unspecified charges.\n\n\"I do think that the size of the Gospel Campaigns and the amount of people they drew could be seen as threatening to the government,\" Hancock told Breitbart News. \"Again, I'm not sure why they are targeting us after we have worked to maintain a respectful relationship and abide by their policies and laws.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Hancock issued a statement reiterating the organization's faith and confirming Mountain Gateway would continue its campaign to defend its pastors.\n\n\"While we are certainly dismayed at the formal conviction of our colleagues and friends in Nicaragua, we remain steadfast in our hope that God is in control,\" Hancock said. \"We will do everything in our power to secure justice for friends in Nicaragua, and we ask you to join us in praying for their safety and swift release.\"",

        "title": "How Latin American Muslims observe Ramadan amid sadness and",
        "body": "SAO PAULO: Throughout Latin America, Muslim communities are observing Ramadan this year without the atmosphere of festivity that is common during the iftar meal owing to the suffering in Gaza, where more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on Oct. 7.\n\n\"This will be one of the worst Ramadan celebrations for us,\" said Bashar Shakerat, a community leader in an area on the border between Uruguay and Brazil called Little Palestine due to the relatively high concentration of Palestinian immigrants.\n\n\"We're praying at the mosque and there's no festivity later. Everybody is sad.\"\n\nOn Sundays during Ramadan, women traditionally cook large meals and people gather at the social club to celebrate. On weeknights, groups usually gather at home for iftar. Shakerat said nothing like that is happening this year.\n\n\"We just want to pray and stay quiet at home,\" he told Arab News. \"We just want this war to be over. We're tired. We want peace.\"\n\nBorn in the Palestinian city of Jenin, Shakerat said he has family in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as do many of the residents of Little Palestine.\n\n\"We traditionally collect food kits and distribute them among needy families in our city. We know that our brothers and sisters in Palestine are also starving,\" he added.\n\nMuslim communities in Latin America do not have a high number of Palestinians. Even so, the feeling of closeness to Gazans is omnipresent.\n\n\"Our mosque was founded decades ago by Palestinian immigrants. They moved to other cities or died over the years, and now most of our community are Africans or Brazilians,\" Turkish-born Sheikh Adil Pechliye, spiritual leader of Palestine Mosque in the Brazilian city of Criciuma, told Arab News.\n\nDespite the demographic change in the community, the mosque's members still have a deep connection to Palestine, said Pechliye, who graduated in Madinah in 2001.\n\n\"We've joined Criciuma's pro-Palestine committee, and have been active in protests and marches against the genocide in Gaza,\" he added.\n\nPechliye has been giving lectures on Palestine, and gave a Friday sermon in a public square a few weeks ago in order to disseminate information on Gaza.\n\nA couple of months ago, the Muslim community promoted a relief campaign and sent aid to the Palestinian enclave.\n\nPechliye believes that most Brazilians support the Palestinians despite the pro-Israel stance of the Brazilian press.\n\nHe praised President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has been fiercely critical of Israel and even compared what is happening in Gaza to the Holocaust.\n\n\"The Holocaust was undeniably terrible, but I don't think Lula tried to downplay its seriousness. He wanted to emphasize the horror of what's happening now,\" Pechliye said.\n\nIn the city of Santa Ana in El Salvador, the Muslim community also gathers to pray at a mosque named Palestine.\n\nMezquita Palestina Tierra Santa was founded in 2011 by a community that is almost completely made up of converted Salvadorans.\n\n\"We wished to honor Armando Bukele, who introduced Islam to El Salvador and whose family came from Palestine,\" Sheikh Guillermo Sanchez told Arab News.\n\nBukele was born in El Salvador to Christian parents from Palestine, but he converted to Islam and was an imam for several years. His son Nayib is the current president of El Salvador.\n\nSanchez said his community \"has strong ties with Palestine, and has been struggling to support Gazans in every way possible. A few weeks ago, we promoted a campaign to collect donations and sent it to Gaza.\"\n\nIn the Colombian city of Cali, the Muslim community is in constant sorrow for the Palestinians, said Egyptian-born Sheikh Amr Nabil.\n\n\"At night we'll have something to eat with our brothers here, but Gazans won't have anything,\" he told Arab News. \"That's very painful, and at the same time it helps us understand the injustices of our world.\"\n\nSince the beginning of Ramadan, the community in Cali has been praying for the Palestinians, and leaders such as Nabil have been giving lectures about Palestine and the roots of the conflict.\n\n\"I believe that only somebody who is completely uninformed about the Palestinian struggle is capable of supporting the ongoing genocide, or it's a person who has completely lost humanity,\" he said.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has criticized on several occasions Israel's attacks on Gaza. Many Muslims in the South American nation support his stance.\n\n\"His declarations are those of a human being who expressed solidarity to a people that's being massacred. We appreciate it very much,\" Nabil said.\n\nSheikh Abu Yahya, a Mexican-born community leader who converted to Islam 12 years ago, told Arab News this is \"the most difficult Ramadan. Our community in (the city of) Leon is formed by Mexican converts and by Muslims from Arab countries. We're all equally sad.\"\n\nHe said the community has been focusing on \"developing empathy and suffering together with those who are suffering, so prayers for the Palestinians have been constant.\"\n\nAbu Yahya added: \"We decided to take part in the local pro-Palestinian committee. We've been taking part in several activities and sharing information about Palestine.\"\n\nHe said amid pro-Israel campaigns in the Mexican media, many Mexicans do not have adequate information about what is happening in Gaza.\n\n\"That's noticeable during our lectures, but when people discover the reality, they express their solidarity with the Palestinians,\" he added.\n\nMany Latin Americans have been receiving information and images of the victims in Gaza via social media, which has been impacting the perceptions of a growing number of people in the region.\n\n\"The war doesn't spare anyone, and hunger is undoubtedly the worst way of dying. That's why it's impossible not to think about Gazans during Ramadan,\" said Shakerat.",

        "body": "Female inmates sexually exploited by an ex-Riverside County sheriff's deputy responsible for supervising them on a home detention program are federally suing the county, sheriff's administrators and others for alleged civil rights violations, it was announced Thursday.\n\n\"Deputy (Christian) Heidecker sexually preyed upon the plaintiff(s) and took advantage of (their) vulnerabilities,\" according to a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Riverside. \"Heidecker's conduct clearly shocks the conscience.\"\n\nHeidecker, 32, of Menifee pleaded guilty in February to four counts each of extortion, a public official seeking bribes and witness intimidation, as well as one count of a detention officer perpetrating a sexual assault.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Charles Rogers accepted the plea over the objections of prosecutors, who opposed the stipulated term of five years in state prison for being too low, but Rogers imposed it anyway.\n\nThe criminal complaint identified only four victims, all by their initials -- \"A.A.,\" \"A.R.,\" \"K.P.\" and \"O.C.\" But the plaintiffs' attorneys added three additional women, whose identities also were not disclosed, in the federal civil action. It seeks unspecified damage awards, along with other sanctions, for alleged violations of protections guaranteed under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\n\"Criminal behavior is not only unacceptable, it is referred to law enforcement,\" according to a county Executive Office statement. \"In this situation, the county investigated, arrested, prosecuted and reached a conviction for Heidecker. Upon receipt of these lawsuits, the county will review them thoroughly to determine next steps.\"\n\nHeidecker made a confession last Sept. 1, after one of his victims furnished information to his superiors, prompting an internal investigation.\n\nThe principal complaint contains a narrative of the disgraced ex-lawman's sordid history tied to one victim -- K.P.\n\n\"K.P. (and) the other victims were coerced ... fearful that they had to abide by the desires of Heidecker to remain out of jail,\" according to the civil filing. For the defendant, this susceptibility made these women great candidates, vulnerable due to their fear and status.\"\n\nHeidecker, who became a deputy in April 2018, was a case manager in the Coordinated Custody Management Unit, supervising inmates from the Smith Correctional Facility in Banning who had qualified for the Riverside Alternative Sentencing Program, or RASP.\n\nRASP permits qualifying in-custody inmates -- either serving a jail sentence or still in the adjudication process, awaiting trial but unable to post bail -- to remain at home with GPS ankle monitors to track their movements, remaining confined during certain hours of the day and free to go out at other times, such as for work, school or essential errands.\n\nCase managers decide when to permit free time or assign confinement, as well as dictating other terms by which the RASP detainees must abide. The program requires a contract with Sentinel Offender Services LLC, which provides the ankle monitors and mobile phones that contain tracking data observed by case managers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege Sentinel's previous coordinator for the Smith Correctional Facility program, Karisma Vaca, facilitated Heidecker's illicit acts because she was in \"romantic and sexual relations\" with him.\n\n\"The grooming of K.P. and others could have stopped ... had there been no complacency by employees at Sentinel, including Vaca,\" according to the suit.\n\nSentinel is a named defendant in the civil action.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege Heidecker engaged in a re-occurring pattern of sexual abuse, sometimes beginning with the female candidates he hand-picked to participate in RASP, even though any incarcerated party can apply for admission.\n\nAccording to the suit, Heidecker would begin by communicating with the victims via his Sentinel cell, soliciting photographs to \"update pictures on file.\"\n\n\"The conversation would then take a disturbing turn when the defendant would praise the photos he received,\" according to the narrative. \"Heidecker insisted on photos of feet without socks ... to fully depict the electronic monitor but (actually) part of his sexual gratification in order to satisfy his foot fetish.\"\n\nThe more compliance he received from his charges, the more emboldened he became, the plaintiffs said, pressuring the women to communicate with him via his personal cell and demanding that they delete all private conversations afterward, or face the possibility of losing privileges under RASP.\n\n\"Once the defendant was able to establish dominance, his requests became more sexual in nature,\" the complaint said.\n\nHe would demand \"RASP participants engage in sexual acts\" and that they video \"themselves engaging in sexual acts\" and send the videos to him, the plaintiffs wrote.\n\nIf he detected a lack of compliance, Heidecker would routinely threaten the women with \"more restrictive curfew hours,\" \"lockdown\" and a \"return to (jail) custody,\" according to the complaint.\n\nK.P. came under his control in August 2023 and received \"threatening messages about his power to put her back in jail\" for not fulfilling his personal requests, the attorneys said. The woman feared losing custody of her 5-year-old son and was initially obedient. However, the abuse ended when Heidecker's behavior was outed weeks later, and he gave a full confession.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege there was an attempt by sheriff's Professional Standards Bureau Correctional Sgt. Jessica Yelenich and the county's private attorney, Nicole Roggeven, to pay K.P. and the other victims \"hush money\" in September.\n\n\"Yelenich and Roggeveen created a list of Heidecker's victims, and one by one, they offered them money in exchange to waiving their right to sue the county,\" the complaint states.\n\nA $5,000 check was written to K.P. However, unnamed higher-ups in county government rejected the plan, according to the suit.\n\n\"It is not uncommon to seek settlement prior to litigation to avoid the time and expense for both sides with lawsuits,\" the county stated.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege Heidecker actively abused his authority for \"years.\" A video, titled \"Big Dick Deputies,\" which was produced and circulated among sheriff's personnel, depicted Heidecker and other deputies on the job. It pointed to disciplinary shortcomings in the department that may have set the stage for the ex-lawman's offenses, according to the complaint.",

They said the child was seriously injured.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

They said it appeared that the driver lost control and was one of the dead.\n\nMinister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga was in Limpopo province for a road safety campaign and changed plans to visit the crash scene, the national Department of Transport said. She said there was an investigation underway into the cause of the crash and offered her condolences to the families of the victims.\n\nThe South African government often warns of the danger of road accidents during the Easter holidays, which is a particularly busy and dangerous time for road travel. More than 200 people died in road crashes during the Easter weekend last year.\n\nThe Zionist Christian Church has its headquarters in Moria and its Easter pilgrimage attracts hundreds of thousands of people from across South Africa and neighboring countries. This year is the first time the Easter pilgrimage to Moria is set to go ahead since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nYou might be interested in Breaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star Dec 31, 1969 Breaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star Dec 31, 1969\n\n___\n\nAP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW",

        "title": "With 3rd Democratic senator opposed, Biden judicial nominee in jeopardy",
        "body": "President Biden's pick to be the first Muslim American appeals court judge appears to be in jeopardy after a third Democratic senator came out against him Wednesday, part of a groundswell of opposition over the nominee's ties to an organization that represents Muslim, Arab and South Asian law students and a group that advocates for incarcerated people and their families.\n\nSen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., told the Nevada Independent that she would not support Adeel A. Mangi's nomination to the Philadelphia-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, citing \"concerns I've heard from law enforcement in Nevada.\"\n\nRosen is the third Democratic senator -- and second senator from Nevada -- to come out against Mangi, a Harvard- and Oxford-trained lawyer in private practice who has been accused by Republican senators of being antisemitic and anti-police.\n\nSens. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., have also said they would not vote for him. Cortez Masto expressed concerns about Mangi's membership on the advisory board of the criminal justice reform group Alliance of Families for Justice. Manchin told Politico he will not vote for any judicial nominee who does not have at least some bipartisan support.\n\nThe White House said Thursday that it is still trying to marshal support for Mangi and convince lawmakers that the attacks against him are baseless.\n\n\"Some Senate Republicans and their extreme allies are relentlessly smearing Adeel Mangi with baseless accusations that he is anti-police,\" White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients said in a statement. \"That could not be further from the truth, and the close to a dozen law enforcement organizations that have endorsed him agree.\"\n\nThe White House earlier this month called the attacks against Mangi a \"cruel, Islamophobic, smear campaign.\"\n\nRepublicans and conservative groups such as the Judicial Crisis Network have accused Mangi of sharing antisemitic views espoused by panelists who spoke at events hosted by Rutgers Law School's Center for Security, Race and Rights. Mangi, an experienced litigator and a partner at a New York law firm, previously served as a member of the center's advisory board.\n\nIn 2021, on the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2021, attacks, the center hosted a roundtable discussion that featured several controversial speakers. Republicans criticized that event and a more recent lecture on life under \"violent occupation and settler colonial violence in Palestine,\" which the center hosted just days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 Israelis and included the kidnapping of about 250 hostages. During Mangi's Dec. 13 nomination hearing, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned him about the Hamas attack and whether he believed they were justified.\n\n\"The events of October 7 were horrific. A horror,\" Mangi said, noting that his time on the center's advisory board did not mean he shares the views of all who work or speak there. \"The attacks on civilians were abominable and against everything that I stand for.\"\n\nMangi has separately drawn criticism from more than a dozen law enforcement organizations, such as the Police Conference of New York, according to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. But other groups, including the International Law Enforcement Officers Association and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, are supporting him, as are the AFL-CIO, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee and a coalition of more than a dozen Jewish organizations.\n\n\"Mr. Mangi has displayed the qualities of leadership, empathy, excellence, and persistence in supporting and defending the U.S. Constitution while ensuring equal protection and justice for all Americans,\" NOBLE wrote in an endorsement letter reviewed by The Post.\n\nPriya Purandare, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, also expressed support for Mangi in a statement. \"The baseless attacks against Mr. Mangi have a chilling effect,\" she said. \"If left unanswered, the nation runs the risk of losing a generation of talent who shares Mr. Mangi's faith from entering public service and the opportunity to compose a federal bench that reflects the changing demographics of the United States. History will remember this moment.\"\n\nWith Cortez Masto, Manchin and Rosen opposed to his confirmation, Mangi would need the support of moderate Republicans such as Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to be confirmed. The Judicial Crisis Network has launched anti-Mangi ads in Montana, Pennsylvania and D.C., targeting Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Bob Casey, D-Pa.\n\nIf Biden pulls Mangi's nomination or he withdraws, it would be a rare defeat for a president who has made diversifying the nation's federal judiciary a key priority. Biden nominated Zahid N. Quraishi as the first Muslim federal district court judge early in his term.\n\nMangi would be Biden's third judicial nominee to withdraw. Michael Delaney gave up his nomination to the Boston-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit in May following Democratic concerns about his past work defending a New Hampshire boarding school in a lawsuit over sexual assault.\n\nLess than a week later, Jabari Wamble dropped his bid to become a U.S. district judge in Kansas. The White House didn't provide an explanation for the withdrawal, but The Associated Press, citing an official familiar with the confirmation process who spoke on the condition of anonymity, reported that Wamble was expecting to receive a \"not qualified\" rating from the American Bar Association, which grades judicial candidates.\n\nThe firestorm surrounding Mangi's nomination comes at a time of heightened political sensitivity surrounding the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and Israel's prolonged military response. Threats against Arab, Jewish and Muslim Americans are on the rise, according to federal officials, and college campuses have been embroiled in angry debates over Zionism, Palestinian rights, antisemitism and free speech.\n\nBut Mangi's supporters, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., still stand behind him.\n\n\"When we look at Mr. Mangi's record -- his professional life, his commitment to religious freedom and civil rights, his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee -- it only reinforces his commitment to upholding and advancing the fundamental values we all hold as Americans,\" Booker said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"I'm proud to champion his nomination and I know the White House, Senate Democratic leaders, and I stand behind Adeel Mangi 100 percent.\"",

        "title": "Can The UN Security Council Help Bring Peace To Gaza? - Analysis",
        "body": "By Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA)\n\nAfter 171 days of conflict in Gaza, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) finally adopted a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan. Introduced by Mozambique on behalf of the elected Council members (E-10) on 25 March, Resolution 2728 received 14 votes in favour and one abstention (United States).1 It calls for a ceasefire respected by all parties for lasting peace, demanding the unconditional release of hostages and ensuring humanitarian access.\n\nThe resolution ended the state of paralysis of the Security Council and its repeated failures to effectively address the conflict in Gaza. However, despite the unified stance of the Council on ceasefire, Israel's response has raised doubts about the resolution's effectiveness in achieving peace. The US decision to abstain from the vote prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel the scheduled visit of his top advisers to the US for discussions on the offensive.2 Two ministers in Netanyahu's war cabinet have also declared that the country will not abide by the resolution, further complicating the path to peace.3\n\nOn 7 October 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a large-scale armed attack against Israel, firing thousands of rockets and conducting raids in border areas, resulting in approximately 1,200 civilian deaths and the capture of 253 hostages. In response, Israel conducted air strikes against Hamas in Gaza. Subsequently, on 28 October, Israel initiated a ground offensive with the objective of eliminating Hamas and rescuing the hostages. United Nations reports that since 7 October, over 1,200 Israelis were killed, with more than 5,500 injured, while nearly 32,000 Palestinians were killed and about 73,000 injured.4\n\nSince the conflict began, the Security Council has voted on nine resolutions; however, only two have been adopted. The first three drafts were vetoed by the US. The first resolution on 16 October 2023 drafted by Russia proposed an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It was however not adopted due to US veto.5 The draft received support from China, Gabon, Mozambique and the United Arab Emirates, while France, Japan, the US and the United Kingdom voted against it. The remaining six Council members abstained from voting.6\n\nThe second resolution was drafted by Brazil, and voted on 18 October. Twelve of the Council's 15 members voted in favour, while the US voted against, and Russia and the UK abstained.7 The UNSC also rejected two amendments proposed by Russia in the Brazilian draft, which called for an immediate, durable and full ceasefire, as well as for stopping attacks against civilians. The US explained the veto by stating that the resolution did not mention Israel's right of self-defence.8\n\nOn 25 October, the UNSC voted on two competing draft resolutions -- one from the US and the other from Russia -- addressing the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The US' draft failed due to the vetoes of China and Russia. The Russian draft saw the US and the UK voting against it, while China, Gabon, Russia and the UAE favoured it, with nine members abstaining.9\n\nAfter a series of negotiations, on 15 November, the UNSC adopted its first resolution on Gaza since the war began. Proposed by Malta, the resolution called for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip to facilitate the provision of essential goods and services. It was adopted with 12 votes in favour and three abstentions (Russia, the UK and the US).10 However, on 8 December, the US vetoed another resolution drafted by the UAE. There were 13 votes in favour and the United Kingdom abstained.11\n\nOn 22 December, the UNSC adopted a resolution requesting the Secretary-General to appoint a Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator to establish a UN mechanism for speeding up humanitarian aid to Gaza.12 The resolution called for 'urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days to enable full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access'.13 It also emphasised the need for creating conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\n\nOn 20 February 2024, Algeria drafted a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Despite receiving support from 13 out of 15 members, the resolution failed to pass, with the UK abstaining and the US voting against it.14 Again on 22 March, Russia and China vetoed a US draft that demanded a temporary ceasefire in Gaza.15 Three days later, the UNSC adopted Resolution 2728, effectively ending the nearly six-month-long paralysis of the Council regarding a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nResolution 2728 calls for an immediate ceasefire during the month of Ramadan, which should be respected by all parties and lead to a lasting and sustainable ceasefire. It also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, along with ensuring humanitarian access to address their medical and other needs. Furthermore, it demands that all parties comply with their obligations under international law regarding the detainees.\n\nThe resolution carries political implications beyond its text, particularly due to the US decision to abstain, which enabled its adoption. In the past six months, the United States has vetoed five draft resolutions, three of which demanded a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nFollowing the abstention, US explained that it did not oppose Resolution 2728 because its text aligns with Washington's position that any ceasefire text must include provisions for the release of hostages.16 The US said that a ceasefire would strengthen negotiations by Egypt, Israel, Qatar, and the US to achieve the release of hostages.\n\nThe US decision not to veto the resolution signalled the White House's growing frustration with Israeli actions, including hospital attacks and aid restrictions in Gaza. Previously, the US had warned against Netanyahu's plans for a ground offensive in Rafah.17 Furthermore, criticism against the Biden administration is mounting, both domestically and internationally. Nonetheless, the US abstention did not signify a change in Washington's policy towards Israel. Last week, the US Congress approved US$ 3.8 billion in military aid to Israel and suspended funding to the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) until March 2025.\n\nIsrael's response to the resolution indicates its reluctance to accept a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has a history of flouting UNSC resolutions. For instance, in December 2016, the UNSC passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Palestine as illegal and a violation of international law. Despite receiving 14 votes in favour and a US abstention, Israel chose to ignore this resolution.\n\nIf Israel chooses the same path on Resolution 2728, the UNSC has limited options. The Council can pass another resolution specifically addressing the breach. This subsequent resolution may include punitive measures, such as imposing sanctions. However, it is unlikely that the US supports a resolution at the UNSC that imposes punitive measures against Israel. In such a scenario, Resolution 2728 would serve solely as a symbolic gesture, recognising the UNSC's limited influence on global peace and security issues. Nevertheless, the Council's ability to reach a consensus on the text, after five previous vetoes on the matter, may be viewed as a glimmer of hope.\n\nViews expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrrikar IDSA or of the Government of India.\n\nAbout the author: Dr Rajeesh Kumar is Associate Fellow at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.",

        "title": "Colombia Expels Argentine Diplomats After Javier Milei Calls Socialist President a 'Terrorist Murderer'",
        "body": "Colombian far-left President Gustavo Petro ordered on Wednesday the expulsion of Argentine diplomatic personnel from the country in response to statements by Argentine counterpart Javier Milei, who called Petro a \"terrorist murderer\" in a yet-to-be-aired interview.\n\nMilei, a staunch anti-communist, was interviewed by journalist Andr\u00e9s Oppenheimer for his weekly television show. While the interview is scheduled to be broadcast by CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on the evening of Sunday, March 31, the television channel has published several preview clips of the interview on its website and on social media.\n\nIn one such clip, Milei describes Petro, a former member of the Marxist M19 guerrilla terrorist organization, as a \"terrorist murderer,\" which drew the immediate ire of the Colombian far-left president.\n\n\"The carnage that is Venezuela is truly unheard of. The same as the island-jail of Cuba,\" Milei said. \"Then, there are other cases that are on the way there, right? Let's say like the case of Colombia with Mr. Petro that, let's say, not much can be expected from someone who was a terrorist murderer, right? A communist.\"\n\nShortly after the clip was published, the Colombian Foreign Ministry released a statement repudiating Milei's words, stressing that \"it is not the first time\" that Milei has offended Petro and \"affected\" the relations between Colombia and Argentina.\n\n\"The expressions of the Argentine president have damaged the confidence of our nation, in addition to offending the dignity of President Petro, who was democratically elected,\" the statement read.\n\n\"In this context, the Government of Colombia orders the expulsion of diplomats from the Argentine embassy in Colombia,\" the statement continued. \"The scope of this decision will be communicated to the Argentine Embassy through diplomatic institutional channels.\"\n\nThe Marxist M19 group, which Petro regularly boasts of having belonged to, was a Colombian guerrilla terrorist group active between 1974 and 1990, when it demobilized and became a small far-left political party that disbanded in 2000. Petro joined the gang at the age of 18.\n\nThe terrorist organization is known to have committed several terrorist attacks. Most notably, M19 was responsible for the 1985 siege of the Palace of Justice in Bogot\u00e1, one of the worst terrorist attacks in Colombian history.\n\nOn that day, roughly 35 M19 members attacked the seat of Colombia's judiciary, holding hundreds of civilians hostage. Nearly a hundred civilians were killed during the siege, including 11 Colombian Supreme Court justices.\n\nM19 was also responsible for the 1980 siege of the Dominican Republic Embassy in Bogot\u00e1, where members of the Marxist guerrilla group held nearly 60 people, including 15 ambassadors, hostage for roughly two months. The hostages were participating in an official gathering marking Dominican Independence Day.\n\nAdditionally, M19 was involved in the abduction and murder of labor leader Jos\u00e9 Raquel Mercado in 1976, the hijacking of a Colombian airliner in 1982, several attacks on villages, and the theft of the swords that belonged to Venezuelan founding father Sim\u00f3n B\u00f3livar from a museum in 1974, as well as numerous other crimes.\n\nLast week, Petro claimed during an official event that M19 had some of its members train with pro-Palestinian terrorist groups in Libya, asserting that the groups had \"the same root\" as M19.\n\n\"We also want to have a homeland. That is why the M-19, in stories not known, was in the deserts of the Sahara and was side by side with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Polisario Front, and the SWAPO,\" Petro said. \"And, although they may not like it, of the African National Congress, which was Nelson Mandela's guerrilla group. The M19 fought with Nelson Mandela for freedom.\"\n\nThe upcoming CNN en Espa\u00f1ol interview marks the second time that Milei has accused Petro of murder. In January, Milei described Petro as \"a communist murderer who is ruining Colombia\" during an interview.\n\nIn August, Petro compared Milei to Adolf Hitler after Milei described socialists as \"garbage\" and \"human excrement\" in remarks given to a Colombian radio station.\n\nPetro was one of the first Latin American Presidents who lamented Milei's landslide victory in the November 2023 presidential runoff election.\n\n\"The extreme right has won in Argentina; it is the decision of its society. Sad for Latin America and we shall see. Neoliberalism no longer has a proposal for society, it cannot respond to the current problems of humanity,\" Petro said at the time.",

        "title": "How Latin American Muslims observe Ramadan amid sadness and",
        "body": "SAO PAULO: Throughout Latin America, Muslim communities are observing Ramadan this year without the atmosphere of festivity that is common during the iftar meal owing to the suffering in Gaza, where more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on Oct. 7.\n\n\"This will be one of the worst Ramadan celebrations for us,\" said Bashar Shakerat, a community leader in an area on the border between Uruguay and Brazil called Little Palestine due to the relatively high concentration of Palestinian immigrants.\n\n\"We're praying at the mosque and there's no festivity later. Everybody is sad.\"\n\nOn Sundays during Ramadan, women traditionally cook large meals and people gather at the social club to celebrate. On weeknights, groups usually gather at home for iftar. Shakerat said nothing like that is happening this year.\n\n\"We just want to pray and stay quiet at home,\" he told Arab News. \"We just want this war to be over. We're tired. We want peace.\"\n\nBorn in the Palestinian city of Jenin, Shakerat said he has family in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as do many of the residents of Little Palestine.\n\n\"We traditionally collect food kits and distribute them among needy families in our city. We know that our brothers and sisters in Palestine are also starving,\" he added.\n\nMuslim communities in Latin America do not have a high number of Palestinians. Even so, the feeling of closeness to Gazans is omnipresent.\n\n\"Our mosque was founded decades ago by Palestinian immigrants. They moved to other cities or died over the years, and now most of our community are Africans or Brazilians,\" Turkish-born Sheikh Adil Pechliye, spiritual leader of Palestine Mosque in the Brazilian city of Criciuma, told Arab News.\n\nDespite the demographic change in the community, the mosque's members still have a deep connection to Palestine, said Pechliye, who graduated in Madinah in 2001.\n\n\"We've joined Criciuma's pro-Palestine committee, and have been active in protests and marches against the genocide in Gaza,\" he added.\n\nPechliye has been giving lectures on Palestine, and gave a Friday sermon in a public square a few weeks ago in order to disseminate information on Gaza.\n\nA couple of months ago, the Muslim community promoted a relief campaign and sent aid to the Palestinian enclave.\n\nPechliye believes that most Brazilians support the Palestinians despite the pro-Israel stance of the Brazilian press.\n\nHe praised President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has been fiercely critical of Israel and even compared what is happening in Gaza to the Holocaust.\n\n\"The Holocaust was undeniably terrible, but I don't think Lula tried to downplay its seriousness. He wanted to emphasize the horror of what's happening now,\" Pechliye said.\n\nIn the city of Santa Ana in El Salvador, the Muslim community also gathers to pray at a mosque named Palestine.\n\nMezquita Palestina Tierra Santa was founded in 2011 by a community that is almost completely made up of converted Salvadorans.\n\n\"We wished to honor Armando Bukele, who introduced Islam to El Salvador and whose family came from Palestine,\" Sheikh Guillermo Sanchez told Arab News.\n\nBukele was born in El Salvador to Christian parents from Palestine, but he converted to Islam and was an imam for several years. His son Nayib is the current president of El Salvador.\n\nSanchez said his community \"has strong ties with Palestine, and has been struggling to support Gazans in every way possible. A few weeks ago, we promoted a campaign to collect donations and sent it to Gaza.\"\n\nIn the Colombian city of Cali, the Muslim community is in constant sorrow for the Palestinians, said Egyptian-born Sheikh Amr Nabil.\n\n\"At night we'll have something to eat with our brothers here, but Gazans won't have anything,\" he told Arab News. \"That's very painful, and at the same time it helps us understand the injustices of our world.\"\n\nSince the beginning of Ramadan, the community in Cali has been praying for the Palestinians, and leaders such as Nabil have been giving lectures about Palestine and the roots of the conflict.\n\n\"I believe that only somebody who is completely uninformed about the Palestinian struggle is capable of supporting the ongoing genocide, or it's a person who has completely lost humanity,\" he said.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has criticized on several occasions Israel's attacks on Gaza. Many Muslims in the South American nation support his stance.\n\n\"His declarations are those of a human being who expressed solidarity to a people that's being massacred. We appreciate it very much,\" Nabil said.\n\nSheikh Abu Yahya, a Mexican-born community leader who converted to Islam 12 years ago, told Arab News this is \"the most difficult Ramadan. Our community in (the city of) Leon is formed by Mexican converts and by Muslims from Arab countries. We're all equally sad.\"\n\nHe said the community has been focusing on \"developing empathy and suffering together with those who are suffering, so prayers for the Palestinians have been constant.\"\n\nAbu Yahya added: \"We decided to take part in the local pro-Palestinian committee. We've been taking part in several activities and sharing information about Palestine.\"\n\nHe said amid pro-Israel campaigns in the Mexican media, many Mexicans do not have adequate information about what is happening in Gaza.\n\n\"That's noticeable during our lectures, but when people discover the reality, they express their solidarity with the Palestinians,\" he added.\n\nMany Latin Americans have been receiving information and images of the victims in Gaza via social media, which has been impacting the perceptions of a growing number of people in the region.\n\n\"The war doesn't spare anyone, and hunger is undoubtedly the worst way of dying. That's why it's impossible not to think about Gazans during Ramadan,\" said Shakerat.",

        "body": "For me, holding a job reduces the drudgery tied to the singularity of the maternal identity. Working with students is the most rewarding form of professional labour, and as I teach, I continue to learn\n\nA sculpture by Mona Saudi from the ongoing exhibition, 'In the eyes of our present, we hear Palestine' at Al Dhaid Clinic in Sharjah by the Sharjah Art Foundation\n\nSince Monday morning, I have been living through the peculiar conundrum of simultaneously missing our toddler yet being surprisingly content with the four-night break I'm on from being called 'mama'. I was a mess on Sunday evening. I held my toddler close and couldn't fathom not sleeping next to him for the first time since his birth. When I count my consciousness of him during the span of my pregnancy, the time of our togetherness feels even longer. And here I am now, finally on the other side of the anxiety. Tomorrow, as you read this column, I will mid-flight, on my way back to Milan. We will be reunited.\n\nI was lucky to be staying with my family in Dubai. It definitely helped to distract myself. Did I check in with my partner or video call my child? No. I have only been sending video dispatches. I felt it was best not to check in on his caretakers -- my partner and my in-laws so that they didn't feel like they needed to report to me. Returning to Dubai to meet my niece and nephew, who are now 15 and 14, was also a good reminder of the fact that these separations are small blips in their trajectories. Neither have any memory from their childhood of being without their mothers. The advice I mentioned last week, about anxiety stemming from lack of trust in people, has held me in good stead. Another calming text I read spoke about how, in the absence of the breastfeeding mother, the child simply will sleep with the father or the alternative caregiver. It is not that they need necessarily to feed to sleep, they need, really, to feel safe and be offered the right environment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo anyone who doesn't have children, it may seem strange to hear me talk about this first-time separation, but it is so bodily, especially when one is breastfeeding. It has something to do with experiencing one's consciousness differently. Also, encountering very different levels of non-tiredness. Last night, for instance, I struggled to fall asleep because I was simply not tired enough. Even though it was midnight and I had spent the last two hours in a shopping mall (the joys of being in Dubai during Ramadan) and had spent the whole day first at the workshop I am co-hosting with the Sharjah Art Foundation at the Africa Institute, then to and back from Al Dhaid, an hour's drive away from Sharjah city to see the Foundation's exhibition of Palestinian art from their collection. Despite all of these intellectual and physical intensities, not taking care of a child leaves the body not quite tired, which, in combination with mild jet lag, meant I didn't fall asleep as I normally would have. I woke up constantly as if my body was even rejecting the rest.\n\nThere is a term used to describe the overwhelming experience of becoming mother. It is called 'matrescence'. It refers to the complexity of suddenly inhabiting a dual consciousness and the very bodily experience of feeling like you are not your previous self anymore. Shopping is an odd thing to do because I don't even know what my 'style' is anymore. I wear baggier jeans and like looser fitting clothes, but the wardrobe from my pre-maternal days feels somewhat alien to me. What I choose to spend my energies on when I am alone with myself has also changed. On my flight, for instance, I felt elated to watch the animated cartoon, Bluey, about a family of dogs living in Brisbane. It thrilled me because it captured so much of the joy and the anguish of parenting.\n\nI think if there is one category of people who are most idealised but who never quite feel seen, it is mothers. Within this there is the category of the stay-at-home and the 'working' mother, both obscenely worded categories, because motherhood in and of itself is exhausting labour. Holding a job at the same time to me feels welcome because it takes me away from the drudgery of the singularity of the maternal identity. Being offered the chance to relate to other people who are not my children reminds me that I have other dimensions to my identity.\n\nOur toddler refers to my work as 'Mama study'. It's perfect because even when I am the one teaching, I continue learning. Working with students -- mostly Gen Z -- is something I have done parallel to holding a full-time job and being a mother, and it is, possibly, the most rewarding form of professional labour. I relish being in the company of these people whose sense of self is still in flux. Because I feel secure about myself and confident in my skills as a lecturer, I allow myself to bask in the feeling of awe I can see being directed towards me. I see their brains lighting up. I see their worlds shifting. I see how this form of labour, like intentional parenting, is another form of feminist activism. It fills my heart with joy and delight and hope. I feel complicit in gently altering the trajectory of the future.",

        "title": "Building A Decent Gaza - Analysis",
        "body": "On Feb. 22, 2024, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented his Security Cabinet with a short document, \"The Day After Hamas.\" His office calls it \"principles reflecting a broad public consensus on the goals of the war, and the civil alternative to the terrorist organization's rule in the Gaza Strip.\" Its key passage states that the Government of Israel plans to work primarily with Gazans to rebuild their territory, secondly with friendly Arab states.\n\n\"Civil affairs and responsibility for public order will be based on local actors with \"management experience\" and not identified with countries or organizations supporting terrorism or receive payments from them; a de-radicalization program will be promoted in all religious, educational, and welfare institutions in the [Gaza] strip with as much as possible the involvement and assistance of Arab countries that have experience in promoting de-radicalization.\"\n\nIn a step toward this program of self-rule, the IDF in late February began an informal pilot program of what it called \"humanitarian pockets.\" Established in parts of north Gaza cleared of Hamas, they consist of local governing bodies of community leaders, including merchants and civil society leaders, whose duties include distributing humanitarian aid and revising school curricula. The process moves slowly. \"We're looking for the right people to step up to the plate,\" an official said. \"But it is clear that this will take time, as no one will come forward if they think Hamas will put a bullet in their head.\"\n\nIt bears noting that the Feb. 22 document does not mention the Palestinian Authority (PA), neither including nor excluding it. More generally, it avoids contentious issues. The New York Timescharacterized it as \"carefully written to postpone long-term decisions about the territory's fate and to avoid irreversible confrontations with both domestic allies and foreign partners.\"\n\nA confidential source informs me the plan relies heavily on a report, \"Building Pillars of Peace: An Option for Gaza,\" an independent analysis submitted to the government in August 2014. That report contains a mechanism for Gazans to run their own affairs through the creation of a Transitional International Presence based on the Oslo Accords. It recommends twelve Sector Working Groups to cover agriculture, education, employment creation, environment, health, infrastructure and housing, institution-building, police, private sector, public finance, tourism, and transport and telecommunications.[1]\n\nThe idea of Israel working with Gazans faces two main criticisms. One prefers to fit Gaza into a larger political context. U.S. President Joe Biden calls for \"a revitalized Palestinian Authority\" (abbreviated as RPA). Accordingly, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby responded coolly to the plan, saying that \"the Palestinian people should have a voice and a vote ... through a revitalized Palestinian Authority.\"\n\nThe PA, naturally, hates the plan. A spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, derided it as \"aimed at continuing Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.\" So does Hamas; Palestinian analyst Mustafa Ibrahim dismissed it as \"a vision solely centered around Israel and its interests, with no regard for the humanity or rights of Palestinians.\"\n\nOthers propose alternative schemes. Mohammed Dahlan, a Gazan politician in exile, foresees a new Palestinian leader of Gaza (himself?) ruling with Arab state support. Yisrael Beytenu party leader Avigdor Liberman believes the Egyptians should take control of Gaza \"as a mandate of the United Nations and the Arab League.\" Natan Sharansky, the democracy advocate, hopes Saudis and Emiratis will help build \"an independent economy, a normal education, normal housing, a civil society.\" Nearly 40 percent of Israelis, including two prominent government ministers, want Jewish settlement of the territory.\n\nThe second criticism accepts that Gaza remain a separate territory but holds that Israel cannot find \"local actors\" to work with. They have several reasons to reject the relative optimism implicit to Netanyahu's plan.\n\nSenior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri derides Israeli efforts to rule Gaza as \"pointless\" and predicts they \"will never succeed.\" Former head of Israel's National Security Council Meir Ben Shabbat agrees, expecting that Hamas \"will clearly continue to be the dominant power in the Gaza Strip.\" The Economist newspaper concludes that Gaza will become \"another of the Middle East's failed states, broken but never rebuilt.\"\n\nThe following analysis supports the Netanyahu plan and its implicit optimism,[3] arguing for what I call a decent Gaza run by decent Gazans.[4] My hope rests on the fact that Gazans have endured something monstrous and possibly unique in human experience over the past fifteen years: exploitation by their rulers as cannon fodder for public relations. This means that, however anti-Zionist they may be, most Gazans despise Hamas and desperately want to move on, even if that means working with the Zionist enemy, and are ready to run a typical Middle East-style police state.\n\nThat \"monstrous and possibly unique experience\" lays the premise for anti-Hamas sentiments. Throughout history, dictators have seen their troops as expendable human drones replaceable with new conscripts. Russia's disregard of its Wagner prison recruits in the Battle of Bakhmut typifies this casual use of cheap manpower. It hardly mattered to Russia's President Vladimir Putin how much of his cannon fodder perished, so long as the front line moved forward. Battlefield gains justified any loss of life.\n\nThen there is Hamas, the jihadi organization that has ruled Gaza since 2007. For seventeen years, it has implemented an opposite and perhaps historically unique purpose: purposefully tormenting its subject population. Rather than sacrifice soldiers for battlefield gains, it sacrifices civilians for public relations purposes.\n\nHamas repeatedly attacks Israel to provoke retaliation, correctly expecting that the destruction and suffering in Gaza will bring support from antisemites and radicals of all persuasions, including Palestinian nationalists, Islamists, far-leftists, far-rightists, and sundry dictatorships. After Hamas attacks and Israel retaliates, blame for the violence quickly shifts from Hamas to Israel, to Hamas' benefit.[5] Perversely, the more misery endured by Gazans, the more convincingly can Hamas accuse Israel of aggression - and the wider and the more vehement its support.\n\nTo ensure that Gazan civilians will be rendered hungry, homeless, injured, and dead, Hamas bases troops and missiles in mosques, churches, schools, hospitals, and private homes. An Emirati political figure, Dirar Belhoul al-Falasi, explained in one case that \"Hamas fired a rocket from the hospital's roof, so that Israel would bomb this hospital.\" Hamas calls on Gazans to serve as human shields. It parks vehicles in the roads to block civilians from moving southwards and out of harm's way. It shoots would-be refugees.\n\nThe U.S. government has noted this pattern of behavior. In 2014, the diplomat Dennis Ross commented that Gazans paid a \"staggering\" price for Hamas' aggression but its leaders \"have never been concerned about that. For them, Palestinians' pain and suffering are tools to exploit, not conditions to end.\" Douglas Feith, a former high-ranking Pentagon official, correctly finds it \"unprecedented for a party to adopt a war strategy to maximize civilian deaths on its own side.\" He dubs this \"not a human shield strategy [but] a human sacrifice strategy.\"\n\nA trove of evidence-polling, demonstrations, and statements-suggests that Gazans understand this Hamas strategy and reject serving as its pawns in an obsessive and illusory jihad.\n\nFor starters, polling makes this evident. Fortunately, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy conducted an extensive poll of Gazans in July 2023. Its findings include:\n\nAn Arab Barometer survey of Gazans completed the day before Oct. 7 confirms these results, finding that\n\n\"Gazans were more likely to blame their material predicament on Hamas's leadership than on Israel's economic blockade. ... Overall, 73 percent of Gazans favored a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On the eve of Hamas's October 7 attack, just 20 percent of Gazans favored a military solution that could result in the destruction of the state of Israel.\"\n\nIts pollsters concluded that,\n\n\"rather than supporting Hamas, the vast majority of Gazans have been frustrated with the armed group's ineffective governance as they endure extreme economic hardship. Most Gazans do not align themselves with Hamas's ideology, either. Unlike Hamas, whose goal is to destroy the Israeli state, the majority of survey respondents favored a two-state solution with an independent Palestine and Israel existing side by side.\"\n\nAmaney Jamal of Princeton University, who participated in the Arab Barometer survey, estimates that 27 percent of Gazans would have voted for Hamas before Oct. 7. Gershon Baskin, a far-left Israeli with many connections in Gaza, agrees: the pre-Oct. 7 support for Hamas was well under 30 percent \"because in Gaza they have experienced 17 years of Hamas rule.\"\n\nAccording to a Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research poll conducted six weeks after Oct. 7, Gazan support for Hamas stands at 42 percent, a slight increase over the 38 percent three months earlier. In other words, the massacre did slightly increase backing for Hamas, but most Gazans reject it.\n\nPolling in Gaza's brutal environment may be vulnerable to manipulation; other manifestations confirm the anti-Hamas sentiment. Public demonstrations offer one vivid example.\n\nA video of hundreds of Gazans evacuated from the north to the south of Gaza shows them chanting \"Down with Hamas.\" Outside Deir al-Balah's Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, displaced northern Gazans demanded that Hamas release Israeli hostages, end the fighting, and make possible their return home. Children held white pieces of paper with \"Yes to giving back the hostages.\" Protesters shouted out:\n\n\"The people want to end the war! We put our trust in Allah, he is our best supporter! We don't want [food] coupons! We want to live! We want to go back home, to Beit Lahia! We want to go back home, to Al-Shati! We want to go back home, to Jabalia!\"\n\nVideos of a demonstration in Rafah show Gazans cursing Hamas and Yahya Sinwar. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Military Intelligence Directorate's Unit 504 has held tens of thousands telephone conversations with Gazans, urging civilians to evacuate combat areas. Along the way, it learns about local resistance to Hamas, as when locals chased Hamas away when it tried to take over their homes.\n\nThe issue of Hamas stealing humanitarian aid provokes high emotions.\n\nFurther reports indicate that \"Some Palestinians are openly challenging the authority of Hamas ... in scenes unimaginable just a month ago.\" Those scenes include:\n\nIn a live televised scene, a passerby disrupted a speech by a Hamas spokesman, brandishing his bandaged hand in the air and shouting \"May God hold you to account, Hamas!\" The much-shared clip of this incident led to Hamas issuing a public threat: \"We warn against publishing any pictures, videos or materials that are offensive to the image of the steadfastness and unity of our people in Gaza.\" To prevent protests, JNS reports, Hamas \"deployed security personnel to refugee centers, schools and other locations.\"\n\nIn all, Maj.-Gen. Rasan Aliyan, who heads the Israel Defense Forces' liaison office with Palestinians, noted \"more and more evidence of public criticism voiced by the residents of Gaza against the Hamas terrorist organization.\"[6]\n\nA survey of the press prompts the Gatestone Institute's Bassam Tawil to conclude that anti-Hamas Gazans \"have been almost completely ignored by mainstream media in the West.\" Arab media likewise \"has made it a habit of ignoring any Palestinian who dares to criticize Hamas.\" Still, dissident views come out.\n\nLive media interviews on Al Jazeera and other Arabic media that go awry inadvertently broadcast hatred of Hamas and its state backers.\n\nThey also publicize their views. An impassioned young Gazan man made an Internet video to criticize Hamas for neglecting the interests of Gaza's population, especially not having planned for the dire consequences of Oct. 7. Israeli intelligence Unit 504 gathers many such opinions about Hamas, such as: \"We're dying and they're saving themselves.\" The \"Voices of Gaza\" project of the Center for Peace Communications (CPC) collected bitter expressions from real-life Gazans.\n\nGazans living abroad can speak frankly, especially on the delicate topic of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the Oct. 7 mastermind. One exile says that Gazans \"were surprised\" by the attack and calls Sinwar \"a fool and a madman. ... We know that Hamas started this war, what Sinwar did was suicidal.\" In all, \"People are very tired of war. It's enough -- how much more? Enough.\" In a video of his interrogation by the Israeli government, Yousef al-Mansi, a former \"communications minister\" for Hamas criticized Sinwar: he \"feels like he is above everyone else\" and has \"delusions of grandeur.\" Further,\n\n\"People in the Gaza Strip say that Sinwar and his group destroyed us, we must get rid of them. ... I have not seen anyone in the Gaza Strip who supports Sinwar; nobody likes Sinwar. There are people who, day and night, pray that God will free us from him.\"\n\nIn all, he says, Hamas \"destroyed the Gaza Strip, set it back 200 years.\" Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Gaza's Al-Azhar University who fled Gaza, reports on \"a lot of criticism among Palestinians that the Oct. 7 attack -- the killing of Israeli civilians, women and children -- was a strategic mistake that provoked Israel into the current war.\" He predicts that. \"Once the war is over, you will hear more and more criticism against Hamas.\" Even a Gazan living in Gaza found the courage to spew venom against Sinwar:\n\n\"I want to convey my message to the Hamas government. May God take revenge on you [and] curse your forefathers. ... May God curse you, O Sinwar, you son of a dog. May God take revenge on you, you've destroyed us. ... Give the [Israeli] prisoners [back to Israel], these dogs who are in your possession. ... Sinwar is underground, hiding together with [Muhammad] Deif and all the other disgusting ones.\"\n\nAnother anti-Sinwar protestor called for a \"revolution of the hungry.\" Eventually whole crowds bellowed complaints against Sinwar and other Hamas leaders, reportedly leading to Hamas forces firing on the demonstrators.\n\nIn all, these many data points point to a solid majority of Gazans wanting liberation from the tyranny of Hamas. While few Gazans accept Israel and most adhere to the concept of \"resistance,\" Joseph Braude of CPC argues, \"a substantial majority oppose Hamas' brand of resistance -- that is, starting wars it can't win while hiding in bunkers and leaving civilians to suffer the consequences.\" Further, \"a large number of Gazans, while opposed to Israel, adopt a pragmatic outlook on cooperation if it delivers tangible benefit to them. These pragmatists, combined with the minority who believe in coexistence as a principle, constitute a solid base of support for any post-Hamas administration committed to reconstruction.\" Together, they \"show that a different, brighter, and more peaceful future is possible.\"\n\nDespite the high-profile pessimism about decent Gaza, this prospect finds solid support. Bassam Tawil finds that while \"many Palestinians continue to support Hamas,\" increasing numbers of them \"deplore what the Hamas terrorists did and who are willing to speak out.\" The CPC reports that its network in Gaza includes \"a critical mass of educators, intellectuals, and activists who oppose Hamas and support systemic change and development. ... The possibility of a brighter future for Gaza hinges on a smart plan to empower these and other Gazans who share the will to reach for it.\" West Bank human rights activist Bassam Eid hopes that \"Israel will very soon free Gaza from Hamas. After the war, the best thing to do is to give Gaza to its own people to rule.\" The clans in each of Gaza's five districts should take charge. \"Let those big tribes start ruling their own cities by themselves. ... Those tribes will provide a very good security to Israel.\"\n\nArab state leaders, one report finds, support a post-war Gaza ruled by \"neither Abbas nor Hamas.\" Abbas was told to stay away, Hamas told that \"Not one dollar will flow as long as you control the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nEven U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken endorsed something along these lines: \"We can't have a reversion to the status quo, with Hamas running Gaza. We also can't have ... Israel running or controlling Gaza. ... In between those ... are a variety of possible permutations that we're looking at very closely now.\" Blinken wants Israel to \"be a partner of the Palestinian leaders who are willing to lead their people and living side by side in peace with Israel.\" U.K Foreign Secretary James Cleverly agrees: \"As soon as practicable, a move towards a peace-loving Palestinian leadership is the most desired outcome\" in Gaza.\n\nMany Israelis are on board. Mordechai Kedar of Bar-Ilan University has long argued for Israel to deal with Palestinian clans. Contrasting the success of the United Arab Emirates, with its seven clans, with disasters in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Sudan, and Libya, he concludes that one clan per government offers \"the best way to establish a state in the Middle East.\" Such states, he finds, seek stability and prosperity, not foes. They have no need for \"an external enemy like Israel in order to galvanize all the groups into one nation.\" Member of Knesset Moshe Saada wants something similar: \"A local mukhtar [village elder] will rule civil life in each area. There will be no central government.\"\n\nShaul Bartal of the BESA Center foresees two stages after Israeli forces seize Gaza: \"a full Israeli military government\" and then \"the integration of local and regional forces, including military forces, into the newly formed government.\" He sees these made up of Palestinian, Egyptian, and other elements. Jonathan Rynhold and Toby Greene of Bar-Ilan University want Israel to plan \"how it can incorporate elements of the existing bureaucracy into a stable post-Hamas political order.\" Glen Segell of Haifa University hopes that \"educated and competent Palestinians\" will establish local committees that \"assume management of utilities such as water, electricity, education, and health together with the IDF.\" Natan Sharansky holds that only a free Palestinian society in which people \"enjoy a normal life, normal freedom, the opportunity to vote and have their own human rights\" can assure Israel's security. A poll found 21 percent of Israelis endorse such a Palestinian government.\n\nAmerican analysts concur. Robert Satloff of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy hopes that \"out of this crisis comes opportunity ... to make in Gaza a reasonably well-functioning administration that puts first the needs of its citizens, and not the ideology of its rulers.\" Former government officials Lewis Libby and Douglas J. Feith note that for the Gazans who oppose Hamas, the coming months will present an opportunity, for the outside world will eagerly assist \"Gazans who take a stand for a new, honest government that respects its people and favors peace through mutual compromise with Israel.\" Jeff Jacoby, a Boston Globe columnist, sees an Israeli administration \"explicitly committed to nourishing a healthy civil society\" as the best path to \"effective and peaceful self-rule.\"\n\nIsrael can reasonably expect to find a substantial cohort of Gazans ready to work with it to establish a new authority in Gaza that begins to return them to normal life. These Gazans will take on a wide range of tasks: policing, utilities, municipal services, administration, communications, teaching, urban planning, and so on.\n\nWhile this may sound like wishful thinking, it bears recalling that Gazans not that long ago led decent lives under Israeli rule. Gaza and the West Bank in the 1970s, recounts historian Efraim Karsh, \"constituted the fourth fastest-growing economy in the world -- ahead of such 'wonders' as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Korea, and substantially ahead of Israel itself.\" Medicine, electricity, schools, literacy -- all flourished. Gazans benefited from refrigerators, clean running water, and much else. Gazans are not immune to the charms of normal life.\n\nUnfortunately, Israel failed to cultivate relations with relatively friendly Gazans and lacked decent Gazan partners in its first period of rule, 1967-2005. Then, in an act of historic stupidity, it handed the territory to the genocidal Yasir Arafat. In a further mistake, it not only permitted the even more horrific Hamas to control Gaza after 2007 but encouraged external funders such as Qatar.\n\nCall the new entity the Revitalized Palestinian Authority if you like, but it must have no connection whatsoever to the execrable Palestinian Authority that rules parts of the West Bank. Nor should Arab or international bodies take part in its administration.\n\nDecent Gaza means tough Israeli military rule overseeing a tough police state along the lines of what exists in Egypt and Jordan, countries where one can lead a normal life so long as one stays out of trouble and never, ever criticizes the ruler. Gaza can become decent, not at war with its neighbor and economically viable. Will Israelis have the acumen and stamina to make this happen? Can they retrieve something positive out of tragedy?\n\nAbout the author: Daniel Pipes (DanielPipes.org, @DanielPipes) is president of the Middle East Forum and author of, most recently, Islamism vs. The West: 35 Years of Geopolitical Struggle (Wicked Son, 2023). \u00a9 2024 by Daniel Pipes.

Corsight's complicity isn't seen as an urgent matter.\n\nNor, for that matter, do most of these politicians give sufficient attention to Israel's genocidal policies in Gaza.\n\nUnmentioned by the Times is that Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli major general, serves on the board of directors of Corsight.\n\nWhen Eiland joined the board in January 2021, Igal Raichelgauz, chairman and founder of the Cortica Group, stated, \"We are excited to add Giora to the company board, we believe that due to his extensive experience in the national security field, Corsight will continue growing into new markets and territories and lead the face recognition market in Israel and in the world.\" Corsight is a subsidiary of Cortica, a firm focused on artificial intelligence.\n\nEiland is a proponent of the ethnic cleansing of the occupied territory of Gaza.\n\nHe wrote for the Israeli publication Ynet on 12 October that \"One option is a massive and complex ground operation, with no regard to duration and cost, while the second option is to create conditions where life in Gaza becomes unsustainable.\"\n\nIn fact, Israel has done both.\n\nEiland noted, without voicing dissent, that \"Israel has already begun suspending the supply of diesel, fuel, electricity and water, as well as closing the border crossings. Yet, it remains uncertain whether these measures are enough.\"\n\nHe then moved to ethnic cleansing.\n\n\"Israel issued a stern warning to Egypt and made it clear that it would not permit humanitarian aid from Egypt to enter Gaza. Israel needs to create a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, compelling tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in Egypt or the Gulf.\"\n\nHe said nothing of wanting such an arrangement to be temporary.\n\nEiland then jumped beyond an ethnic cleansing of \"tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands.\" He wrote: \"The entire population of Gaza will either move to Egypt or move to the Gulf.\"\n\nThe retired general also recommended targeting civilian vehicles in Gaza.\n\n\"Every vehicle in Gaza is considered a military vehicle transporting combatants. Therefore, there is no vehicular traffic, and it does not matter whether it is transporting water or other critical supplies.\"\n\nSuch rhetoric amounts to abetting war crimes and has had real consequences for Palestinian children such as 6-year-old Hind Rajab who, according to the Palestine Red Crescent, the Israeli military killed earlier this year in a car along with other family members.\n\nEiland pushed collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza as well.\n\n\"The UN secretary-general has initiated humanitarian aid to Gaza. The Israeli condition for any aid should be a visit by the Red Cross to Israeli hostages and especially the civilians among them. Until this happens, no aid of any kind will be permitted to enter into Gaza.\"\n\nHinting at the overwhelming violence to come against Palestinian civilians, Eiland wrote of the developing Israeli attack: \"It is comparable to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which led to the launch of an atomic bomb in Japan.\"\n\nThe Israeli military has killed over 32,000 Palestinians in Gaza since 7 October, including more than 13,000 children. The International Court of Justice deems it plausible that Israel is engaged in genocidal actions in the small coastal territory.\n\nEiland wrapped up his opinion piece by declaring, \"As a result, Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist, and I say this as a means rather than an end. I say this because there is no other option for ensuring the security of the state of Israel. We are fighting an existential war.\"\n\nThis goes beyond ethnic cleansing to genocide talk when speaking of \"a place where no human being can exist.\"\n\nHe cited a column Eiland wrote in the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. The Brown University professor quoted Eiland as writing, \"The state of Israel has no choice but to turn Gaza into a place that is temporarily or permanently impossible to live in.\"\n\nBartov also quoted Eiland for maintaining, \"Creating a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a necessary means to achieving the goal.\"\n\nThen he cited the same Ynet quote noted above that \"Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist.\"\n\nBartov commented, \"Apparently, no army representative or politician denounced this statement.\"\n\nEiland continued with the genocidal talk in November when he wrote, \"The international community warns of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and of severe epidemics. We must not shy away from it, as hard as it is. After all, severe epidemics in the south of the Strip will hasten victory.\"\n\nOf course, Democratic Majority for Israel received scant attention when it came to light that its board member Archie Gottesman once issued her own genocidal call against Palestinians in Gaza when she tweeted: \"Gaza is full of monsters. Time to burn the whole place.\"\n\nEthnic cleansing and genocide against Palestinians don't properly register with most western politicians who, of course, are providing weapons to Israel to carry out the devastation in Gaza.\n\nThat Corsight carries out \"global operations and support in the US, UK, Singapore, Australia, and R&D in Israel\" with the backing of a board member proponent of ethnic cleansing and genocide will not be a significant concern in Washington.\n\nPopular concern, however, may prove to be a different matter.",

        "title": "Chinese cranes not 'Trojan horses'",
        "body": "The Chinese leader emphasized on Wednesday that China's economy is healthy and sustainable, and that China will consistently improve its business environment to provide broader development space for enterprises from various countries, including the United States.\n\nAt the Nov 2023 summit in San Francisco, US President Joe Biden assured the Chinese side that the United States does not seek to suppress China's development or disengage from it, and instead it is willing to sustain bilateral economic and trade relations. But the US administration has failed to honor this pledge, repeatedly using national security as a pretext to discriminate against, rather hound out, Chinese companies.\n\nOn Feb 21, Biden signed an executive order claiming Chinese-manufactured cranes used in US ports posed a threat to national security. The US administration plans to invest $20 billion over the next five years to upgrade US ports, including replacing Chinese cranes with those produced by a US subsidiary of Japan's Mitsui.\n\nCurrently, 80 percent of the cranes used in US ports are made by Chinese companies, which are known to produce affordable and high-quality products. Allegations that the Chinese-made cranes have been fitted with remote control devices and thus pose a \"national security risk\" are baseless, especially because there is no evidence to prove such allegations. In fact, the US Coast Guard Cyber Command inspected 92 Chinese-made port cranes but has not shown any evidence of the cranes being fitted with illegal or suspicious devices.\n\nIn reality, the executive order aims to \"reshore\" manufacturing to the US. But by trying to revive US manufacturing by suppressing Chinese companies, the US president is going back on his promise.\n\nBesides, in February, Biden ordered the US Department of Commerce to investigate Chinese-made cars, alleging that their software could collect sensitive information on US citizens or remotely control vehicles.\n\nSuch national security trope has nothing to do with reality. Few cars used in the US are made in China, and their software is primarily developed by Western companies such as Bosch and Harman. Gaining access to data from car cameras and sensors, let alone remotely controlling vehicles, would be extremely challenging. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's remarks on MSNBC, suggesting that Beijing could remotely turn off 3 million Chinese-made cars in the US is incredible and irresponsible and groundless.\n\nNational security pretext used by the US is aimed at preventing Chinese electric vehicles from entering the US market and protecting US automakers against potential failure in their competition with Chinese companies.\n\nAs Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in January, Chinese automakers will \"demolish \"global rivals without trade barriers. Faced with intense competition from Chinese automakers, the US government has resorted to using excuses such as \"national security\" to suppress them.\n\nMoreover, on March 13, the US House of Representatives passed a bill by a 352-65 vote, which is aimed at banning the video-sharing app TikTok in the US, or forcing its parent Chinese company to sell its US operations to an American company.\n\nBut this reasoning is baseless. About 60 percent of TikTok's shares are held by global investors, three Americans are on its five-person board, and TikTok already stores US user data on servers operated by Oracle. Also, and strangely enough, some US lawmakers, referring to the Israel-Palestine conflict, allege TikTok videos are biased toward Hamas and have anti-Semitic content. What they refuse to understand or realize is that the videos don't reflect TikTok's policy or intention; instead, they reflect the different views of young US users who don't necessarily think like US politicians.\n\nMany in the US oppose the government's use of national security as a pretext to target TikTok. They see the bill as being purpose-driven and in violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution. A recent survey by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed only 31 percent of US adults support a ban on TikTok, while 35 percent oppose it. Former US president Donald Trump, too, opposes any ban because, he said, it would benefit TikTok's competitor, Facebook. Jim Himes, Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, also opposes the bill, arguing against government censorship of newspapers, broadcasters and social media platforms.\n\nThe US administration's suppression of Chinese companies using national security as an excuse is nothing new. Since 2017, the US has been calling China the US' main \"rival\" and Sino-US ties as \"strategic competition\", abandoning the previous policy of \"engagement\" with China.\n\nEmphasizing strategic competition and downplaying economic engagement have led the US administration to prioritize security over economic considerations in its China policy. The US has been increasingly securitizing economic issues, asserting that Sino-US economic interdependence threatens national security and pushing for \"decoupling\" or \"de-risking\" with China.\n\nThe US administration's use of national security harms not only China's legitimate interests but also overall Sino-US relations. The Chinese government has always opposed the US administration's abuse of power to obstruct normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US. Using \"national security\" as an excuse for trade protectionism will weaken the international competitiveness of US businesses and increase costs for US consumers.\n\nThe author is a research associate at the Institute of American Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.",

        "title": "Op-Ed: UH is trying to suppress pro-Palestine activism - The Cougar",
        "body": "Editor's Note: This article was written by several representatives of the University of Houston's Students for Justice in Palestine chapter.\n\nLast week, students took to the sidewalks to express their discontentment with the University of Houston's complicity in the genocide on Gaza. In front of M.D. Anderson Library, the sidewalks were covered with chalk messages calling for an end to the occupation of Palestine and demanding action from the University. As students began to write out their messages, others stopped to read, and still others put down their bags to join them.\n\nThe students made their demands of the University visible and unavoidable. These demands included the removal of companies like Sabra, Starbucks and McDonald's from campus and the divestment from weapons manufacturers. These companies funded two Israeli military brigades, sued their union after it tweeted a message in support of Palestine and gave free meals to the Israeli military after the start of the aggression.\n\nSince 2016, the University has invested over $7.6 million in weapons manufacturers like Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Electric. In 2023, the University invested in companies like Delek Group and Primo Water that facilitate the extraction of resources like oil and water from the occupied West Bank and Golan Heights.\n\nThrough these investments and contracts, the University of Houston is not only complicit in the occupation and apartheid of Palestine but profiting from it as well. We understand that as students at the University of Houston, it is our responsibility to hold our University accountable for its complicity in occupation, apartheid and genocide.\n\nWhether we are political organizations, student athletic clubs, cultural associations or academic clubs, our silence allows for the University to continue its harmful investments. And it is together, through a joint coalition, that our voice in opposition can end them.\n\nThe growing sentiment in favor of boycotting and divesting from companies' complicity in arming the genocidal assault on Palestine was clearly expressed through the chalking this past week. Chalking not only expressed the discontent of the students participating, but it also educated many others about the activities of the University in its complicity in genocide.\n\nThis unconventional form of grassroots education was immediately successful. That success could be measured through the University washing off the messages at the end of each day. When washing off the chalk did not deter students, the University sent an email on Tuesday afternoon to student organizations explicitly banning the use of chalk and threatening suspension for organizations that do.\n\nThough this threat of suspension is a clear suppression of speech and targeted at the organization, Students for Justice in Palestine that was tabling those days, the threat is also a measure of success. This threat of suspension was targeted at SJP. SJP is the most involved organization advocating for the boycott and divestment that the chalk messages related to.\n\nMany students testified to witnessing chalk used to advertise for events like farmer's markets and hosting Ann Coulter, a conservative political commentator. It was not until chalk was used to spread the message about the University's role in genocide that an email banning chalk messaging was sent. Though this email threatened suspension and acts to repress student demands, it shows the success of the students at making their demands visible.\n\nWe understand that the University will increase its repression tactics as the movement for boycott and divestment becomes more popular and visible. Repression and fear are tools that the University uses to prevent having to take action on the popular demands of the student body and discourage the growth of the movement. However, the students will not give in to the fear and repression tactics deployed by the University.\n\nAnd it is not just SJP that supports the call for boycott and divestment. A coalition is in the midst of being formed to endorse these demands. The students will not be silent or silenced. The movement is growing and getting louder. Though banned from chalking, under the threat of suspension, our struggle continues.\n\nWe will continue to call for boycott and divestment until our demands are met. We will educate not only the students but all of Houston about the University's complicity in genocide. To other organizations, join us in our call for boycott and divestment through joining the coalition endorsing these demands. To the students, come to the event hosted by the coalition on April 18 to learn about the history of boycott and divestment. Participate in the Q&A to hear from the student organizations for why they joined the coalition.",

        "body": "\"At any point, Hamas could have ended this burgeoning tragedy to\n\nsurrender and release every hostage. ...\n\nHamas instigated and owns this humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA)\n\nIsrael deployed a large-scale facial recognition tracking program in the Gaza Strip and created a database of Palestinians without their knowledge or consent, according to The Verge, citing a New York Times report. The program, which was created after the October 7 attacks, uses technology from Google Photos , as well as a custom tool designed by Tel Aviv-based Corsight to identify people affiliated with Hamas. The facial recognition program was created in conjunction with the Israeli military offensive in Gaza, according to a New York Times report.\n\nAfter the October 7 attacks, officers in the IDF's Unit 8200, the IDF's main intelligence unit, identified potential targets by watching security camera footage and videos that Hamas had uploaded to social media. The soldiers also asked the Palestinian prisoners to identify people from their communities who belong to Hamas. Corsight, which boasted that its technology could accurately identify people even if less than 50% of their faces were visible, used these images to build a facial recognition tool that Israeli officers could use in Gaza. In order to further build its database - and identify potential targets - the Israeli army set up checkpoints equipped with facial recognition cameras along the main routes Palestinians use to flee south.\n\nOne officer told the New York Times that the goal was to create a \"hit list\" of people who participated in the October 7 attack. Troopers told the New York Times that Corsight's technology was not always accurate, especially when it relied on grainy footage or images in which people's faces were obscured. In some cases, Corsight mistakenly identified people as being linked to Hamas. One such case involves the Palestinian poet Musab Abu Toha, who was picked up from an Israeli military checkpoint on the central highway in Gaza in mid-November while trying to leave Gaza for Egypt with his family. The IDF had marked Abu Toha as being on the Israeli list of wanted persons. Israeli officers held Abu Toha in a detention center, where he was beaten and interrogated for two days before being returned to Gaza without explanation.\n\nThe Israeli army has integrated Corsight's technology with Google Images - which, unlike Corsight, is free to use - the soldiers said in the newspaper's report. Intelligence officers uploaded databases of \"known persons\" to Google Images and used the image search function to further identify the people. One of the officers said in the report that Google Photos can recognize people even when only a small portion of their faces are visible, making it better than other tools, including Corsight. Corsight executives and financiers have expressed a desire to assist the Israeli military in its ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn an op-ed for The Jerusalem Post last October, Aaron Ashkenazi, founder and managing partner of Canadian fund Awz Ventures, which led a $5 million Corsight funding round in 2020, wrote that Awz was providing Israel with \"technological tools.\" To stop these terrorist attacks.\" Most of the companies in OZ's portfolio operate in the artificial intelligence and cybersecurity sectors. Last October, some hospitals in Israel began using CorSight's technology to identify patients, Forbes reported at the time.\n\nAccording to a Forbes report, Corsight's technology was able to take photos of people \"whose features have been affected by physical trauma, and find a match between photos sent by the relevant family members.\" Corsight focuses on selling its products to government, law enforcement, and military uses, according to The Verge. The company said in 2020 that its technology could recognize masked faces. Two years later, Corsight claimed to be developing a tool that could create a model of a person's face based on their DNA. Last year, Corsight worked with the Metropolitan Police in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, to track down suspects in murders and robberies on the public transportation system, according to The Verge.\n\nIsraeli N12 TV News reprted the head of the Mossad, Dedi Barnea, informed the cabinet that, despite Hamas' answer, there is a possibility of progress - but the price is flexibility regarding the return of residents to the northern Gaza Strip. Barnea explained that it is necessary and possible to think of a creative solution, and this effort is worth the chance of getting 40 hostages out alive. The position of the head of the Mossad was supported by ministers Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, along with minister Ron Dermer. In front of them, in an intermediate position, are Defense Minister Yoav Galant and Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi who claim that this is not the time to be flexible - we should advance to Rafah but not announce it publicly, in order to allow another American effort to promote negotiations and give a chance for a deal.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with an extreme position - according to him, the members of the cabinet do not know how to conduct tough negotiations. Therefore, Netanyahu did not accept the position of head of the Mossad in Barnae and ordered to prepare to enter Rafah - and to announce this publicly. Netanyahu also informed his members The cabinet because contrary to what was published - it intends to send a delegation to the White House as early as next week. A political official told News 12: \"We have to honestly tell the public - not to submit an Israeli proposal at this time, is to bury the abductees deal for a long time.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration officials are holding preliminary \"talks\" about options for stabilizing Gaza after the war, including a proposal that the Pentagon help fund a multinational force or Palestinian peacekeeping team, according to Politico magazine. The magazine reported that the options being considered will not include American forces on the ground, according to two officials from the Ministry of Defense and two other American officials, all of whom requested anonymity. Instead, Defense Department funding will go toward the needs of security forces and supplement assistance from other countries.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from the magazine, a senior US administration official said, \"We are working with partners on different scenarios for interim governance and security structures in Gaza once the crisis subsides,\" refusing to reveal details. \"We have had a number of conversations with both the Israelis and our partners about the key elements for the next day in Gaza when the time comes,\" he added.\n\nIt may be weeks or months before Washington and its partners agree to any plan, especially since regional players want to see a commitment to a two-state solution before seriously engaging in options. There are also questions about the feasibility of training a potential Palestinian-led force in time to maintain order in Gaza, which has been devastated after five months of brutal fighting. Israel is reluctant to hold these talks until it defeats Hamas militarily and secures the release of hostages held by the movement. Some officials within the Israeli government have called for Israel to occupy Gaza after the war, a proposal opposed by the United States.\n\nThe four officials confirmed to the magazine that the talks include the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department and their foreign counterparts about what a potential post-war security force would look like. Under initial plans being developed, the Defense Department would provide funding for a type of security force that would not include U.S. troops on the ground in Gaza, according to Defense Department officials.\n\nOne official added that the aid could be used for reconstruction, infrastructure, humanitarian aid and other needs. The Strip has turned into rubble, and the vast majority of its population of 2.2 million people are displaced due to difficulty accessing food, water and medicine. The Pentagon will likely need to transfer money from elsewhere in the department to pay for the plan. US aid would complement contributions from other countries, according to US officials. As for a potential Palestinian-led peacekeeping team, it remains unclear who will train and equip its members, which could include some of the approximately 20,000 security personnel supported by the Palestinian Authority.\n\nSpokesmen for the Defense Ministry and the Israeli government did not immediately respond to POLITICO's requests for comment.\n\nThe Pentagon began considering options to support some sort of multinational force to stabilize Gaza in the new year, when there were expectations that Israel might soon begin winding down its operations, according to the Defense Department official. Then in January, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel to work with regional countries and moderate Palestinians to rebuild, stabilize and govern Gaza once the war ends. \"This can only come through a regional approach that includes a path to a Palestinian state,\" he said during a visit to Israel. Although American officials have held talks with regional partners about what the composition of such a force would look like, none of them have confirmed participation. Because the plan has not been finalized.\n\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have told the Biden administration that they will only consider participating when there is a serious plan for a two-state solution. \"Although we had conversations on the sidelines with regional partners about what they would be willing to do, contribute to, and accept, this did not receive serious attention from our Israeli partner,\" the official said. The official added that Israel \"does not set a date for the end of its operations because it has not yet achieved the goals it seeks\" in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department is focused on increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including ensuring the security of the US military's plan to build a pier to deliver resources by sea to the Strip, and urging Israel to consider \"alternatives\" to invading Rafah,\" the Defense Department official said. The official added that what comes after the talks also includes the possibility of a two-state solution.\n\nThe Telegraph newspaper quoted an Israeli intelligence source as saying that Tel Aviv believed in the possibility of eliminating the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) due to Washington's support, but this has changed now. He added that the Israeli army believes that some of Hamas's underground weapons production facilities in Gaza are still intact. He stated that the failure of the Israeli army to enter Rafah in force means that Hamas' survival is the most likely possibility, as he put it.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted sources in the Israeli army as saying that there are currently no indications that the army will be able to rescue more prisoners, or kill more Hamas leaders. The sources added that Hamas can still easily return to the areas that the army had previously controlled, in the absence of a stable plan for managing Gaza after the war. Since last October 7, the Israeli army has been waging a devastating war on Gaza that has left tens of thousands of martyrs and wounded, most of them children and women, according to Palestinian sources, which necessitated the trial of Tel Aviv before the International Court of Justice on the grounds of committing genocide.\n\nIsraeli Channel 12 said that the army began preparations to launch an operation in Rafah in the event of the collapse of prisoner negotiations, while Washington asked Tel Aviv to allow the arrival of American officers to participate in developing plans regarding the invasion operation. Channel 12 indicated that the Israeli army has taken actual steps, including beginning to isolate the city and preparing to evacuate civilians. The channel added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the purchase of 40,000 tents from China to set up in Gaza in preparation for the ground operation in Rafah.\n\nIsraeli Channel 13 said that the administration of US President Joe Biden recently asked Israel to allow the arrival of American officers, to make plans regarding Rafah with Israeli army officers. The channel added that American officers are expected to arrive soon, and quoted a senior Israeli official that the United States sending officers to discuss the operation in Rafah is an indication of lack of trust.\n\nMeanwhile, Netanyahu said during his meeting with members of Congress that the northern Gaza Strip has many places where civilians can go during the army's operation in Rafah. The Israeli Prime Minister added, \"We are told that you cannot enter Rafah. If you do, there will be a humanitarian catastrophe and many deaths will occur. This is not true.\" He continued, \"There are many places in the north of the Strip that people can move to. If they were moved to the south, now they can return to the north. They can return with their tents.\"\n\nIn this context, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said that Netanyahu's office agreed to reschedule the Israeli delegation's visit to Washington to discuss the possible military operation in Rafah. Jean-Pierre added that the White House is working with the Israeli side to set a date for the upcoming meeting, \"and this is a good thing.\" She explained that constructive talks were held with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant during the past two days, noting that the Rafah issue was one of the topics discussed.\n\nThe US State Department had confirmed that it had ideas about alternatives to the military operation in Rafah that could lead to the elimination of Hamas brigades there, she said. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday in response to a question from reporters whether a limited military operation in Rafah could eliminate the remaining Hamas leaders, Miller said, \"Yes.\" Regarding the prisoner exchange negotiations, Miller said that Washington still believes that the negotiations on a humanitarian truce in Gaza have not ended and have not reached a dead end, adding that Washington believes that there is a possibility of continuing prisoner release talks with Hamas.\n\nChannel 12 indicated that the Israeli army has taken actual steps, including beginning to isolate the city and preparing to evacuate civilians. The channel added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the purchase of 40,000 tents from China to set up in Gaza in preparation for the ground operation in Rafah. Meanwhile, Israeli Channel 13 said that the administration of US President Joe Biden recently asked Israel to allow the arrival of American officers, to make plans regarding Rafah with Israeli army officers. The channel added that American officers are expected to arrive soon, and quoted a senior Israeli official that the United States sending officers to discuss the operation in Rafah is an indication of lack of trust.\n\nA report by the American newspaper \"The Wall Street Journal\" revealed that the meetings held during the past two days between the Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, and senior officials in the White House and the Pentagon, \"did not focus on how to prevent\" the planned Israeli military operation in Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip. Rather, it is to \"protect civilians as the operation begins.\" The newspaper pointed out that the talks \"came in contrast to the American tone during the past weeks,\" as senior officials explicitly warned Israel against launching a comprehensive operation against Rafah, to which more than a million people were displaced with the start of Israeli military operations in the Strip.\n\nOn Tuesday, during his meeting with Gallant, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that \"protecting Palestinian civilians\" during the war between Israel and Hamas is a \"moral and strategic necessity,\" adding that the situation in the besieged Gaza Strip is \"a humanitarian catastrophe that is worsening.\" US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday that protecting Palestinian civilians during the war between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) is a moral and strategic necessity, adding that the situation in the besieged Gaza Strip is a humanitarian catastrophe that is worsening.\n\nAustin added: \"In Gaza today, the number of civilian casualties is very high and the volume of humanitarian aid is very low... Gaza is suffering a humanitarian catastrophe and the situation is getting worse,\" using his harshest language since the beginning of the crisis. Following the meeting, the Pentagon said that Austin had a \"frank and direct\" discussion with Gallant. Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the Israeli Defense Minister also met for the second day with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who informed Gallant that Israel \"needs to allow an increase in the flow of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that dealing with Rafah has long been at the heart of the growing dispute between the United States and Israel, which escalated with the United States not using its veto, Monday, to stop a UN Security Council resolution \"for an immediate ceasefire and the release of... \"All hostages immediately and unconditionally\" in Gaza. The newspaper quoted a prominent American defense official as saying that there is a \"sequence... where the military aspect should not continue until the humanitarian aspects are fully addressed.\"\n\nThe two parties agreed on \"the necessity of expelling Hamas from Rafah, so that its members cannot return or continue to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip, which is a basic condition for ending the war and paving the way towards a new political authority in Gaza, which means trying to find ways to work with Israel on a strategy in Rafah.\" \"In light of the lack of other options,\" according to the newspaper. She also explained that the two sides \"discussed ways to confront the smuggling of weapons across the Egyptian border into Gaza,\" which Israel considers a source of concern, in addition to \"the precise targeting of Hamas leaders.\"\n\nUS Department of Defense officials explained to the newspaper that the plans \"still have a long way to go before they are formalized, and any convincing plan to transfer civilians from Rafah may take a month.\" The Wall Street Journal also confirmed that the talks this week were strikingly \"different\" compared to what happened last week, when Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the Israelis that a major ground operation risked \"further isolation of Israel around the world.\"\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris also warned Israel that it may face \"consequences\" if it carries out its threat to launch a ground military operation in Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip. Harris said in an interview with the American network ABC, part of which was broadcast on Sunday: \"I do not rule out that there will be American consequences for Israel if it continues to storm Rafah militarily.\" She continued: \"We made clear to Israel in every way, and in several conversations, that any major military operation in Rafah would be a big mistake.\"\n\nIDF and Shin Bet forces continue targeted fighting in the area of Shifa' hospital. The combat teams of the 401st Brigade, the Nahal Brigade and the 13th Fleet under the command of the 162nd Division are fighting in the area while avoiding harm to civilians, patients, medical teams and medical equipment. From the beginning of the activity in the Shifa area until now, about 200 terrorists had been eliminated in the hospital area.\n\nIn the last day, terrorists came out of the emergency room at Shifa' hospital and opened fire at the forces operating in the hospital area, this is in addition to the shooting that was carried out at the IDF forces from the emergency room in the last few days. During the operation, the forces evacuated shelters, patients and medical teams to alternative medical complexes that the IDF prepared and established in order to allow proper medical treatment to continue.\n\nThe forces of the 98th Division continue to operate in Khan Yunis in the Al Amal area and Al Karara, so far the forces have eliminated dozens of terrorists in the operation in the Al Amal area.

Thabet served as the head of the supply and personnel corps of the military arm of Hamas.\"\n\n\"In the past, he served as the head of Hamas's production system, he is a center of knowledge for the organization in all things related to equipping and ammunition,\" he continued, \"Ra'ad was in the top ten of the senior military wing. He is close to Sinwar, Def and Issa.\"\n\n\"He was killed during his escape attempt along with two other terrorists into the hospital plaza,\" he concluded, \"which was also in the plan of an attack on our forces. He was killed by the fighters of the 13th Fleet along with other forces in the area of the Nahal patrol, Shaked, and Dovdvan , along with two other terrorists.\"\n\nAl Jazeera's correspondent reported that dozens were martyred and injured as the Israeli bombing continued on the north and south of the Gaza Strip , while Israeli Channel 12 said that the army had begun preparations to launch an operation in Rafah in the event that prisoner negotiations collapse. An Al Jazeera correspondent said that an Israeli bombing targeted a house on Al-Beltaji Street in the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood , east of Gaza City, leaving 3 martyrs and wounding 20 others. The reporter confirmed that there were casualties as a result of an Israeli raid that targeted the vicinity of Al-Qassam Mosque in the Beit Lahia project in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\nA citizen was also martyred by Israeli occupation army gunfire in Hamad Town, north of Khan Yunis , south of the Gaza Strip. Al Jazeera's correspondent said that the Israeli occupation launched raids targeting the city of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, and other areas north of the Gaza Strip, and another raid targeted the town of Al-Mughraqa, north of Al-Nuseirat, in the center of the Gaza Strip. The reporter pointed out that an Israeli bombing targeted residential buildings in the Al-Rimal neighborhood in central Gaza City .\n\nDuring the night hours, the occupation forces launched an air strike on Al-Shati camp, west of Gaza City. The occupation also launched an air strike on an electrical appliances center in the center of Jabalia camp, which led to a fire breaking out at the site. He added that Israeli military vehicles were firing in the vicinity of Al-Shifa Medical Complex, west of Gaza City, coinciding with artillery shelling.\n\nOn the other hand, the Israeli occupation army announced that one soldier was killed and another was seriously injured in a clash in the southern Gaza Strip yesterday evening, Wednesday. This comes as clashes continue between the resistance factions and the occupation forces in the vicinity of the Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza City, which has been besieged by the occupation for 11 days, while the Israeli army announced that 22 soldiers were injured in Gaza during the past 24 hours.\n\nThe Al-Qassam Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) - announced that its fighters were able to snipe an Israeli soldier in the vicinity of Al-Shifa Medical Complex. For its part, the Al- Quds Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement - said that it bombed gatherings of occupation soldiers in the vicinity of the Al-Shifa Complex with 60 mm mortar shells. The Al-Quds Brigades published scenes of the clashes and targeting of the Israeli military vehicle in the vicinity of the Al-Shifa Complex.\n\nThe HAMAS government media office in Gaza said that the information available to it indicates that Israeli occupation soldiers executed more than 200 displaced Palestinians inside the Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza City, and arrested about a thousand others. He confirmed that the occupation soldiers are threatening the medical teams and the displaced people inside the complex by bombing and destroying the buildings above their heads, or going out for investigation, torture, or execution.\n\nDirector of the HAMAS Government Information Office in Gaza, Ismail Al-Thawabta, said that the Israeli occupation is still controlling and occupying the Shifa complex, killing Palestinians, destroying the homes surrounding it, arresting hundreds of sick, wounded, and displaced people, and interrogating, torturing, and starving them. Al-Thawabta stated that the Israeli forces executed 5 doctors and two nurses, and detained a number of other medical staff. He pointed out that the Israeli army combed residential squares in the vicinity of the hospital, and also destroyed and bombed dozens of homes, completely demolishing them, and committed massacres inside the complex against the displaced and detainees.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the West Bank has witnessed a security escalation and incursions by the occupation army since the start of the war on the Gaza Strip on the seventh of last October, which was met with operations launched by members of the Palestinian resistance factions, which caused the death and injury of Israeli soldiers and settlers.\n\nAt least three Israelis were injured by fire fired at a settler bus and several vehicles near the town of Al-Auja, north of the city of Jericho in the Jordan Valley, on Thursday morning. The Israeli army said that its forces arrived at the scene, closed the area, and began combing operations in search of the attackers who fled. An Israeli ambulance spokesman reported that the shooting occurred in two close locations in the same area, where the attackers also targeted Israeli cars.\n\nIsraeli Army Radio said that the shooting in the Jordan Valley resulted in three people being seriously, moderately, and slightly injured. Shortly after the shooting, the Israeli occupation army closed the entrances to the city of Jericho and began combing the area. Eyewitnesses reported that the occupation army deployed its forces in the area, closed all entrances to the city with military barriers, and prevented the movement of citizens to and from it, and also prevented movement on main streets in the Jordan Valley.\n\nEyewitnesses said that Israeli drones were roaming the skies of the region. The Israeli authorities also announced the closure of the King Hussein Bridge - also known as the Karama crossing - on the border with Jordan after the operation.\n\nTonight, the security forces arrested 18 wanted persons throughout Judea and Samaria. \"This morning in the early hours,\" explained the commander of the Dokifat Battalion, Lt. Col. Sahar Moedim, \"a terrorist opened fire on several vehicles and wounded several Israeli civilians. From that moment, the battalion, the forces of the Bekaa Brigade and special forces, we all jumped to carry out scans in the area. We are here, and we will continue to be until we find the terrorist, until we locate him and neutralize him.\"\n\nThe combat team of the commando formation raided from several directions on the heart of the Al Amal neighborhood in Khan Yunis; The forces located hundreds of weapons in the neighborhood. A suspect arrived by car at the Bekaa crossing near the village of Taysir. After refusing to be checked by the soldiers who were there, the suspect broke through the barrier. IDF forces started chasing him and arrested him. There were no casualties to Israeli forces and the suspect was handed over to the security forces for further treatment.\n\nToday (Thursday) an exercise was carried out in a surprise format. The purpose of the exercise was to strengthen the IDF's readiness for various scenarios in the northern arena. The multi-armed exercise was led by the Operations Division, and included the commands, arms and wings as well as the General Staff.\n\nThe air defense fighters successfully intercepted using the \"Yahlom\" system a suspicious aerial target in the territory of Lebanon, which is suspected to have made its way towards the north of the country. One of the interceptors launched exploded over the sky of the country, the incident is being investigated. During the day, a number of launches were detected that crossed the territory of Lebanon to various areas in the north of the country. IDF forces attacked the sources of the shooting.\n\nThe United States Central Command (CENTCOM) overnight destroyed four long-range unmanned aerial systems launched by Houthis. According to the CENTCOM's statement, the attack targeted a U.S. warship in the Red Sea. Between 2:00 and 2:20 a.m. (Sanaa time) on March 27, United States Central Command successfully engaged and destroyed four long-range unmanned aerial systems (UAS) launched by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen. These UAS were aimed at a U.S. warship and engaged in self-defense over the Red Sea. There were no injuries or damage reported to U.S. or coalition ships. It was determined these weapons presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region. These actions are taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy and merchant vessels.\n\nThe leader of the Yemeni Ansar Allah movement, Mr. Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, confirmed that the tragedy in Gaza is getting bigger, the crimes are becoming more brutal every day, and the criminal Zionist killer is becoming more persistent, persistent, and barbaric, noting that the time of control, colonialism, subjugation and enslavement of peoples through extermination and intimidation to force surrender has passed and ended.\n\nIn his speech about the latest developments and developments, Mr. Al-Houthi pointed out that the impudence and insistence of the American partner on supporting and protecting the Zionist crime is increasing, and the responsibility is increasing on Muslims before others and then on the rest of the peoples of human society. Mr. Al-Houthi stated that what is happening in Gaza is a disgrace to all of humanity and a warning to everyone of the Zionist threat and the barbaric American colonialism.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi addressed the criminal Zionists, saying: Your crimes will certainly take you faster on the path of inevitable demise that God has threatened you with in His books. You are occupiers, and blood is a curse upon you and will sweep you from the land of Palestine, and your injustice will not be forgotten by generations and will be engraved in their consciousness, revenge against you for those who are oppressed, hostility toward you, and discontent with you. Blood flows through the arteries of all free people.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi stressed that the time of control, colonialism , subjugation and enslavement of peoples through extermination and intimidation to force surrender has passed and ended. Mr. Al-Houthi said: Go back a little to history to remember what happened to you in Vietnam, in Iraq, and in other countries. In this battle, you are in greater trouble and your loss is heavy, as you sacrifice the interests of your people in the service of the Zionists.\n\nAddressing the Americans, Mr. Al-Houthi said: You are being exposed to damage that you will not be able to compensate for for generations, and if you persist, the consequences will be worse, greater, and more dangerous. You will inherit disappointment and defeat from Britain, and the British pamper is the pamper of disappointments, defeats, and failure of your prot\u00e9g\u00e9, \"Israel,\" which you planted in our region. Here is its army actually exposed to a historical scandal.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi explained that the Israeli enemy army, for half a year, was unable to achieve an image of military victory in the narrowest geographical area, while the enemy army fought a fierce battle for 5 hours, with the participation of a helicopter and drone with one of the Palestinian heroes in Ramallah, where one resistance fighter attacked the enemy soldiers. And his settlers for nearly half a day alone. Mr. Al-Houthi pointed out that the Kuwait roundabout has become a scene for Zionist starvation crimes every week.\n\nHe added that behind the landing operation was an American plan, in coordination with the Israelis on the ground, to kill the people in the places where aid was dropped, noting that the American seeks to turn the process of landing aid into causing problems, and that the brutal American practices bring down the flimsy walls that the hypocrites and deceived people have erected before the people's awareness so that they do not see the truth of America's brutality as it is. America's brutality in Gaza must bring about an awakening in people's awareness and the falsehood towards it and its agents must be dropped.\n\nHe said that the Israeli enemy puts the displaced people between the options of death from starvation, epidemics, or murder, while it declares a safe area, and then when people gather there, it targets it, as happened this week in Al-Mawasi camp, and for the second week in a row, the Israeli enemy continues its storming and siege of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex, again creating a tragedy for patients and staff. Health and displaced people.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi continued, saying: The Israeli enemy has made hospitals primary targets for its criminal and brutal attack operations, and the Israeli enemy is actively seeking to create a rift between the Mujahideen and the Palestinian tribes with regard to the method of distributing aid. The Israeli enemy has failed and disappointed in causing a rift between the tribes and the Mujahideen due to the tribes' steadfastness in their position of embracing the resistance. He noted that the continued Israeli failure is also a failure of the American partner in the crime of genocide and comprehensive destruction of Gaza.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi reminded that the Mujahideen on all fronts of the fighting are inflicting losses on the enemy's ranks and vehicles, and that after the enemy celebrated the end of the Mujahideen's missile stock, missiles were launched from areas that the enemy had declared control towards Ashdod, explaining that the recruitment crisis is an ongoing crisis and a witness to the great failure of the Israeli enemy.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi noted that what testifies to the enemy's failure and failure is the continued adverse migration from Palestine and the flight of Zionist Jews from there. The enemy's economic losses are constantly on the rise, and Hezbollah's operations have had a significant impact on the enemy's factories in northern occupied Palestine, and Hezbollah continues on its direct and influential front. On the Israeli enemy and inflicts daily losses on the Israeli enemy.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi stressed, saying: Our front in Yemen in the battle of the promised conquest and the holy jihad, thanks to God and with His success, is an active, continuous and effective front. We hope and pray to God that His Prophet, may God's prayers be upon him and his family, will show our people in this battle what his eyes will recognize and what the faces of our people will be brightened with on the Day of Resurrection. 10 operations were carried out this week, using 37 ballistic and winged missiles and drones, and 9 ships were targeted this week, bringing the total number of ships targeted to 86 ships linked to the Israeli enemy, America and Britain.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi explained that the movement of the enemy at sea has become rare and he is trying to camouflage it to the maximum extent, and he is trying to mislead the media and information. The movement of enemy ships is similar to a smuggling operation. However, it fails and the attack is carried out effectively. A missile bombardment was carried out with winged missiles towards Umm Al-Rashrash to target affiliated targets. The Israeli enemy, thank God, has the impact of military operations at sea as well as on Palestine, and the enemy's inability to stop them is a clear issue that the enemy acknowledges. It is a great blessing that God grants success in effective action on the enemy, starting with his economic situation, which he relies on in his military aggression.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi pointed out that the only solution is to stop the aggression, crimes, and siege on the Gaza Strip, and that the bad state that the American Navy has reached is the result of American intransigence and failure to accept the correct and fair solution. American intransigence in supporting Zionist crime and aggression against our country has put it in a real dilemma, noting that the bad state What the US Navy has reached is the result of American intransigence and failure to accept the correct and fair solution. American intransigence in supporting Zionist crime and aggression against our country has put it in a real dilemma.\n\nHe said that some countries are moving in harmony with the Israeli enemy on the media level and some domestication activities. Our people are embarking on their exit from the standpoint of their faith and sense of responsibility, and they sense the unparalleled suffering of the Palestinian people. In contrast to the magnitude of the tragedy of the Palestinian people, the responsibility is truly greater in taking a serious stand for jihad and taking a stand and taking action in every way. In the areas, if we do not move to support the Palestinian people in an oppression as great as theirs, then when can we move?!! If we do not carry the banner of jihad for the sake of God Almighty against the Israeli, American and British Zionist tyranny and criminality, then against whom and when will we fight?\n\nThe political pressure on Israel is increasing with another proposal for a cease-fire coming up in the UN Security Council. This is another proposal that Israel opposes, but this time it comes from a Western friend - France, a permanent member of the Security Council, which has begun circulating a draft in favor of an immediate cease-fire during Ramadan. Israel has already made it clear that they will oppose it in the existing version, which includes recognition of a Palestinian state and full membership in the United Nations, condemnation of the violence in the settlements and confirmation that the settlements are illegal from the point of view of the United Nations. Although the text contains a section calling for the release of the abductees and even condemning Hamas, the fear is that this will be one of the first sections to be removed as part of the negotiations on the draft, as is usually the case in discussions on resolutions.\n\nThe judges of the International Court of Justice unanimously ordered Israel to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure the entry of basic food supplies to the residents of the Gaza Strip without delay. The court said, in a statement, that the Palestinians in Gaza face difficult living conditions in light of the spread of famine, and it also ordered Israel to take the necessary and effective measures to cooperate with the United Nations without delay.\n\nThe Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ( UNRWA ), Philippe Lazzarini, had revealed that Israel had informed them that it would no longer agree to send food convoys to the northern Gaza Strip, demanding that \"these restrictions be lifted.\"\n\nIn its statement, the court stressed that Israel must urgently provide basic services and humanitarian aid without hindrance on a large scale, increase the capacity and number of land crossing points into Gaza and keep them open for as long as necessary. The International Court of Justice added that Israel must ensure that its army does not commit violations of the rights of Palestinians in Gaza, such as preventing the delivery of aid. It indicated that Israel must submit a report to the court regarding the measures it will take within a month from today's date.\n\nCommenting on the court's decision, the spokesperson for the South African team told the Al Jazeera Court of Justice that the new court order for Israel requires it to cooperate with the United Nations, and this includes cooperation with UNRWA. He stressed that Israel would not comply with the court's orders, so its allies must put pressure on it. In this context, the US State Department announced that it currently has no position on the International Court of Justice's order for Israel to ensure that aid enters Gaza without obstacles.\n\nThe Director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , said today, Thursday, that 10 hospitals out of 36 are partially operating in Gaza and the health system is barely surviving. He called for an immediate halt to Israeli attacks on hospitals in Gaza, and for the protection of staff, patients and civilians. Ghebreyesus warned of the consequences of the collapse of the health system in the besieged Gaza Strip. He said on the X platform: With only 10 partially functioning hospitals out of 36, the health system in Gaza is barely surviving. He pointed out that the Palestinian Red Crescent Society announced on Tuesday that Al-Amal Hospital in the city of Khan Yunis (south) had stopped working as a result of the ongoing Israeli army attacks on the facility and its environs.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas approved the formation of the new Palestinian government headed by economist Muhammad Mustafa, who retained the foreign ministry, two weeks after his appointment. The Palestinian News and Information Agency (Wafa) reported that the new government, which does not include the names of former ministers except for Interior Minister Ziad Hab Al-Rih, will be sworn in before the president next Sunday.\n\nAbbas issued a decision to grant confidence to the government in accordance with the Palestinian Basic Law (the Constitution), which grants the president this right in the absence of the dysfunctional Legislative Council. The government includes 23 independent and professional ministers, and Wafa Agency explained that the government's program confirmed that its political authority is the Palestine Liberation Organization , \"the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nIn turn, Mustafa said, \"The first national priority is a ceasefire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza .\" He added, \"We will work to develop visions for the reunification of institutions, including assuming responsibility in Gaza.\" Mustafa, an independent economist, was chosen to form this government to implement reforms in the institutions of the Palestinian Authority that the United States of America and other international bodies have long demanded, in preparation for the stage that will follow the end of the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Saudi newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Ost reported from Palestinian sources that after Hamas lost many operatives and suffered a blow including the military, it decided to change its strategy in order to reach the \"day after the war\" with fewer losses. The terrorist organization decided to adopt a policy based on limited attacks against IDF forces, in a way that would not pose a danger to terrorists and to \"preserve part of its forces\", according to the report.\n\n\"The organization does not want to lose everything. It wants to keep part of its forces for the day after the campaign. Israel, the US, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries have their plans for the day after the war, and Hamas also has its plan,\" the sources told the newspaper.\n\nA source in the field told Al-Sharq Al-Aust that \"the repetition of the abduction operations carried out by Israel in the northern areas of the Gaza Strip and at Shifa, Al-Amal and Nazar hospitals in Khan Yunis shows the way Israel decided to operate in the Gaza Strip, an attempt to replicate what it implements in the West Bank\". According to them, this means expanding Israel's security control and carrying out targeted operations from time to time. The newspaper noted that as a result, the terrorist organizations were forced to \"also change their tactics and prepare for a longer campaign with fewer losses.\"\n\nAlthough Hamas does not have a clear estimate of how and when the war will end, it is betting that the kidnapped card will be the \"winning card\". The sources stated that \"Hamas does not intend to give up this card, because it understands its importance and makes it insist on receiving a commitment to end the war, even at a later stage, before signing a new agreement.\"\n\nThe sources who spoke to the Saudi newspaper confirmed that the military wing of Hamas and other terrorist organizations \"have lost most of their rocket power, but they still have a stockpile of rockets that they may use at any moment, especially if the war is nearing its end, in an attempt to achieve a victory image. This is indicated The latest barrages towards Ashdod, Ashkelon and Sderot\". They added that Hamas has many missiles to attack IDF forces, vehicles, mortar bombs, explosive charges and other weapons and ammunition.\n\nThe High Court issued a decision endorsing a universal draft, including the Haredi sector starting April 1 as a matter of principle, while in practice deferring any enforcement until August 9.\n\nAcademics suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will side with his partners in the \"extreme right-wing coalition\" in the crisis of recruiting ultra-Orthodox Jews, even if it requires the exit of War Council Minister Benny Gantz. The academic and expert on Israeli affairs, Dr. Muhannad Mustafa, said that Netanyahu is facing the biggest political crisis that exceeds his crisis with Washington, believing that he will prefer to go for a law that is largely consistent with the aspirations of the religious parties, even if it costs him the withdrawal of Gantz, who has been a political, social, and international cover for the \"right-wing\" government since the beginning of the war.\n\nThe second scenario - which Mustafa rules out happening - is to adopt a law that is closer to the secular parties, which will lead to the loss of the religious parties and the fall of the government. Netanyahu is also trying to avoid going to early elections, which implicitly means stopping the war on Gaza, in addition to the fall of him and the \"right-wing\" camp and the formation of an alternative government headed by Gantz, according to the expert on Israeli affairs.\n\nMustafa confirms that the current crisis comes in the context of the occupation army's need for reserve soldiers, after neglecting this issue, including the recruitment of Haredim , indicating that Israel has a final opportunity to legislate the law after the Supreme Court overturned previous laws. He adds that Netanyahu's government is obligated to enact this law, \"and without it, the government will not be able to exempt the Haredim,\" and it must present the law to the Knesset next June to vote on it.\n\nIn turn, Dr. Hassan Ayoub, professor of political science at An-Najah University in Palestine, confirms that the Haredi recruitment crisis highlights the extent of political opportunism, whether on the part of Netanyahu or his partners in the coalition or the opposition. He confirms that the crisis is not only related to military calculations in light of the army's need for more manpower, but there is an economic aspect related to the state budget, before summarizing the scene as a crisis defined by the state itself. He believes that the crisis will cast a shadow by creating a rift in Israeli society between the liberal secular side and the religious side, adding that it is difficult to get out of this impasse and stressing the necessity of concluding a new deal.\n\nThe Palestinian academic believes that the issue of Haredi recruitment seriously threatens the survival of Netanyahu's government because all parties have become entrenched and extremist in a way that does not seem to have a way out, ruling out that Netanyahu will escape the pressure of this crisis. Regarding the nature of these religious parties, Mustafa explains that the Haredim constitute 13% of Israeli society and are expected to reach 20% in 2050. He added that it is an extremist religious group that does not recognize Zionism and lives in geographically isolated neighborhoods that differ in their dress. It has succeeded in integrating while preserving its political and cultural interests, especially education in closed neighborhoods.\n\nHe shows that the Haredi group is one of the highest groups in terms of population growth, as the rate of birth of Haredi women is between 7 and 8 children. They also do not study English, mathematics, and science, and are limited to religious curricula. \"Therefore, they are uneducated, uncultured, unproductive, and consuming, and are not integrated into the Israeli economy.\"\n\nHaaretz newspaper quoted a letter sent by the Israeli government's judicial advisor, Gali Behrav Meara, to the Israeli Supreme Court, stating that the recruitment of religious Haredim must begin from the beginning of next month. The content of the letter stated that \"recruitment authorities must act with regard to the recruitment procedures for those whose service has been postponed according to the law or for those who have reached the Haredi conscription age, leaving the method of implementation for later.\" The letter also stated that the government will not be able to transfer budget funds to religious centers and schools for those who do not send a request for conscription and those who are not conscripts.\n\nThe newspaper added that the Israeli Attorney General's Office had opposed the attempt of Benjamin Netanyahu's government to extend the deadline for the draft law on conscription of ultra-Orthodox Jews. The Board of Grievances had asked to extend the submission of the application until Thursday afternoon, which the newspaper considered a slap on the part of the judicial advisor to Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n\nThe Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth previously reported that the religious parties in the ruling coalition threatened to withdraw if a new conscription law was adopted that abolished the exemption enjoyed by religious Jews. The newspaper added that the religious Jewish parties are threatening to withdraw from the government if the percentage of those who will be forced to conscript is determined in the draft law that the government is trying to pass.\n\nFor its part, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation quoted the leaders of the Haredi parties as saying - during a meeting with Netanyahu - that the demands to put an end to the exemption of religious people from military service contradict the agreement to form the coalition. Haredi leaders added that there is a fear that the rabbis will ask them to withdraw from the government if a new law abolishing the exemption is passed.\n\nNetanyahu's right-wing government had sought to enact a law exempting the Haredim from military service, which opened the door wide to interactions in Israel between supporters and opponents, which heralded a crisis within the emergency government. While the religious parties oppose compromising the principle of exempting religious people from military service, ministers including War Council member Benny Gantz, Defense Minister Yoav Galant, and opposition leader Yair Lapid are calling for an end to this exemption.\n\nWar Council member Benny Gantz had threatened to withdraw if the Knesset approved a draft law maintaining the exemption of religious people from military conscription, and from Washington, Gallant announced that he would not support the draft law in its current form that maintains the exemption of the Haredim from military service. As for the opposition leader, he attacked Netanyahu and the conscription law in its current form, and Lapid called on members of the Likud Party to oppose the proposed law, which he described as a conscription evasion law. Since 2017, successive governments have failed to reach a consensus law regarding the recruitment of Haredim, after the Supreme Court annulled a law enacted in 2015, which ruled to exempt them from military service, considering that it violates the \"principle of equality.\"\n\nAt a time when Israel insists on continuing its military operations in the Gaza Strip, in pursuit of its declared goals, which are the release of hostages held in the Strip and \"eliminating Hamas,\" many believe that the country \"cannot reconcile\" the two goals, which has become clear. The Israelis' positions on this matter differ, according to what the American newspaper \" Wall Street Journal \" reported. Israelis are divided over how to prioritize the country's two main war goals: \"destroying\" Hamas, and freeing some 130 hostages, including more than 30 bodies of hostages killed after they were kidnapped nearly six months ago.\n\nDivisions have escalated as Israel negotiates with Hamas, through the United States, Egypt and Qatar, over a ceasefire that could last 6 weeks and see the release of 40 hostages. These hostages will be children, the elderly, the sick and women, including female soldiers. Hamas demands that Israel release thousands of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom are considered \"terrorists\" in Israel. Hamas also wants Israel to agree to concessions that could preserve the group's control of Gaza, even after the group, designated by the United States as a terrorist organization, planned and carried out the worst attack in Israel's history.\n\nMitchell Barak, a political analyst at Keyvon Global Research based in Jerusalem, said: \"The two goals contradict each other, and both cannot happen,\" adding: \"No side will be happy here.\" Forty-seven percent of Israeli Jews participating in the most recent public poll on the issue, conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute in January, said Israel \"should prioritize freeing the hostages,\" while 42 percent said it \"should put the destruction of Hamas first.\" The poll found that those who favored the release of the hostages \"largely voted for left or center parties,\" while those who favored the destruction of Hamas \"supported right-wing and religious parties.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set eliminating Hamas and freeing the hostages as two goals to \"win\" the war, but analysts say that reconciling them is an \"almost impossible task.\" On the one hand, there are Israelis from the center and left and most of the hostage families, who have become a political force since the war began, and are willing to pay a heavy price for their freedom. They claim, according to the newspaper, that the state \"has a fundamental moral duty towards the hostages, which if violated would undermine citizens' sense of security in the foreseeable future.\" They also say that \"Hamas can be fought in the future, but the hostages may die in the present.\"\n\nBut Israel's right wing - Netanyahu's political base - \"largely opposes, on moral grounds, any agreement that allows Hamas to remain in power and releases thousands of prisoners involved in terrorist attacks, because it would endanger Israel's national security and the lives of future citizens and soldiers.\" According to the Wall Street Journal. They say the hostages should be released \"by forcing Hamas to release them, as a result of military pressure.\"\n\nThe American newspaper reported that social scientists considered that the division between liberals and conservatives in Israel, over the price that must be paid to free the hostages, \"reflects their basic views about the relationship between citizens and the state.\" \"For many religious and right-wing Israelis, the group and the state are above the individual,\" said Menachem Mautner, a professor at Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Law. \"The individual is supposed to serve the group.\" As for the left movement in Israel, according to Mautner, \"the state, first and foremost, is a tool for preserving our (its citizens) lives.\"\n\nFormer Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami said that the United States wanted to bend Israel's arm by refraining from announcing a veto against a draft resolution for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip last week, and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now convinced that US President Joe Biden wants to overthrow it. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais, the last Israeli foreign minister in a government led by the Labor Party said that Biden was fed up with Netanyahu and that abstaining from using the veto in the Security Council was \"part of a progressive strategy to send signals to Israel that things can change.\" The abstention was a severe blow to Netanyahu, and its importance exceeded the importance of other similar steps in recent years.\n\nAccording to Ben Ami, the change in the American position appeared, for example, in a statement by Biden leaked to the media that Netanyahu had become a burden, but he does not see the abstention from using the veto as a change in the American strategy in the Middle East as much as he sees it as an attempt to twist Israel's arm, which made Netanyahu convinced that Biden wants to bring him down. Ben-Ami said that although Washington was keen to limit itself to abstaining from voting for the resolution (which was not binding), its step clearly expressed a willingness to go further in the pressure, especially if Netanyahu's rule continued, which, according to him, would be as embarrassing as it was Biden, and he stated that the close and volatile relationship between the two parties was wise. There are always clear limits, which are not to obstruct American geopolitical interests or the goals of the White House resident .\n\nHe explained that Biden cannot launch the election season burdened by the burden of the failure of his strategy in the Middle East, not to mention his need to save face before world leaders. Ben Ami - who was one of the architects of the Israeli-Arab peace processes in the past few decades - added that Israel is living in a state of isolation and described it as \"a threat to Western goals in the current cold war between the United States on the one hand and China and Russia on the other hand.\"\n\nAccording to the former minister, Biden had a clear strategy in the Middle East, based on a solid alliance with Israel and the Arab countries against Iran , and the great success of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) was in dragging Netanyahu into a war without clear political goals that removed Israel from the Western alliance that had been established. Recent years, which supports Ukraine against Russia and China.\n\nBen Ami referred to what he calls the extremely sudden explosion against Israel in the world, the likes of which has never happened before, and according to him this is a great victory for Hamas, and he said that what prevents confronting this explosion is Netanyahu's extremist government. He also warned Israel against being blind to the major trends present in American society and seeking to distance itself from Israel, whether in the Democratic Party or among young people, and held Netanyahu responsible for the rise in popularity of the more extreme trends in American society, such as evangelicals or \"Trumpism.\"\n\nThe former Israeli minister noted another damage caused by the Prime Minister, which was the rift in American Jewish support. He said that Netanyahu and his extremist government were able to split the ranks of American Jews who have never failed to support Israel, to the point that there is now among them a movement calling for the adoption of a new ideology that ends dependence on Israel.\n\nA US State Department official working in the field of human rights in the Middle East announced her resignation on Wednesday in protest against Washington's support for Israel in its war on Gaza, according to a report published by the Washington Post. Annelle Sheline (38 years old) submitted her resignation from the US State Department, where she had been working as a foreign affairs officer in the Office of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor for about a year.\n\nThis is considered the second resignation of US State Department officials in protest against the US policy of supporting Israel in its war on Gaza, after the resignation of Josh Paul, who was responsible for arms transfers to foreign governments. In an article published by CNN , Sheline explained the reasons that prompted her to resign, noting that she strongly believes in her work in promoting human rights in the Middle East.\n\nShe added that \"as a representative of a government working directly to enable what the International Court of Justice said could be genocide in Gaza, this work has become almost impossible, and due to my inability to serve an administration that allows such atrocities, I have decided to resign from my position in the State Department.\" \"The credibility that the United States had as a defender of human rights has almost completely disappeared since the war began,\" Sheline said in her article. She continued that through her public resignation, she knew that she \"would likely be deprived of any future work in the State Department,\" noting that she had been appointed to a two-year contract, but when she began to tell her colleagues about her position, their response was, \"Please speak on our behalf\", referring to the dissatisfaction of many State Department employees with Washington's policy of supporting Israel in the war.\n\nNot every number is reported every day, so sudden jumps generally reflect reporting artifacts rather than actual upticks. Many of these numbers fluctate, up and down, with no apparent explanation. This list records the highest number reliably reported for each matter, under the theory that reality with catch up with reports, as is relentlessly the case.",

        "body": "PETALING JAYA: Following the year-to-date market performance, Kenanga Research is maintaining its end-2024 FBM KLCI target of 1,605 points.\n\nThis is based on 15 times the forecast 2024 earnings, which is consistent with the historical price-earnings range of between 14 times and 16 times post the economy reopening, said the research firm in its second quarter 2024 (2Q24) investment strategy report.\n\nThe key driver for global markets this year is expectations of policy easing by central banks in advanced economies, particularly by the United States Federal Reserve (Fed). This will augur well for emerging markets (EM), including Malaysia, in two major ways.\n\nFirstly, it will make EM assets attractive again, given a lower risk-free return of developed market (DM) assets, while EM assets offer a strong potential in terms of translation gains.\n\n\"The lower borrowing cost of hard currencies will also be supportive of the EM carry trade, ie, borrowing in low-interest hard currencies to invest in high-yielding EM assets such as equities, bonds, commodities and real estate.\"\n\nSecondly, a synchronised recovery in advanced economies underpinned by policy easing will fuel an export boom in the largely export-dependent EM economies.\n\nThis will provide a lift to their domestic labour markets and wage growth, and hence consumer spending.\n\nIn addition, the export sector in EM may also be buoyed by the recovery of the global semiconductor sector.\n\nAt its meeting in March, the Fed kept the target range of its funds rate at 5.25%-5.50% and end-2024 Fed funds rate forecast of 4.6%, effectively signalling three rate cuts in 2024, said Kenanga Research.\n\nOn the other end, risk factors that could derail the rally in the local market are policy rates staying higher for longer in advanced economies and the performance of China's economy, which has experienced a noticeable slowdown on the back of an export slump, weak domestic consumption and losses in household wealth due to the crash in both the stock and property markets.\n\nFreight cost inflation and supply-chain disruptions arising from the Red Sea conflict could also weigh on the Malaysian economy. However, Kenanga Research said it takes comfort that these issues are manageable.\n\n\"We pick banks for a proxy to the return of foreign investors given the heavy weighting that banking stocks command in various indices. We are upbeat on contractors given the imminent rollout of the MRT3, Bayan Lepas LRT and the six flood mitigation projects reportedly to be worth RM13bil.\"\n\nIn the oil and gas sector, it likes offshore supply vessel owners due to a supply crunch on a surge in demand leading to strong charter rates and floating production, storage and offloading players given the current upcycle in the space.\n\nHowever, it said the recovery in global semiconductor sales may take time to be fully transmitted to local players, which are mostly involved in the back-end of the semiconductor supply chain.\n\nMeanwhile, MIDF Research has an FBM KLCI target of 1,665 points for 2024, pegged to a price-earnings of 14 times.\n\nIt said the world's equity market would remain generally bullish due to the possible onset of Fed interest rate cuts, while earnings are expected to be stable given the better economy growth seen for Malaysia.\n\n\"Moreover, the prospect of a stronger ringgit vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar would attract returning inflow of foreign funds, hence providing a necessary fillip to the local equity market.\n\n\"On the flip side, we advise investors to tread cautiously and be wary of the lingering risk of a US recession, as well as the unsettling situation in Ukraine and Palestine which could escalate,\" MIDF Research said in its report.\n\nOn the local economy, the research firm maintains its expectation of growth hitting 4.7%, to be driven by resilient domestic demand and external trade recovery.\n\nA recovery in external trade will benefit trade-related stocks such as logistics and ports. The research firm still sees the prospect of an upside in the construction sector.",

        "body": "President Biden will have an entourage of support from celebrities and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at a historic campaign fundraiser set to raise more than $25 million Thursday night, as Biden continues to aggressively campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe event at Radio City Music Hall in New York is meant to reinforce Biden's campaign finances and widen his voter outreach.\n\nBiden already has a commanding lead over Trump in campaign finances, especially as Trump and his groups are figuring out how to cover Trump's legal costs. But Biden and Democrats aren't holding back to increase that gap: By mid March, Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee amassed a combined $155 million cash on hand, while the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee ended February with $44.85 million cash on hand. Since Super Tuesday, the Biden campaign has outspent the Trump team on pre-booked advertising by nearly four times.\n\n\"This historic raise is a show of strong enthusiasm for President Biden and Vice President Harris and a testament to the unprecedented fundraising machine we've built,\" said Biden-Harris 2024 campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nObama and Clinton uniting forces behind Biden could help the incumbent weather the unique political challenges that his predecessors -- who both had higher approval ratings than Biden during their reelection campaigns -- did not have to face: the aftermath of a worldwide pandemic, the Jan. 6 insurrection, turmoil over abortion access, and a growing protest vote campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nA star-studded cast will also appear with the former presidents and Biden, including Mindy Kaling, Ben Platt and Stephen Colbert hosting the event.\n\nIt's an opportunity for Biden to counter concerns about his age and polls that show a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nThe Trump campaign notes that Biden hasn't had to spend money fending off primary challengers, like Trump has. The Trump campaign also is just now getting access to the Republican National Committee support since officially securing the nomination.\n\n\"Our digital online fundraising continues to skyrocket, our major donor investments are climbing, and Democrats are running scared of the fundraising prowess of President Trump,\" said Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung.\n\nAnother challenge for Trump, though, are his mounting legal fees, which his political action committee is spending money on.\n\nKatzenberg took a swipe at that fact, and said Biden is focused on demonstrating his track record to voters.\n\n\"Unlike our opponent, every dollar we're raising is going to reach the voters who will decide this election -- communicating the President's historic record, his vision for the future and laying plain the stakes of this election.\"\n\nThe money race isn't anywhere near over. Trump and the Republican Party have a fundraiser next week that they say will overshadow Biden's event by raising at least $33 million.",

        "title": "With 3rd Democratic senator opposed, Biden judicial nominee in jeopardy",
        "body": "President Biden's pick to be the first Muslim American appeals court judge appears to be in jeopardy after a third Democratic senator came out against him Wednesday, part of a groundswell of opposition over the nominee's ties to an organization that represents Muslim, Arab and South Asian law students and a group that advocates for incarcerated people and their families.\n\nSen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., told the Nevada Independent that she would not support Adeel A. Mangi's nomination to the Philadelphia-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, citing \"concerns I've heard from law enforcement in Nevada.\"\n\nRosen is the third Democratic senator -- and second senator from Nevada -- to come out against Mangi, a Harvard- and Oxford-trained lawyer in private practice who has been accused by Republican senators of being antisemitic and anti-police.\n\nSens. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., have also said they would not vote for him. Cortez Masto expressed concerns about Mangi's membership on the advisory board of the criminal justice reform group Alliance of Families for Justice. Manchin told Politico he will not vote for any judicial nominee who does not have at least some bipartisan support.\n\nThe White House said Thursday that it is still trying to marshal support for Mangi and convince lawmakers that the attacks against him are baseless.\n\n\"Some Senate Republicans and their extreme allies are relentlessly smearing Adeel Mangi with baseless accusations that he is anti-police,\" White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients said in a statement. \"That could not be further from the truth, and the close to a dozen law enforcement organizations that have endorsed him agree.\"\n\nThe White House earlier this month called the attacks against Mangi a \"cruel, Islamophobic, smear campaign.\"\n\nRepublicans and conservative groups such as the Judicial Crisis Network have accused Mangi of sharing antisemitic views espoused by panelists who spoke at events hosted by Rutgers Law School's Center for Security, Race and Rights. Mangi, an experienced litigator and a partner at a New York law firm, previously served as a member of the center's advisory board.\n\nIn 2021, on the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2021, attacks, the center hosted a roundtable discussion that featured several controversial speakers. Republicans criticized that event and a more recent lecture on life under \"violent occupation and settler colonial violence in Palestine,\" which the center hosted just days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 Israelis and included the kidnapping of about 250 hostages. During Mangi's Dec. 13 nomination hearing, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned him about the Hamas attack and whether he believed they were justified.\n\n\"The events of October 7 were horrific. A horror,\" Mangi said, noting that his time on the center's advisory board did not mean he shares the views of all who work or speak there. \"The attacks on civilians were abominable and against everything that I stand for.\"\n\nMangi has separately drawn criticism from more than a dozen law enforcement organizations, such as the Police Conference of New York, according to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. But other groups, including the International Law Enforcement Officers Association and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, are supporting him, as are the AFL-CIO, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee and a coalition of more than a dozen Jewish organizations.\n\n\"Mr. Mangi has displayed the qualities of leadership, empathy, excellence, and persistence in supporting and defending the U.S. Constitution while ensuring equal protection and justice for all Americans,\" NOBLE wrote in an endorsement letter reviewed by The Post.\n\nPriya Purandare, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, also expressed support for Mangi in a statement. \"The baseless attacks against Mr. Mangi have a chilling effect,\" she said. \"If left unanswered, the nation runs the risk of losing a generation of talent who shares Mr. Mangi's faith from entering public service and the opportunity to compose a federal bench that reflects the changing demographics of the United States. History will remember this moment.\"\n\nWith Cortez Masto, Manchin and Rosen opposed to his confirmation, Mangi would need the support of moderate Republicans such as Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to be confirmed. The Judicial Crisis Network has launched anti-Mangi ads in Montana, Pennsylvania and D.C., targeting Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Bob Casey, D-Pa.\n\nIf Biden pulls Mangi's nomination or he withdraws, it would be a rare defeat for a president who has made diversifying the nation's federal judiciary a key priority. Biden nominated Zahid N. Quraishi as the first Muslim federal district court judge early in his term.\n\nMangi would be Biden's third judicial nominee to withdraw. Michael Delaney gave up his nomination to the Boston-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit in May following Democratic concerns about his past work defending a New Hampshire boarding school in a lawsuit over sexual assault.\n\nLess than a week later, Jabari Wamble dropped his bid to become a U.S. district judge in Kansas. The White House didn't provide an explanation for the withdrawal, but The Associated Press, citing an official familiar with the confirmation process who spoke on the condition of anonymity, reported that Wamble was expecting to receive a \"not qualified\" rating from the American Bar Association, which grades judicial candidates.\n\nThe firestorm surrounding Mangi's nomination comes at a time of heightened political sensitivity surrounding the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and Israel's prolonged military response. Threats against Arab, Jewish and Muslim Americans are on the rise, according to federal officials, and college campuses have been embroiled in angry debates over Zionism, Palestinian rights, antisemitism and free speech.\n\nBut Mangi's supporters, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., still stand behind him.\n\n\"When we look at Mr. Mangi's record -- his professional life, his commitment to religious freedom and civil rights, his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee -- it only reinforces his commitment to upholding and advancing the fundamental values we all hold as Americans,\" Booker said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"I'm proud to champion his nomination and I know the White House, Senate Democratic leaders, and I stand behind Adeel Mangi 100 percent.\"",

        "title": "Simple pre-surgical protocol can help prevent dangerous post-surgical infections",
        "body": "Mar 28 2024Association for Professionals in Infection Control\n\nA new study published today in the American Journal of Infection Control (AJIC) demonstrates the use of a simple pre-surgical infection prevention protocol to prevent dangerous post-surgical infections. Researchers performed this investigation at the Soroka University Medical Center in Israel.\n\nSurgical site infections (SSIs) are a type of healthcare-associated infection with deadly consequences for some patients. According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 110,000 SSIs linked to inpatient surgeries in the U.S. in 2015. These infections lead to a high rate of morbidity and mortality, with a patient's estimated risk of death as much as 11 times higher than normal. SSIs also have a very high financial burden, with the average hospital stay extended by nearly 10 days and an estimated $20,000 in additional hospitalization costs per patient.\n\nThere are a number of recommended protocols to help prevent SSIs, but lack of patient compliance, high costs, and bacterial resistance can reduce their utility and effectiveness. In this new study, researchers aimed to evaluate the results of a protocol designed to reduce SSIs through a particular focus on the Staphylococcus aureus pathogen. The approach involved a pre-surgical intranasal application of povidone-iodine and skin antisepsis using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG).\n\nThe study involved 688 adult patients who had hip or knee arthroplasty or spine surgery at Soroka University Medical Center between February 2018 and October 2021. Their outcomes were compared to a retrospective patient cohort from 2016 and 2017 treated before the povidone-iodine component of the protocol was implemented. Patient outcomes were tracked for 90 days after surgery.\n\nDeploying this intervention prior to surgery helped to address a broad challenge in healthcare, that some 30% of the population is colonized with S. aureus without exhibiting symptoms. The pre-surgical protocol successfully eradicated S. aureus in nearly 40% of patients found to already harbor the pathogen. This is particularly important for patient outcomes, as the researchers found that the presence of S. aureus within the day following surgery was associated with a three-fold risk of developing an SSI. Overall, the study showed a significant decrease in severe SSIs among patients who received the newer protocol.\n\n\"Our study clearly shows that we can prevent surgical site infections and keep patients safer through the use of a simple pre-surgical nasal application of povidone-iodine in combination with standard CHG bathing,\" said Lisa Saidel-Odes, MD, Infectious Diseases specialist at Soroka University Medical Center and lead author of the paper. \"We noted that the protocol is most effective in cases with little S. aureus present and suggest that an additional application of the povidone-iodine might be needed for patients with greater nasal colonization.\"\n\nAdditional details from the study include:\n\nOf the 688 patients included, 28 developed an SSI in the 90-day study window. Patients with diabetes were at particularly increased risk for developing an SSI. Patients were screened for S. aureus prior to surgery. More than 16% were already colonized with either methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of patients who developed SSIs, S. aureus was not the only cause of infection. Eleven patients were infected with Enterobacterales.\n\nThis study shows the power of applying widely available antiseptics to reduce SSIs and improve patient safety. The results are encouraging not only because the regimen is effective in reducing SSI, but also because it is simple to implement and avoids the risk of antibiotic resistance.\"\n\nTania Bubb, PhD, RN, CIC, FAPIC, 2024 APIC president\n\nAssociation for Professionals in Infection Control\n\nJournal reference:\n\nSaidel-Odes, L., et al.

        "title": "UN Court Orders Israel to Open More Aid Paths into Gaza",
        "body": "The top United Nations court on Thursday ordered Israel in a legally binding decree to open more land crossings into Gaza to allow more humanitarian aid for famished Palestinians into the territory.\n\nThe order from the International Court of Justice in the Hague told Israel to take 'all necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay\" to send in \"urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance,' including food, water, fuel and medical supplies.\n\nThe court also ordered Israel to immediately ensure 'that its military does not commit acts which constitute a violation of any of the rights of the Palestinians in Gaza as a protected group under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, including by preventing, through any action, the delivery of urgently needed humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nThe court told Israel to report back within a month on how it was implementing the orders.\n\nIsrael had no immediate comment on the ruling, but it has stringently denied committing genocide in its conduct of the nearly six-month war against Hamas militants. It urged the U.N. court not to issue new orders.\n\nThe order came in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in Gaza. The conflict started with Hamas's shock October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 and led to the capture of about 250 hostages. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and according to the Israeli military, several thousand Hamas militants.\n\nIsrael's military reported fighting Thursday near the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, as well as in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.\n\nSmoke billows over buildings following Israeli bombardment in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on March 27, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nThe Health Ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said Thursday that 62 Palestinians had been killed during the previous day.\n\nIn a reversal, Israel agreed Wednesday to send its war strategists to Washington to discuss its intention to launch a ground assault on Hamas militants in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\nOn Monday, Israel had called off the trip in protest of the U.S. refusal to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire.\n\nThe United States, Israel's staunchest ally, abstained from this week's U.N. vote after vetoing similar resolutions earlier. That drew a rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, evidence of a growing split with Washington over Israel's conduct of the war.\n\nBut even as Netanyahu called off a trip by one set of his war strategists, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was in Washington for talks this week with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nNetanyahu has said a Rafah attack is necessary to erase any Hamas control of Gaza, the narrow enclave along the Mediterranean Sea. But the U.S. has told Israel it is opposed to a Rafah invasion, especially since more than a million Palestinian civilians are sheltered there in makeshift tents and structures.\n\nIsrael has said it will move the Palestinians to safety before any attack on four Hamas battalions based in Rafah, but it has not indicated where it would send them.\n\nWhile maintaining that the U.S. abstention was \"very, very bad,\" Netanyahu told visiting U.S. Republican Senator Rick Scott that his initial cancellation of the Israeli delegation's trip \"was a message first and foremost to Hamas: Don't bet on this [United Nations] pressure [for a cease-fire]. It's not going to work.\"\n\nNetanyahu said the Security Council vote \"encouraged Hamas to take a hard line and to believe that international pressure will prevent Israel\" from achieving its war aims. Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the Hamas military is destroyed and the remaining 100 or so hostages it is holding are freed.\n\nThe White House said that it was \"a good thing\" to hold more talks with Israeli officials and that a date is being discussed.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.",

        "title": "Can The UN Security Council Help Bring Peace To Gaza? - Analysis",
        "body": "By Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA)\n\nAfter 171 days of conflict in Gaza, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) finally adopted a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan. Introduced by Mozambique on behalf of the elected Council members (E-10) on 25 March, Resolution 2728 received 14 votes in favour and one abstention (United States).1 It calls for a ceasefire respected by all parties for lasting peace, demanding the unconditional release of hostages and ensuring humanitarian access.\n\nThe resolution ended the state of paralysis of the Security Council and its repeated failures to effectively address the conflict in Gaza. However, despite the unified stance of the Council on ceasefire, Israel's response has raised doubts about the resolution's effectiveness in achieving peace. The US decision to abstain from the vote prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel the scheduled visit of his top advisers to the US for discussions on the offensive.2 Two ministers in Netanyahu's war cabinet have also declared that the country will not abide by the resolution, further complicating the path to peace.3\n\nOn 7 October 2023, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a large-scale armed attack against Israel, firing thousands of rockets and conducting raids in border areas, resulting in approximately 1,200 civilian deaths and the capture of 253 hostages. In response, Israel conducted air strikes against Hamas in Gaza. Subsequently, on 28 October, Israel initiated a ground offensive with the objective of eliminating Hamas and rescuing the hostages. United Nations reports that since 7 October, over 1,200 Israelis were killed, with more than 5,500 injured, while nearly 32,000 Palestinians were killed and about 73,000 injured.4\n\nSince the conflict began, the Security Council has voted on nine resolutions; however, only two have been adopted. The first three drafts were vetoed by the US. The first resolution on 16 October 2023 drafted by Russia proposed an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It was however not adopted due to US veto.5 The draft received support from China, Gabon, Mozambique and the United Arab Emirates, while France, Japan, the US and the United Kingdom voted against it. The remaining six Council members abstained from voting.6\n\nThe second resolution was drafted by Brazil, and voted on 18 October. Twelve of the Council's 15 members voted in favour, while the US voted against, and Russia and the UK abstained.7 The UNSC also rejected two amendments proposed by Russia in the Brazilian draft, which called for an immediate, durable and full ceasefire, as well as for stopping attacks against civilians. The US explained the veto by stating that the resolution did not mention Israel's right of self-defence.8\n\nOn 25 October, the UNSC voted on two competing draft resolutions -- one from the US and the other from Russia -- addressing the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The US' draft failed due to the vetoes of China and Russia. The Russian draft saw the US and the UK voting against it, while China, Gabon, Russia and the UAE favoured it, with nine members abstaining.9\n\nAfter a series of negotiations, on 15 November, the UNSC adopted its first resolution on Gaza since the war began. Proposed by Malta, the resolution called for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip to facilitate the provision of essential goods and services. It was adopted with 12 votes in favour and three abstentions (Russia, the UK and the US).10 However, on 8 December, the US vetoed another resolution drafted by the UAE. There were 13 votes in favour and the United Kingdom abstained.11\n\nOn 22 December, the UNSC adopted a resolution requesting the Secretary-General to appoint a Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator to establish a UN mechanism for speeding up humanitarian aid to Gaza.12 The resolution called for 'urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days to enable full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access'.13 It also emphasised the need for creating conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\n\nOn 20 February 2024, Algeria drafted a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Despite receiving support from 13 out of 15 members, the resolution failed to pass, with the UK abstaining and the US voting against it.14 Again on 22 March, Russia and China vetoed a US draft that demanded a temporary ceasefire in Gaza.15 Three days later, the UNSC adopted Resolution 2728, effectively ending the nearly six-month-long paralysis of the Council regarding a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nResolution 2728 calls for an immediate ceasefire during the month of Ramadan, which should be respected by all parties and lead to a lasting and sustainable ceasefire. It also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, along with ensuring humanitarian access to address their medical and other needs. Furthermore, it demands that all parties comply with their obligations under international law regarding the detainees.\n\nThe resolution carries political implications beyond its text, particularly due to the US decision to abstain, which enabled its adoption. In the past six months, the United States has vetoed five draft resolutions, three of which demanded a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nFollowing the abstention, US explained that it did not oppose Resolution 2728 because its text aligns with Washington's position that any ceasefire text must include provisions for the release of hostages.16 The US said that a ceasefire would strengthen negotiations by Egypt, Israel, Qatar, and the US to achieve the release of hostages.\n\nThe US decision not to veto the resolution signalled the White House's growing frustration with Israeli actions, including hospital attacks and aid restrictions in Gaza. Previously, the US had warned against Netanyahu's plans for a ground offensive in Rafah.17 Furthermore, criticism against the Biden administration is mounting, both domestically and internationally. Nonetheless, the US abstention did not signify a change in Washington's policy towards Israel. Last week, the US Congress approved US$ 3.8 billion in military aid to Israel and suspended funding to the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) until March 2025.\n\nIsrael's response to the resolution indicates its reluctance to accept a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has a history of flouting UNSC resolutions. For instance, in December 2016, the UNSC passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Palestine as illegal and a violation of international law. Despite receiving 14 votes in favour and a US abstention, Israel chose to ignore this resolution.\n\nIf Israel chooses the same path on Resolution 2728, the UNSC has limited options. The Council can pass another resolution specifically addressing the breach. This subsequent resolution may include punitive measures, such as imposing sanctions. However, it is unlikely that the US supports a resolution at the UNSC that imposes punitive measures against Israel. In such a scenario, Resolution 2728 would serve solely as a symbolic gesture, recognising the UNSC's limited influence on global peace and security issues. Nevertheless, the Council's ability to reach a consensus on the text, after five previous vetoes on the matter, may be viewed as a glimmer of hope.\n\nViews expressed are of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Manohar Parrrikar IDSA or of the Government of India.\n\nAbout the author: Dr Rajeesh Kumar is Associate Fellow at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi.",

        "title": "How Latin American Muslims observe Ramadan amid sadness and",
        "body": "SAO PAULO: Throughout Latin America, Muslim communities are observing Ramadan this year without the atmosphere of festivity that is common during the iftar meal owing to the suffering in Gaza, where more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on Oct. 7.\n\n\"This will be one of the worst Ramadan celebrations for us,\" said Bashar Shakerat, a community leader in an area on the border between Uruguay and Brazil called Little Palestine due to the relatively high concentration of Palestinian immigrants.\n\n\"We're praying at the mosque and there's no festivity later. Everybody is sad.\"\n\nOn Sundays during Ramadan, women traditionally cook large meals and people gather at the social club to celebrate. On weeknights, groups usually gather at home for iftar. Shakerat said nothing like that is happening this year.\n\n\"We just want to pray and stay quiet at home,\" he told Arab News. \"We just want this war to be over. We're tired. We want peace.\"\n\nBorn in the Palestinian city of Jenin, Shakerat said he has family in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, as do many of the residents of Little Palestine.\n\n\"We traditionally collect food kits and distribute them among needy families in our city. We know that our brothers and sisters in Palestine are also starving,\" he added.\n\nMuslim communities in Latin America do not have a high number of Palestinians. Even so, the feeling of closeness to Gazans is omnipresent.\n\n\"Our mosque was founded decades ago by Palestinian immigrants. They moved to other cities or died over the years, and now most of our community are Africans or Brazilians,\" Turkish-born Sheikh Adil Pechliye, spiritual leader of Palestine Mosque in the Brazilian city of Criciuma, told Arab News.\n\nDespite the demographic change in the community, the mosque's members still have a deep connection to Palestine, said Pechliye, who graduated in Madinah in 2001.\n\n\"We've joined Criciuma's pro-Palestine committee, and have been active in protests and marches against the genocide in Gaza,\" he added.\n\nPechliye has been giving lectures on Palestine, and gave a Friday sermon in a public square a few weeks ago in order to disseminate information on Gaza.\n\nA couple of months ago, the Muslim community promoted a relief campaign and sent aid to the Palestinian enclave.\n\nPechliye believes that most Brazilians support the Palestinians despite the pro-Israel stance of the Brazilian press.\n\nHe praised President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has been fiercely critical of Israel and even compared what is happening in Gaza to the Holocaust.\n\n\"The Holocaust was undeniably terrible, but I don't think Lula tried to downplay its seriousness. He wanted to emphasize the horror of what's happening now,\" Pechliye said.\n\nIn the city of Santa Ana in El Salvador, the Muslim community also gathers to pray at a mosque named Palestine.\n\nMezquita Palestina Tierra Santa was founded in 2011 by a community that is almost completely made up of converted Salvadorans.\n\n\"We wished to honor Armando Bukele, who introduced Islam to El Salvador and whose family came from Palestine,\" Sheikh Guillermo Sanchez told Arab News.\n\nBukele was born in El Salvador to Christian parents from Palestine, but he converted to Islam and was an imam for several years. His son Nayib is the current president of El Salvador.\n\nSanchez said his community \"has strong ties with Palestine, and has been struggling to support Gazans in every way possible. A few weeks ago, we promoted a campaign to collect donations and sent it to Gaza.\"\n\nIn the Colombian city of Cali, the Muslim community is in constant sorrow for the Palestinians, said Egyptian-born Sheikh Amr Nabil.\n\n\"At night we'll have something to eat with our brothers here, but Gazans won't have anything,\" he told Arab News. \"That's very painful, and at the same time it helps us understand the injustices of our world.\"\n\nSince the beginning of Ramadan, the community in Cali has been praying for the Palestinians, and leaders such as Nabil have been giving lectures about Palestine and the roots of the conflict.\n\n\"I believe that only somebody who is completely uninformed about the Palestinian struggle is capable of supporting the ongoing genocide, or it's a person who has completely lost humanity,\" he said.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro has criticized on several occasions Israel's attacks on Gaza. Many Muslims in the South American nation support his stance.\n\n\"His declarations are those of a human being who expressed solidarity to a people that's being massacred. We appreciate it very much,\" Nabil said.\n\nSheikh Abu Yahya, a Mexican-born community leader who converted to Islam 12 years ago, told Arab News this is \"the most difficult Ramadan. Our community in (the city of) Leon is formed by Mexican converts and by Muslims from Arab countries. We're all equally sad.\"\n\nHe said the community has been focusing on \"developing empathy and suffering together with those who are suffering, so prayers for the Palestinians have been constant.\"\n\nAbu Yahya added: \"We decided to take part in the local pro-Palestinian committee. We've been taking part in several activities and sharing information about Palestine.\"\n\nHe said amid pro-Israel campaigns in the Mexican media, many Mexicans do not have adequate information about what is happening in Gaza.\n\n\"That's noticeable during our lectures, but when people discover the reality, they express their solidarity with the Palestinians,\" he added.\n\nMany Latin Americans have been receiving information and images of the victims in Gaza via social media, which has been impacting the perceptions of a growing number of people in the region.\n\n\"The war doesn't spare anyone, and hunger is undoubtedly the worst way of dying. That's why it's impossible not to think about Gazans during Ramadan,\" said Shakerat.",

        "body": "After days of refusing to comment on a controversy surrounding a member of his leadership team, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson broke his silence on 25 Ward Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, showing support for the two-term alderman.\n\n\"I don't even know why this is being debated, quite frankly. It's actually quite disturbing that as a city we are having a conversation about protective speech in America,\" Johnson said while touring a Chinatown apartment complex receiving a multi-million dollar federal grant.\n\nSigcho-Lopez was called out Wednesday by a group of aldermen and veterans after photos surfaced of him speaking in front of a burned American flag, after it was burned at the same event by a protester.\n\n\"We are not accusing him of violating any constitutional right, but we are saying is his conduct, his speech was reprehensible to a point where we are demanding he give account for his actions,\" 29 Ward Alderman Chris Taliaferro said.\n\nHe and eight other City Council members have signed a letter to the mayor demanding he remove Sigcho-Lopez from his position as Chairman of the City Council's Housing and Real Estate Committee.\n\nSpeaking to NBC Chicago political editor Mary Ann Ahern on Wednesday, Sigcho-Lopez said he wasn't there to witness the flag burning while doubling down on why he attended the event, which called for both an end to the U.S. funding of Israel amid their war with Hamas and the cancellation of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this summer.\n\n\"They want me to apologize for something that I wasn't witness of. I cannot apologize for something I didn't do,\" Sigcho-Lopez said.\n\nJohnson said that Sigcho-Lopez was qualified for his leadership team while slamming the City Council members calling for his ouster.\n\n\"Under my administration, I fully expect that the City Council recognizes its responsibility and that it will not move forward in the type of fascist forms of expression that have left too many of our country in desperate peril,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe dissenting aldermen are calling for a special meeting of the City Council to discuss the Sigcho-Lopez incident sometime next week.",

        "title": "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson defends alderman for charred American flag incident, says censure would be 'fascist'",
        "body": "CHICAGO -- Mayor Brandon Johnson on Thursday delivered an impassioned defense of ally Ald. Bryon Sigcho-Lopez's appearance last week in front of a scorched American flag and dismissed calls by other City Council members to have Sigcho-Lopez removed as head of a powerful council committee.\n\nWhile saying he thinks other aldermen will stop short of censuring Sigcho-Lopez because it is a \"fascist\" form of expression, the mayor also took care to avoid weighing in on the progressive alderman's criticism of President Joe Biden and agreement with protesters that the Democratic National Convention in Chicago should be canceled.\n\nJohnson said that \"one of the core elements of democracy is actually having the First Amendment\" when asked about Sigcho-Lopez speaking in front of a charred American flag at a pro-Palestinian rally outside City Hall this past Friday.\n\nThe mayor then compared the situation to one faced by Barack Obama when he was first running for president in 2008. At the time, excerpts of sermons by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's then-pastor, were publicized, including remarks in which Wright blasted the U.S. government for dishonesty, shouted \"God damn America\" and accused the government of creating AIDS.\n\n\"As far as people taking offense to someone's presentation, I remember when President Obama was being ridiculed because of comments that his pastor made in the pulpit,\" Johnson said. \"Do we really want to have a society where someone's comments, or someone else's comments that happened to be in the presence of someone else, that that becomes a repudiation of that particular person? I would find that to be morally reprehensible and irresponsible.\"\n\nThough it was noted that Obama ultimately denounced the comments and later left Trinity United Church of Christ, Johnson reiterated the American right to protected speech. He also did not comment on questions surrounding Sigcho-Lopez's views or association with the group that held the protest calling for the DNC in Chicago, where Biden is expected to be renominated this summer, to be canceled.\n\nSigcho-Lopez, 25th, has parroted those calls about the DNC, saying the event should be canceled in protest of the federal government's response to the migrant humanitarian crisis that has affected Chicago and other cities. Photos from the rally show the charred flag in front of Sigcho-Lopez's feet. It was set on fire by a Marine veteran who once flew it while on tour in Afghanistan and was protesting the Biden administration's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, according to organizers.\n\nSigcho-Lopez's appearance at the protest and his comments at it have angered nearly a dozen council colleagues, who demanded Johnson remove Sigcho-Lopez as head of the Housing and Real Estate Committee and announced plans to hold a special City Council meeting Monday where Sigcho-Lopez could be censured. Though committee chair assignments require City Council approval, Chicago mayors, including Johnson, have traditionally exerted a de-facto power to handpick their choices.\n\nJohnson on Thursday rejected the demand by the 11 aldermen, saying Sigcho-Lopez was \"qualified\" to chair the Housing Committee and was \"fighting for affordable housing.\"\n\n\"If people are as petulant as someone who would be unwilling to engage with someone that they disagree with, we wouldn't be standing here today,\" Johnson said. \"Do you know how many conversations Black leaders have had to have with racists? It's multiple, right? People have a right, though I may disagree with this particular presentation, if people want to march through the streets -- and they have -- with nooses and other forms of objects that would be offensive to people, I can be offended, but also understand the fundamental value of this country.\"\n\n...continued",

        "title": "The Pope's Exorcist Star Russell Crowe Teases Concept Could Become a Trilogy",
        "body": "It looks like there may be plenty more horrifying adventures for the Pope's Exorcist in the future. Last year, director Julius Avery's The Pope's Exorcist made a bit of a splash in theaters, earning over $77 million on a budget of just $18 million. Shortly after that, Sony and Screen Gems began development on a sequel to the Russell Crowe vehicle. There has been little talk about a second Pope's Exorcist since then, but Crowe is confident that ball will begin rolling again soon.\n\nSpeaking to The Six O'Clock Show, Crowe was asked about the future of The Pope's Exorcist. He explained that the original plan was actually to create an entire trilogy of films, and he still wants to do that. The only issue at the moment is a changing of the guard at the studio, which has kept things from moving forward as quickly as initially planned.\n\n\"Well that's in discussion at the moment,\" Crowe began. \"The producers originally got the kick off from the studio not just for one sequel but for two. But there's been a change of studio heads at the moment, so that's going around in a few circles. But very definitely, man. We set that character up that you could take him out and put him into a lot of different circumstances. And remember, the man that's based on, Gabriele Amorth, he wrote 12 books. So we have more than enough source material to do one or two more of those films. But that probably won't be until next year.\"\n\nThat last bit is certainly the most exciting for fans of The Pope's Exorcist. According to Crowe, things will get moving again as soon as next year, which could mean that we aren't too far away from seeing Father Amorth back on the big screen.\n\nThe Pope's Exorcist also does a good job of setting itself up for sequels, as the film ends with Gabriele learning that the demonic location he had been dealing with throughout the story was actually just one of 100 around the globe. That set him and his new partner on a quest to go stop more evil from spreading to our world, leaving things completely wide open for sequels.\n\nAre you hoping to see more Pope's Exorcist movies in the future? Let us know in the comments!",

        "body": "The field of forensic psychology is a fascinating one. It's amazing how criminal and sociopathic behavior betrays itself with a look, a gesture, the tensing of a single muscle. In the case of Donald Trump, there is no lack of opportunity to study him, or members of his family, in the act of lying. As a matter of fact, the Art Of The Lie or Art Of The Con should have been Trump's real signature piece, not Art Of The Deal. Trump wouldn't have filed for bankruptcy six times and be on the precipice of a seventh if he knew the first thing about business or deal making. Here's his latest con, which he's enjoying a lot, selling Bibles during Holy Week. The Pope himself is physically ill right now, I daresay.\n\nHere are a few more pertinent additions to this story, for your viewing pleasure.\n\nAnother poet in our midst, this Rector Hendrickson. Trump is no more a man of God and religion than he is a five-star cordon bleu chef -- unless they eat McDonald's when not in the kitchen whipping up transcendent versions of classic recipes. Trump is a con on every level but nowhere is it more disgusting than when he claims to be a Xian. And the fact that some people fall for it is simply and utterly beyond me. How did we get to be so empty and clueless as a culture that anybody in this country falls for this bullshit artist?\n\nAnd I am not joking when I say Trump will do something even more blasphemous during the Easter holiday. He's on a roll here. He's desperate and he needs money, and he's probably as nervous as hell since Truth Social stock plunged today and closed down several points.\n\nPut nothing past this man. Like a wounded animal is the most dangerous, so is a cornered Trump. He'll stop at nothing to line his pockets, especially as he gets read for his first criminal trial in two and a half weeks.",

        "title": "Emergency departments prove fertile ground for smoking cessation success",
        "body": "By Hugo Francisco de SouzaMar 28 2024Reviewed by Benedette Cuffari, M.Sc.\n\nIn a recent study published in the Emergency Medicine Journal, researchers discuss the outcomes of the Cessation of Smoking Trial in the Emergency Department (COSTED) study, which aimed to understand the optimal intervention and long-term outcomes of emergency department (ED)-based smoking cessation interventions.\n\nStudy: Cessation of Smoking Trial in the Emergency Department (COSTED): a multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Image Credit: rangizzz / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe dangers of smoking and the untapped potential of the ED\n\nTobacco consumption, which is generally in the form of smoking, is responsible for about eight million deaths each year and, as a result, is the leading cause of human mortality worldwide. Research in the United Kingdom has revealed that 22% of its 6.4 million smoking citizens belong to the 'routine and manual' occupations segment, whereas 8.3% belong to the 'managerial and professional' occupational cohort.\n\nReducing the global dependency on tobacco and tobacco products is one of the highlights of modern medicine, with addiction treatment presenting a potent intervention against premature death, oversaturation of the healthcare system, and health inequalities. EDs present a viable and untapped setting for implementing anti-tobacco interventions, as these departments see large numbers of individuals, many of whom smoke and experience complex health inequalities.\n\nPreviously, smoking cessation interventions have been tested in ED settings with generally favorable outcomes. However, current challenges to the widespread implementation of these methodologies are due to these trials having only evaluated behavioral support or a combination of behavioral support and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), particularly in populations already motivated to quit smoking.\n\nRecent research and anecdotal evidence suggest that e-cigarettes are more potent anti-tobacco addiction tools than NRTs; however, their effectiveness has never been formally tested. Thus, understanding the real-world and long-term effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions carried out in ED settings and involving e-cigarette use may help millions of people worldwide reduce the prevalence of tobacco smoking in the future.\n\nAbout the study\n\nThe present study aims to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of an ED-based smoking cessation intervention as compared to usual care. The effectiveness of e-cigarette starter kits in reducing smoking as compared to their absence was also investigated.\n\nThe COSTED study is a multicenter, parallel-group, and computer-randomized controlled trial involving six UK National Health Service (NHS) EDs. The study included adults 18 years and older who were either admitted to an NHS ED or accompanying someone who was.\n\nStudy participants were identified during routine ED screening and included those who reported daily tobacco use and excluded individuals who exhaled less than eight parts per million (ppm) of carbon monoxide (CO) or were currently using both traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes daily. Identified individuals who provided informed consent were then enrolled in the study and computer-randomized into either the intervention or control cohort.\n\nThe intervention cohort was provided a 15-minute long smoking cessation session with a dedicated smoking cessation advisor, an e-cigarette starter kit along with detailed instructions on its use, and an electronic referral to a local smoking cessation center. Comparatively, individuals in the control group were provided with written cessation advice but no further intervention.\n\nStudy outcomes, which included self-reported and biochemically measured smoking abstinence, were measured during routine questionnaires and ED-based follow-ups conducted one, three, and six months following participant randomization. Risk estimates and differences in outcomes between cohorts were calculated using binary regression models, including fixed effects and Gaussian models with robust variances.\n\nStudy findings\n\nIndividuals in the intervention cohort were significantly more likely to quit smoking and remain tobacco-free longer than those in the control group. Although the biochemically verified smoking quit rate was not as high as expected, self-reported abstinence, which was defined as six or fewer relapses over the course of the six-month-long study, was higher than expected. These results suggest that biochemical results, both from this and previous studies, are likely underestimates of the true potential contribution of EDs in smoking cessation efforts.\n\nThe ED represents an acceptable location for smoking cessation intervention and therefore offers a valuable opportunity to engage those who smoke who are not currently seeking to quit.\"\n\nPolicy implications and conclusions\n\nThe study findings demonstrate the effectiveness of simple and opportunistic smoking cessation interventions provided in real-world ED settings. Self-reported daily tobacco users showed significant reductions in smoking dependency and use following a brief 15-minute-long counseling session with a dedicated smoking cessation advisor, an e-cigarette starter kit, and digital referral to a local stop-smoking service, particularly when compared to controls who only received text-based cessation advice and stop-smoking services referral.\n\nThose attending EDs are generally from more deprived communities and more likely to smoke than the general population. Therefore, this intervention has the potential to address health inequalities that arise from disparities in smoking rates between different socioeconomic groups.\"\n\nJournal reference: Pope, I., Clark, L.

We will put safety and quality above all else in order to meet and exceed the expectations of our regulators, customers, flying public and each other,\" Pope said.\n\nShe said over next couple of weeks, she \"will be spending my time meeting and engaging with our team as we enhance and implement our safety and quality improvement plan.\"\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said earlier the agency and Boeing hope by the end of March to define the milestones the manufacturer must meet.

Previously, popes performed the ritual on Catholic men only at a Rome basilica.\n\nFrancis has traveled each year to a prison, refugee center or youth detention facility to emphasize his belief that a priest's vocation is to serve especially those most on the margins.

During the morning liturgy, he delivered a lengthy homily with a set of marching orders to Rome-based priests at the start of a busy few days leading to Easter.\n\nFrancis has been hobbled by a long bout of respiratory problems this winter and in recent weeks has asked an aide to read aloud his remarks to spare him the strain. On Palm Sunday, he skipped his homily altogether.\n\nBut Francis seemed energized by his visit to the Rebibbia prison, where he was given a basket of vegetables grown in the prison garden as well as two liturgical stoles embroidered by the inmates.\n\nFrancis, for his part, regifted a framed image of the Madonna that he had been given, saying as soon as he received it he thought of the women at Rebibbia. He also gave a big chocolate Easter egg to the young son of one of the inmates.\n\nEven with Holy Thursday events wrapped up, Francis has a busy few days coming up that will test his stamina.\n\nOn Friday, he is due to travel at night to the Colosseum for the Way of the Cross procession re-enacting Christ's crucifixion. On Saturday, he presides over an evening Easter Vigil in St. Peter's Basilica followed a few hours later by Easter Sunday Mass in the piazza and his big noontime Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) speech highlighting global conflicts and disasters afflicting humanity.\n\nClose\n\nPope Francis celebrates the Holy Chrism Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, at The Vatican, Thursday, March 28, 2024.

        "title": "The Philippines Announces Plans to Counter Chinese Coast Guard Attacks",
        "body": "By submitting your email, you agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use and to receive email correspondence from us. You may opt out at any time.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced plans on Thursday to implement new countermeasures against what he called \"illegal, coercive, aggressive, and dangerous attacks\" by China's coast guard in the South China Sea. \"We seek no conflict with any nation, more so nations that purport and claim to be our friends,\" Marcos wrote on Facebook, \"but we will not be cowed into silence, submission, or subservience.\"\n\nMarcos did not specify what the countermeasures would entail, only that they would be \"proportionate, deliberate, and reasonable\" to Beijing's attacks. However, two Philippine security officials told The Associated Press that advisors recommended Manila use faster military vessels instead of chartered civilian ships when delivering personnel and supplies to naval forces stationed on the Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nThe shoal is a submerged reef in the South China Sea that is hotly contested by both China and the Philippines, among other countries. Since the late 1990s, the Philippines has stationed a small contingent of naval forces on a ship that it intentionally marooned on the shoal to serve as a territorial outpost. In 2016, The Hague's Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in a case filed by Manila that China's historic claim to the area has no legal basis. Beijing, however, continues to reject the tribunal's ruling. China has previously sent coast guard and maritime militia ships to surround the shoal to prevent Philippine resupply boats from reaching the marooned vessel, which remains an actively commissioned Philippine naval ship.\n\nThis has led to repeated hostilities between Chinese and Philippine vessels, including last Saturday, when China's coast guard fired water cannons on a Philippine resupply ship, injuring three crew members. Beijing called the operation a \"lawful regulation, interception, and expulsion\" of a foreign vessel that \"tried to forcefully intrude\" into Chinese waters. On Thursday, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian blamed Manila for the two countries' breakdown in ties and accused the Philippines of spreading \"misinformation to mislead the international community.\"\n\nForeign governments have condemned China's recent actions. On Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called Beijing's operation \"dangerous\" and reaffirmed Washington's commitment to the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, which says the United States and the Philippines will defend each other if one comes under attack, including in the South China Sea.\n\nUnlike Marcos's predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who prioritized economic cooperation with Beijing, Marcos has pursued a harsher China policy and pivoted closer to the United States. Last year, Marcos granted Washington greater access to Philippine military bases and expanded joint exercises over the South China Sea. Regional experts have linked the Philippines' deteriorating relations with Beijing to its deepening ties with Washington.\n\nColombia-Argentina spat. Bogot\u00e1 ordered the expulsion of several Argentine diplomats on Wednesday after Argentine President Javier Milei called his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, a \"murdering terrorist\" during a CNN interview, appearing to reference Petro's time as a member of the long-disbanded M-19 guerrilla group. Milei's comments \"have deteriorated the trust of our nation, in addition to offending the dignity of President Petro, who was democratically elected,\" the Colombian Foreign Ministry said. It did not specify how many diplomats Bogot\u00e1 would remove.\n\nMilei is known for publicly criticizing world leaders. During the same interview, he called Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \"ignorant,\" and last year, Milei described Pope Francis as an \"imbecile who defends social justice.\" In January, Colombia recalled its ambassador to Argentina after Milei referred to Petro as a \"murderous communist who is sinking Colombia.\"\n\n\"Legitimate targets.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Moscow has no plans to attack any NATO country, including Poland, the Baltic states, or the Czech Republic. However, he added that Russian forces will shoot down any F-16 fighters that the West sends to Ukraine. \"Of course, if they will be used from airfields in third countries, they become for us legitimate targets, wherever they might be located,\" Putin said.\n\nNATO countries have previously suggested various levels of direct engagement with Russia in its war against Ukraine. Last August, the Netherlands and Denmark announced plans to deliver 42 F-16 warplanes to Ukraine, and this February, French President Emmanuel Macron said alliance members should not rule out deploying Western troops to Kyiv.\n\nTogo's parliamentary future. Opposition and clergy leaders in Togo called for mass protests on Wednesday to urge President Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 not to approve a new constitution. The text, passed by lawmakers on Monday, would give parliament the power to select the president, scrapping direct elections. Under the new constitution, Togo's president would only serve one six-year term, and a new position similar to a prime minister (known as the president of the council of ministers) would serve for six years with no term limits.\n\nSome critics fear that removing direct elections could result in Gnassingb\u00e9 being reelected after his mandate expires in 2025, thereby allowing him to extend his rule; he has already served almost 20 years as Togo's president. Opponents believe Gnassingb\u00e9 may also cement his hold on power if he seeks the role of president of the council of ministers.\n\nMacron and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva are setting the gold standard for friendship goals. During a three-day diplomatic meeting in Brazil this week, the world leaders took time to stage a heartwarming photoshoot, including shots of them traipsing through the rainforest and holding hands on a boat. The pictures went viral on social media after some users wrote that the elated duo looked like they were on a \"whirlwind honeymoon\" or enjoying a \"pre-wedding shoot.\"",

        "title": "Dragon Ball: Universe 7's Team Is Looking Unbeatable",
        "body": "Since the Tournament of Power, Universe 7's team has only gotten stronger, to the point where none of the other universes may be able to compete.\n\nHighlights\n\nGoku, Vegeta, and Gohan have unlocked powerful new transformations that put them on levels never seen before in Dragon Ball Super. With Universe 7's team now boasting Ultra Instinct, Ultra Ego, Beast, and Orange Piccolo, they may surpass the strengths of other universes. The addition of Granolah, Majin Buu, Gotenks, and the Androids in support roles could make Universe 7's team an unstoppable force in the tournament of power.\n\nWhen the Dragon Ball Super anime went on an indefinite hiatus in 2017, it was right after the much-loved Tournament of Power arc had reached its conclusion. This arc was praised by fans and critics alike, as it showed the Z-Fighters going up against some of the strongest warriors from across the multiverse, culminating in Ultra Instinct Goku's legendary battle against Jiren the Grey, who was the most powerful antagonist that the heroes had ever faced up till that point.\n\nHowever, despite seeing how strong the other universes are, Universe 7's current team may just be far out of everyone else's league. Over the years, the official Dragon Ball Super manga has introduced many new transformations for the main characters that bring them to levels never heard of before and has even introduced new characters that are just as powerful. So, let's take a look at why Universe 7's team for the second Tournament of Power may just be too strong.\n\nRelated Will Dragon Ball Super Return? Dragon Ball Super's hiatus didn't exactly take people by surprise, but will it actually make a return or should fans say goodbye to the series?\n\nGoku's Ultra Instinct Is Stronger Than Ever\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nDragon Ball Super, Episode 110, \"Goku Enkindled! The Awakened One's New Ultra Instinct!\"\n\nDebut Date\n\nOctober 7, 2017\n\nAwakened in his incredible fight against Jiren in the Tournament of Power, Ultra Instinct is a technique of the Angels that provides the perfect defense by having the body move out of danger on its own. Though activated multiple times throughout the tournament, it wasn't until their last fight that Goku unlocked a mastered version of the form which allowed him to defeat Jiren without breaking a sweat. After the tournament, Goku would eventually go on to master the transformation and honed his body to use Mastered Ultra Instinct perfectly.\n\nIt's an ultimate technique that severs the consciousness from the body in order to allow the body to subconsciously move it to even attack or evade. It's called 'Ultra Instinct'.\n\nNotable Feats:\n\nIn his Ultra Instinct form, he made short work of Jiren the Grey, an extremely powerful enemy who no one else could harm. After that, he mastered the form to fight against Moro, even unlocking a brand-new Spirit Avatar move that formed a massive specter of energy, which he used once more against Gas in the Granolah arc. In this arc, Mastered and True Ultra Instinct allowed Goku to fight on equal footing against both antagonists, who were each the strongest character in Universe 7 at different points.\n\nClose\n\nVegeta's Ultra Ego Has The Power Of Gods\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nDragon Ball Super, Chapter 74, \"Vegeta vs. Granolah\"\n\nDebut Date\n\nJuly 20, 2021\n\nWhen Goku achieved Ultra Instinct, fans waited for the time when Vegeta would unlock it too, as the trend had been like this for quite a while. However, in the Granolah arc, Vegeta eventually unlocks an incredible transformation of his own, gaining the Energy of Destruction and the aura of a Destroyer God with his awesome Ultra Ego form. This form was a great addition to Vegeta's character because it fit him perfectly due to his nature as a brawler and his strength in this form was staggering, with him using its unique attribute to get stronger with more damage that he took, prioritizing brawling instead of finesse like Ultra Instinct.\n\nA God of Destruction taught me that power derived solely from instinct is unbounded.\n\nNotable Feats:\n\nThe only showing of Ultra Ego thus far has been brief. However, its strength was quite apparent as Vegeta overpowered Granolah at the start of their fight, which is impressive because the latter was a character who was able to knock out Ultra Instinct Goku in one attack. After the Cerelians power up, it was revealed that the only way for him to truly defeat Vegeta is in a massive attack that would kill him too, and later on, Vegeta used this form to fight against Gas pretty well, showing how strong it truly is.\n\nClose\n\nGohan Beast Is Equal To Ultra Instinct\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nDragon Ball Super: Super Hero\n\nDebut Date\n\nJune 11, 2022\n\nThe events of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie introduced a terrifying new threat in Cell Max, who was shown to be an incredibly powerful villain. Despite getting significant power-ups and the whole team of Z-Fighters working together, they still couldn't bring the monster down until Gohan unlocked his amazing new Beast transformation. Awoken from his unmatched potential and rage, Beast swiftly dealt with Cell Max and finally answered fans' desires to have Gohan reach the same tier of strength as Goku and Vegeta.\n\nIs that all? I guess it's my turn.\n\nNotable Feats:\n\nThe only concrete evidence that fans have of Cell Max's power is when Gohan states that he isn't sure if even Goku or Vegeta could have beaten him, so seeing him take the monster down with a single attack tells how powerful he is. Moreover, Chapter 103 of the manga revealed the true strength of Gohan Beast, as he matched Ultra Instinct blow for blow and even took Goku by surprise with his blistering speed. Though perhaps not stronger than UI, landing such a clean hit on the form definitely puts him on the same level as it.\n\nClose Related Dragon Ball: Best Mentors, Ranked The Dragon Team has been aided by a host of immensely powerful teachers during their adventures. These are the best among them.\n\nOrange Piccolo Is Perhaps The Strongest Namekian Ever\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nDragon Ball Super: Super Hero\n\nDebut Date\n\nJune 11, 2022\n\nSuper Hero received praise for not only bringing Gohan back to relevance, but Piccolo as well. The Namekian had been left in the dust by the Saiyans, so he made a wish to Shenron to make him strong enough to compete with them, which was answered by the incredible Orange Piccolo transformation. This form was so strong that it made short work of Gamma #2 without any real effort and even went toe-to-toe against Cell Max, holding him down for Gohan to deal the finishing blow.\n\nI turned orange? Really? I didn't even notice. But it felt like some switch inside me got flipped, the same way it does with you.\n\nNotable Feats:\n\nWhen Gamma #2 attacked him at the start of the movie, Piccolo was easily overpowered by him, and Gamma #1's fight against Ultimate Gohan proved that these new androids were at the same level as the Saiyan. After unlocking his orange form, Piccolo defeated Gamma #2 with just a single punch that effectively made most of the Red Ribbon Army surrender then and there. Moreover, he fought against Cell Max fairly equally for much of their bout.\n\nClose\n\nBroly Can Unleash His Unrivaled Potential\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nDragon Ball Super: Broly\n\nDebut Date\n\nDecember 14, 2018\n\nBroly is more akin to a force of nature than just any other Saiyan. Due to his harsh and lonely living conditions, the only person he had ever known before the events of the movie was his father Paragus, who had brought him up with the sole purpose of bringing down the Saiyan royal family. Broly held unparalleled potential within himself, as he could raise his power to unquantified degrees and overpower pretty much anyone who faced him, though this came at the price of him losing his mind to his rage and becoming a destructive monster.\n\nI was so sure my strength was getting close to its peak, and then this guy showed up and was so much stronger than me. And he's a Saiyan, just like I am. He's probably even stronger than Beerus!\n\nNotable Feats:\n\nIn his first ever proper fight against opponents other than his father, Broly's power rose exponentially, eventually coming to a stage where he surpassed even Goku and Vegeta's Super Saiyan Blue transformations. These were extremely powerful forms that the Saiyans had been working to master for decades, but Broly surpassed them within a day. Though his rage has always been a problem for him, Chapter 103 sees him finally reign it in and unlock a Super Saiyan form strong enough to spar equally with Beast Gohan.\n\nClose Related Dragon Ball: Beerus' Sphere of Destruction, Explained Beerus' Sphere of Destruction is one of the many things that sets him apart from most Dragon Ball characters. Here's a closer look at how it works.\n\nVarious Others In Support Roles\n\nThe characters that have already been mentioned are the heavy hitters on the team for sure. However, the rest of Universe 7's team would be incredibly strong and would consist of fighters who, although perhaps not as powerful as these 5, would be indispensable to the overall success of the team in various support roles. These could be:\n\nGranolah: Granolah proved himself to be an incredibly powerful combatant in the arc sharing his name, so much so that he, at full power, was equal to Vegeta's Ultra Ego in strength and played a vital role with the 2 Saiyans in defeating Gas. Granolah's role in the team could make use of his exceptional abilities as a sniper, taking out powerful enemies from afar. Majin Buu: Before the Tournament of Power began, it was revealed that Buu had unlocked a new form that was stronger than any of his previous ones, but he couldn't use it because he fell asleep. Buu could lend a protective support role to Granolah as he fired from afar. Gotenks: Though Goten and Trunks may not be as strong as most of the other fighters on the team, having a fused Saiyan would be very useful. By perfecting their fusion, Goten and Trunks can finally have a bigger role to play in the overall story. The Androids: The Androids are honestly pretty weak compared to the other characters here, but having infinite energy and stamina is always a plus. Gamma #1, Android 18, and 17 could all prove to be very helpful in this tournament. Related Dragon Ball: How Much Has Yamcha Changed Since the Emperor Pilaf Saga? Yamcha's role throughout Dragon Ball has varied since his introduction in the Emperor Pilaf Saga. How much has he changed since then?\n\nThe Ultimate Wildcard\n\nWhether or not Black Frieza would be on the team is the biggest question mark for the whole situation. If Frieza were to be on the team, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that Universe 7 would leave all other universes in the dust. In fact, if Frieza saw fit to join Universe 7 once more, this team might just be strong enough to challenge the Gods of Destruction and the Divine Hierarchy itself!\n\nHowever, there is no way to know what will happen until the situation presents itself within the canon story. Knowing how devious and cunning the Galactic Tyrant is, it's not too far to assume that Frieza would somehow find his way to being on the team of a different universe, spelling real trouble for the heroes!\n\nDragon Ball can be streamed on Crunchyroll.\n\nMore Dragon Ball: Every Shadow Dragon, Explained Each Shadow Dragon brought something different to the table.

        "title": "Dragon Ball Super Artist Reveals Akira Toriyama's Final Suggestion",
        "body": "Toriyama's last Dragon Ball Super manga suggestion now serves as a final heartfelt goodbye to his fans.\n\nThe artist behind the Dragon Ball Super manga revealed series creator Akira Toriyama's final suggestion for what may be the manga's last chapter for the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to Anime News Network, Dragon Ball Super announced the series' hiatus following Toriyama's passing on March 1. Dragon Ball Super's hiatus makes sense when you take into consideration that Toriyama served as a supervisor to Toyotarou and would often give input on the manga's drafts. While it's unknown when the manga will continue its serialization, Toyotarou shared Toriyama's final suggestion for chapter 103.\n\nDragon Ball Super chapter 103, A Legacy Toward The Future, ostensibly bookends the aftermath of the 2022 Gohan and Piccolo-centric 3DCG-animated animated film, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero. The 45-page chapter starts off as a Saiyan battle extravaganza. The chapter features a sparring match between an Ultra Instinct Goku and Beast Mode Gohan and a skirmish between Gohan and Broly before escalating into a free-for-all adding Vegeta, Goten, and Trunks into the mix.\n\nHowever, the thematic throughline of the chapter, as its title lampshades, centers on Goku entrusting the next generation of heroes to defend the Earth after he passes on. This culminates with Goku meeting up with his granddaughter (whom he forgot existed), Pan. Luckily for her, Pan is being mentored by Goku's first major rival, Piccolo. just like her father was. The final moments of the chapter sees Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, and Pan fly off toward what's likely to be yet another grand adventure.\n\nIn an X/Twitter post, Toyotaro uploaded a side-by-side recreation of his draft of the chapter's final page and Toriyama's suggestion. In Toyotraou's version, Piccolo and company fly into the sky with their backs facing the reader. Toriyama's suggestion, which transpires in chapter 103, instead sees Piccolo turn around and wave goodbye to Pan's kindergarten teacher, Janet, before joining the Saiyans.\n\nFans were quick to point out that Toriyama's suggestion -- while providing Piccolo moments of characterization and shipping fuel with Janet -- also meta-narratively serves as the Namekian saying goodbye to Dragon Ball Super's readers on Toriyama's behalf. This fan-crafted revelation of Toriyama's final suggestion hits home all the harder when you take into account that Piccolo was his favorite character.\n\n\"Mr. Toriyama. Thank you very much for your hard work. It's been 9 years since we worked together,\" Toyotarou wrote. \"It was a miraculous time. Thank you very much. I humbly pray for your soul to rest in peace.\"\n\nIsaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN. You can follow them on Twitter @ShinEyeZehUhh.",

        "title": "Anime and manga strongarm their way into the Oxford dictionary as 'Isekai' and 'Mangaka' become official English words",
        "body": "English-speaking manga and anime enjoyers just received a powerful dose of validation, as two words inextricably linked to the scene have just made their way into the language's main historical dictionary.\n\nEarlier this week, Oxford University Press announced that 23 new Japanese words had been added to the 500 or so loanwords that already feature in the Oxford English Dictionary. Many of those were food-related - such as Katsu, Hibachi, Santoku, or Tonkotsu - and a few others pertained to specific crafts. Kintsugi, for instance, is the well-known Japanese art of fusing broken objects back together with gold, while Kirigami is not too distant from the world-famous art of Origami.\n\nAlso included in the list of craft words, however, is Mangaka. Defined simply as \"a writer or illustrator of manga,\" it's interesting to see the increased presence that mangaka themselves have had in mainstream culture in recent years. Sadly, in many of those cases, it's been the artists' deaths that have marked that change, with the passing of Berserk mangaka Kentaro Miura in 2021, and the recent death of Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama.\n\nElsewhere, the list of words includes Tokukatsu - \"a genre of Japanese film or television entertainment characterized by the use of practical special effects.\" Of those, classic Godzilla films or shows like Power Rangers are likely best known. But one other word in particular caught my eye: Isekai. Defined here as \"a Japanese genre of science or fantasy fiction featuring a protagonist who is transported to or reincarnated in a different, strange, or unfamiliar world,\" the concept is a pivotal framework for untold numbers of anime, manga, novels, and more, which have taken over the fantasy space in the last decade.\n\nIsekai is not an inherently Japanese concept - Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan, and The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe all use very similar ideas - but the format is especially ubiquitous within anime and manga, helping the word gain a greater footing in popular culture within the West. Of course, the popularity of Japanese art is not a new phenomenon outside of Japan - the Oxford English Dictionary has been aware of the word 'anime' since 1985 - but as that popularity grows, it's interesting to see specific aspects of the scene gain a foothold in increasingly varied places.",

        "body": "A manga fan on Twitter (@BasedPota18) has shared the final page of published art worked on by Dragon Ball creator and legendary mangaka Akira Toriyama. The page - the last in this month's Dragon Ball Super Chapter 103 - marks a bittersweet farewell to one of the greatest manga creators of all time.\n\nOn the page, Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo arrive to collect Pan, Goku's young granddaughter from kindergarten. As they walk away, Piccolo turns and offers a friendly wave that appears to be to the reader. As several posters have pointed out it feels, touchingly, like a farewell from Akira Toriyama himself.\n\nThe page draws extra resonance as it is known that former villain Piccolo was Toriyama's favorite character in the long-running series.\n\nWhile Toriyama stopped drawing full pages some years ago, he continued to write Dragon Ball Super, while also providing guidance and artistic corrections to his successor, fellow mangaka Toyotarou. Toyotarou has since confirmed on his own Twitter that the addition of Piccolo turning and waving is indeed one such alteration, sketched in by Toriyama himself. You can see his corrections in the tweet below.\n\nThe page also included a tribute attributed to the English language team on Dragon Ball Super. It reads: \"We're all deeply saddened by the news of Toriyama sensei's passing. His work is an inspiration to us all. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all the fans who were touched by his work.\"\n\nA notice on the side of the page explains that the series will be on hiatus after April's issue, though it doesn't say how long for.\n\nMeanwhile, another Toriyama project, Sand Land, has recently made its debut as an anime series, quickly gaining high praise from fans and critics. That show is streaming now on Disney Plus and Hulu.",

Toyotarou described Toriyama's alteration as akin to \"Piccolo saying goodbye to his kindergarten teacher.\"\n\nUser SupaChronicles, who provided the translation of Toyotarou's post, highlighted the artist's gratitude towards Toriyama, quoting him as saying,\n\n\"So it was not with that intention that I drew Piccolo. But I can't help but add another meaning to it. Toriyama-sensei, thank you very much for your hard work. To think that I was able to work with you for 9 years is like a miracle.\" Toyotarou concluded the thread with a heartfelt tribute, stating, \"Thank you very much. I pray for the repose of your soul.\"\n\nAkira Toriyama, the mastermind behind the Dragon Ball franchise since its inception in 1984, commenced his manga career with the renowned series Dr. Slump in 1980.\n\nHis artistic talent extended beyond manga to character design for various video games, including Blue Dragon, the Dragon Quest series, and Chrono Trigger. Dragon Ball itself emerged from Toriyama's earlier work, Dragon Boy, serialized in 1983. Toriyama passed away on March 1 at the age of 68 due to an acute subdural hematoma.\n\nIn the aftermath of Toriyama's demise, an outpouring of tributes flooded in from creators, artists, and world leaders, underscoring the profound impact of his contributions.\n\nNotably, French President Emmanuel Macron and actor Justin Chatwin, who portrayed Goku in the ill-fated live-action adaptation Dragon Ball: Evolution, paid homage to Toriyama's legacy.\n\nToyotarou, acclaimed for his illustrations in Dragon Ball Super since 2015, embarked on his journey within the Dragon Ball universe with Dragon Ball Heroes: Victory Mission in 2012, an adaptation of the arcade trading card game Super Dragon Ball Heroes.\n\nDespite his extensive involvement in the franchise, Toyotarou's professional endeavors have remained exclusively tied to Dragon Ball, including notable works such as Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' (2015), Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 The Manga (2016), and Super Dragon Ball Heroes: World Mission (2019), where he crafted the character Sealas.",

        "title": "Dragon Ball GT's Strongest Transformations",
        "body": "Dragon Ball GT has a mixed reception among fans, but it still features some powerful and memorable transformations for its characters.\n\nAkira Toriyama's Dragon Ball GT faced an uphill battle as the successor to the extremely popular Dragon Ball Z. Any follow-up series would be subject to scrutiny, but Dragon Ball GT's minimal involvement from Toriyama and its radical pivot towards lighthearted adventures over aggressive action started the anime off on rocky footing. Dragon Ball GT does eventually find a rhythm that works for it. and it's actually been progressively reappraised for its creativity as Dragon Ball Super makes more predictable and safer decisions.\n\nThere are understandable criticisms to be made when it comes to Dragon Ball GT's storytelling and pacing. However, it's dense in unique transformations for both its heroes and villains alike. Transformations continue to be one of Dragon Ball's most celebrated elements and Dragon Ball GT is sure to not deprive its audience in this department. The polarizing anime showcases many transformations that are not just compelling to admire, but also present incredible power.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Related 10 Dragon Ball GT Storylines That Deserve a Second Chance in Dragon Ball Super Dragon Ball GT still has its share of detractors, but it also features some strong ideas that deserve another go in Dragon Ball Super.\n\n10 Mutchy Masquerades As A Simple Weapon Before His True Form Activates\n\nDebut: Episode 11, \"Lord Luud's Curse\"\n\nClose\n\nDragon Ball GT goes quite far with the unusual Machine Mutants that it introduces during its introductory Black Star Dragon Ball Saga. Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy is one of the series' stranger characters and it's easy to completely overlook the individual, since he gets lost in the shuffle as Dragon Ball GT begins to ramp up to Baby. Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy is a dutiful soldier to Luud aand the leader of his cult.\n\nHowever, it's later revealed that there's more than meets the eye with this Machine Mutant. Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy brandishes a whip, which is Mutchy's original form. Once provoked, Mutchy transforms into an intense Xenomorph-esque creature who also uses whips as his primary weapon to help him drain energy and electrify opponents.\n\nDragon Ball GT's original Japanese version states that Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy are separate, yet complementary individuals, whereas the anime's English dub refers to Mutchy as Cardinal Mutchy Mutchy's true from. Mutchy, when he's out of his whip state, is strong enough to take on Super Saiyan Goku, but he's still defeated by base form Trunks. This indicates that while he's powerful for a Machine Mutant, he's never a true threat to the heroes.\n\n9 Level 3 Luud Becomes The Deity That His Followers Have Prophecized\n\nDebut: Episode 13, \"The Man Behind The Curtain\"\n\nClose\n\nAnother threatening Machine Mutant that pushes Goku, Pan, and Trunks out of their comfort zones early on in Dragon Ball GT is Luud, a giant creation who's been praised as a God. Dr. Myuu constructs Luud as a tool to siphon power to his ultimate creation, Baby, but he's still an effective weapon who's protected by a cleverly obscured weak spot.\n\nLuud looks like a giant doll who gains heightened energy if individuals are transferred into his cavernous body. Luud confidently fights in his Level 1 and Level 2 forms, but he reaches full power -- and turns red -- after Pan and Dolltaki are transferred into his body. Level 3 Luud can release a destructive mouth beam, but he still lacks proper intelligence and strategic skills.\n\nThe reason that Level 3 Luud is deemed a stronger transformation than Mutchy's true form is because Luud can only be defeated if a specific cell is simultaneously attacked from both the inside and outside. Goku and Pan coordinate their efforts and reduce Luud to scrap metal.\n\nRelated Every Main Character's Fate at the End of Dragon Ball GT Although Dragon Ball GT is no longer canon, it offers one of the most conclusive endings in the Dragon Ball franchise.\n\n8 Meta-Rilldo Is A Liquid Metal Menace Who Acquires The Power Of A Whole Planet\n\nDebut: Episode 20, \"The Source of Rilldo's Power\"\n\nGeneral Rilldo is one of Dragon Ball GT's most interesting Machine Mutants and his multiple transformations genuinely overwhelm Goku and Pan before Baby steps into the spotlight. General Rilldo is Dr. Myuu's primary fighter and easily strong enough to contend with Super Saiyan Goku's strength. Standard Rilldo is not as strong as Luud, but Rilldo's transformations make him a threat.\n\nGeneral Rilldo first becomes Hyper Meta Rilldo in order to hold his own against Super Saiyan Goku. Rilldo essentially coo-pts pieces from the destroyed Sigma Force and becomes a more formidable threat who's stronger, has a drill hand and can fire off his Hyper Metal-Rilldo Punch.\n\nHyper Meta Rilldo transforms once more into his strongest state, Meta-Rilldo, where he's a being who's made of liquid metal. Meta-Rilldo can control and combine himself with any other metal that's around him, which becomes a major concern on the metallic planet, M-2. Meta-Rilldo weaponizes the entire planet and manages to overwhelm Goku, Pan, and Trunks through this extreme skill and other abilities, like his Metal Breath technique.\n\n7 A Golden Great Ape Takes The Saiyan Staple To Deadly New Heights\n\nDebut: Episode 33, \"The Tail's Tale\"\n\nClose\n\nGreat Ape transformations were around as early as the original Dragon Ball before it was even revealed that Goku is actually a member of an alien race known as the Saiyans. Great Ape transformations - as well as the Saiyans' tails in general - get phased out fairly early on in Dragon Ball Z as the series makes room for endless Super Saiyan variations.\n\nDragon Ball GT circles back to the Great Ape form and develops an even stronger upgrade for it - Golden Great Ape - which is essentially the transformation's Super Saiyan state. Dragon Ball GT treats Golden Great Apes like a mid-way stage before a Saiyan is able to properly ascend to Super Saiyan 4 status. Golden Great Apes possess incredible power and can release ki techniques in addition to their brute strength.\n\nHowever, this transformation is often reckless and unstable, which turns it into a serious liability. A Saiyan's ability to properly rein in and control their Golden Great Ape state typically results in them being rewarded with Super Saiyan 4 power. Only Goku and Vegeta achieve this form in Dragon Ball GT, but it's still a revelatory breakthrough that helps the anime connect the dots with the Saiyans' roots.\n\n6 Majuub Allows Uub To Finally Realize His Full Potential\n\nDebut: Episode 32, \"The Return Of Uub\"\n\nClose\n\nDragon Ball Z ends on a rather surprising note when Goku, stunned by the young Uub's strength and dormant potential, opts to leave his family and friends behind so that he can train the boy and bring out his greatness. Dragon Ball GT begins with the end of Goku and Uub's training.\n\nUnfortunately, Uub gets shelved for dozens of episodes until his help is needed during the heroes' battle against Baby. Uub has learned a lot from Goku, but he's still no match for Golden Great Ape Baby Vegeta. A powerful reunion occurs between Uub and Good Buu, where they recognize that their two pieces of the same whole.\n\nUub absorbs Good Buu, acquires his strength, and becomes Majuub in the process. Majuub doesn't look demonstrably different from Uub other than his distinct vest, but his greater strength is undeniable. Majuub also gains impressive new techniques, like his Chocolate Kamehameha, which can transform targets into candy.\n\nRelated 10 Dragon Ball GT Characters Who Should Have Gone to Space With Goku Instead Dragon Ball GT begins with a bold adventure to space for Goku, Trunks, and Pan, while great characters like Vegeta & Uub were left behind on Earth.\n\n5 Perfect Form Baby Is The Peak Of Neo Machine Mutant Power\n\nDebut: Episode 39, \"Baby Put To Rest\"\n\nClose\n\nBaby is Dr. Myuu's greatest creation and he's committed to get vengeance on the Saiyans for his fallen Tuffle people. Baby successfully takes over most of Earth's population before he settles on Vegeta as his final host. Baby is introduced as an infantile creature who appears to age and grow stronger.\n\nHe experiences greater power boosts while in Vegeta's body as he becomes Super Baby 1, Super Baby 2, and Golden Great Ape Baby Vegeta. This leads to an epic showdown against Super Saiyan 4 Goku that finally pushes Baby to retreat from Vegeta's body after he accepts that he's lost the advantage.\n\nGoku finishes Baby off while he's in his adult Perfect Form, which doesn't get much time to shine on its own, but is responsible for the endless chaos that's caused by Vegeta's Golden Great Ape form. Baby reaches maturity and perfection right before he's taken out by Goku's x10 Kamehameha.\n\n4 Super 17 Is A Frightening Fusion Of Two Intense Androids\n\nDebut: Episode 44, \"17 Times 2\"\n\nClose\n\nDragon Ball GT's Super 17 Saga explores some interesting ideas through the evil possession of Android 17, and colossal jailbreak from hell. It's ultimately one of the anime's messier storylines. Super 17 is the union of Android 17 and Dr. Myuu's Hell Fighter 17.\n\nHe acquires a tremendous power boost that makes him more than capable of taking on Super Saiyan 4 strength. One of Super 17's greatest assets is his ability to absorb energy attacks, like many of Dr. Gero's less-advanced Android models. This helps Super 17 become even stronger, yet this ability also comes with a significant disadvantage.\n\nSince Super 17 is defenseless while in this state, Goku uses this opportunity to destroy him with his debilitating Dragon Fist technique. He's able to devise a smart strategy with Android 18 that helps them avenge Krillin's death. However, Super 17 is still one of the strongest Androids to ever appear in Dragon Ball.\n\n3 True Nuova Shenron Can Humble A Pair Of Super Saiyan 4 Warriors\n\nDebut: Episode 54, \"The Four-Star Dragon\"\n\nClose\n\nDragon Ball GT's seven Shadow Dragons are the embodiment of humanity's selfish and wasteful Dragon Ball wishes. Most of the Shadow Dragons have a separate form that delineates their dragon and humanoid selves, but Nuova Shenron has a more elaborate metamorphosis that feels more aligned with the series' standard transformations.\n\nThe Shadow Dragons represent different elements and techniques, and Nuova Shenron's fire powers and extremely hot temperature are major detriments to his opponents. He also draws power from the sun, which gives him a seemingly unlimited source of energy.\n\nNuvoa Shenron initially fights in a red Heat Armor shell that he rids himself of when he transforms into his golden True Form. True Nuova Shenron is powerful enough to fight against both Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Vegeta. He's one of Dragon Ball GT's strongest characters and a genuine menace who feels dangerous in a way that the previous Shadow Dragons hadn't.\n\nRelated 10 DBZ Characters Who Are Actually Better in Dragon Ball GT Dragon Ball GT remains a controversial chapter in the shonen series, yet it actually improves upon several Dragon Ball Z characters.\n\n2 Omega Shenron Is Syn Shenron's Ultimate Shadow Dragon Gambit\n\nDebut: Episode 58, \"Shadow Dragons Unite\"\n\nClose\n\nSyn Shenron is the seventh and final Shadow Dragon who Goku must face. He serves as Dragon Ball GT's final villain and he certainly doesn't waste this opportunity to solidify his intimidating, evil nature. Syn Shenron makes a bold entrance by executing Nuova Shenron for showing mercy towards Goku and quickly proves himself to be the most unrelenting of the Shadow Dragons.\n\nSyn Shenron asserts control over Goku and the rest of Dragon Ball GT's heroes until Goku taps into a new tier of strength as a Super Full Power Saiyan 4. It's at this point that Syn Shenron consumes the Dragon Balls and evolves into Omega Shenron. Omega Shenron may not look that different from Syn Shenron, but he has the abilities of all the other Shadow Dragons at his disposal.\n\nThis power is too immense for Goku or Vegeta to defeat on their own, so they resort to the fusion dance to become Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta until this winning strategy prematurely ends. Goku is finally able to defeat Omega Shenron with the help of his Super Ultra Spirit Bomb, which puts an end to the Shadow Dragon debacle once and for all. Nevertheless, Omega Shenron's transformation is on a whole other level.\n\n1 Super Saiyan 4 Is Dragon Ball GT's Ultimate Reflection Of Saiyan Strength\n\nDebut: Episode 34, \"Back In The Game\"\n\nClose\n\nSuper Saiyan transformations are always a cause for serious celebration. Nearly three decades after Dragon Ball GT's conclusion, it feels like its Super Saiyan 4 transformation is the greatest legacy that it's left behind. Dragon Ball Super opts for its color-coded Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue evolutions, yet GT's Super Saiyan 4 takes a much bigger swing as it takes the Saiyans back to their origins.\n\nThe red fur aesthetic and prominent tail component definitely helps Super Saiyan 4 stand out from the series' other transformations. This becomes Goku and Vegeta's greatest resource in the series. By tapping into Super Saiyan 4 both Vegeta and Goku are able to fight and ultimately defeat all the strongest villains.\n\nGoku even discovers how to get even greater strength out of this new form when he accesses Super Full Power Saiyan 4 energy. Omega Shenron proves to be a transformation that's superior to Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Vegeta as individuals, but Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta doesn't show any signs of struggling against the Shadow Dragon. and actively mocks the former threat.\n\nDragon Ball GT TV-PG ActionAdventure\n\nAfter Goku is made a kid again by the Black Star Dragon Balls, he goes on a journey to get back to his old self.\n\nRelease Date February 7, 1996 Main Genre Animation Seasons 1 Season Characters By Elise Baughman, Andrew Chandler, Masako Nozawa Creator Akira Toriyama Production Company Bird Studios, Toei Animation, Toei Company",

        "title": "Dragon Ball: Yamcha's Wolf Fang Fist, Explained",
        "body": "One of the original signature moves in the franchise, Yamcha's Wolf Fang Fist remains a powerful yet underrated move. Let's know everything about it.\n\nHighlights\n\nWolf Fang Fist is a unique and powerful signature move used by Yamcha, showcasing his martial prowess and agility. The technique allows Yamcha to seamlessly transition between offensive and defensive maneuvers, making it difficult for opponents to anticipate. Yamcha's journey from a fearsome desert bandit to a trusted ally is reflected in his use of the Wolf Fang Fist, solidifying it as an iconic technique.\n\nThe Dragon Ball franchise has had quite an evolutionary journey since the debut of the original Dragon Ball series in 1986. The franchise is known for its plot, superb fighting sequences which are mesmerizing for the viewers to watch. There are multiple factors that make the aforementioned fighting sequences so excellent. These include a set of unique characters, the intriguing plot of the series in the franchise and most importantly, numerous powerful, hard-hitting, and flamboyant moves used by various characters. One such move is Wolf Fang Fist, a powerful signature move which also happens to be one of the original signature moves in the franchise and is used by a deuteragonist called Yamcha.\n\nYamcha is one of the original characters in Dragon Ball. He was introduced in the initial chapters and episodes of the franchise as a desert bandit with commendable martial arts skills and tricks up his sleeve. He majorly used his signature move, Wolf Fang Fist, to defeat people that he came across to loot them afterward. Although Yamcha has used this move on several occasions and with different variations, it still remains to be underrated among the Dragon Ball franchise's fans and audience in general. Let's get to know everything that there is to know about the Wolf Fang Fist.\n\nRelated Dragon Ball: How Much Has Yamcha Changed Since the Emperor Pilaf Saga? Yamcha's role throughout Dragon Ball has varied since his introduction in the Emperor Pilaf Saga. How much has he changed since then?\n\nHow Does the Wolf Fang Fist Work?\n\nYamcha's Wolf Fang Fist is a signature technique in the Dragon Ball franchise, renowned for its ferocity and agility. Originating from his training under the desert bandit, Pu'ar's shapeshifting abilities allowed Yamcha to mimic the movements of a wolf, inspiring the creation of this powerful attack. When executing the Wolf Fang Fist, Yamcha adopts a crouched stance, poised to strike. With lightning-fast speed, he launches a barrage of punches and kicks, delivering them from various angles and directions.\n\nThe technique's fluidity allows Yamcha to seamlessly transition between offensive and defensive maneuvers, making it difficult for opponents to anticipate his next move. Visually, the Wolf Fang Fist is depicted with swift, blurred movements, emphasizing the sheer speed and precision of Yamcha's attacks. Each strike carries significant force, capable of inflicting damage upon impact. Despite its ferocity, the Wolf Fang Fist requires precise timing and control, showcasing Yamcha's martial prowess and mastery of the technique.\n\nThroughout the series, Yamcha employs the Wolf Fang Fist in numerous battles, showcasing its effectiveness as both an offensive and defensive maneuver. One notable instance occurs during his first encounter with Goku in the original Dragon Ball series. Facing off against the young Saiyan, Yamcha unleashes the Wolf Fang Fist, demonstrating its rapid strikes and unpredictable nature. This battle establishes the technique as a key component of the desert bandit Yamcha's combat repertoire. Another memorable usage of the Wolf Fang Fist is during Yamcha's participation in the World Martial Arts Tournament. In these tournaments, Yamcha often employs the technique against formidable opponents, highlighting its versatility in various combat scenarios. Whether facing off against fellow Z Fighters or challenging adversaries from across the Dragon Ball universe, Yamcha's Wolf Fang Fist remains a formidable asset in his arsenal.\n\nThe Strength of the Wolf Fang Fist\n\nInterestingly, Yamcha is not the only character to utilize the Wolf Fang Fist in the Dragon Ball series. During the early stages of Dragon Ball Z, Tien Shinhan, a fellow Z Fighter, demonstrates his own version of the technique known as the \"Wolf Fang Volleyball Fist.\" Inspired by Yamcha's technique, Tien incorporates his own modifications, showcasing the versatility of the original Wolf Fang Fist. Beyond its combat prowess, the Wolf Fang Fist reflects Yamcha's growth as a character throughout the Dragon Ball series. Initially introduced as a fearsome desert bandit, Yamcha undergoes significant development as he aligns himself with Goku and the Z Fighters.\n\nThe Wolf Fang Fist serves as a reminder of Yamcha's journey, from his days as a lone wolf to his role as a trusted ally in the fight against powerful adversaries. In battle, Yamcha frequently employs the Wolf Fang Fist to gain the upper hand against opponents, using its speed and agility to outmaneuver and outpace them. Whether facing off against fellow Z Fighters or challenging adversaries in tournaments, Yamcha relies on the Wolf Fang Fist as a reliable and formidable combat technique. The Wolf Fang Fist remains a testament to Yamcha's skill and determination as a warrior. Its versatility and adaptability make it a formidable asset in Yamcha's arsenal, solidifying its place as one of the iconic techniques in the Dragon Ball universe.\n\nMore Dragon Ball: Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon, Explained Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon is one of the most iconic techniques in Dragon Ball.

        "title": "Dragon Ball Z Art Unpacks the Origin of Future Trunks' Sword",
        "body": "A prolific Dragon Ball artist imagines just where Future Trunks got his legendary sword.\n\nThe origin of Future Trunks' sword in the Dragon Ball universe has always been up to debate. Arriving with the legendary weapon in tow when he first appeared in Dragon Ball Z, Vegeta's son used the sword to cut Frieza and half cement himself as one of the most popular members of the Z-Fighters. One prolific fan artist in Japan has offered their take on just where Trunks got the sword and who it was that gave the Z-Fighter the classic weapon.\n\nShonen fans know that there was a Dragon Ball Z project that tried to give an origin story to Trunks' sword. The thirteenth film of the franchise, Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of The Dragon, introduced a new hero and villain to the shonen series. Hirudegarn wasn't quite like any other Dragon Ball villain, appearing far more as a kaiju rather than an antagonist like Frieza or Cell. Linked to the behemoth was the hero Tapion, a legendary hero from an alien world who was the key to the kaiju arriving in the world. Since the movies are outside of continuity, this story wasn't the official method as to how Trunks would receive the sword, as the reason remains a mystery to this day.\n\nDid Gohan Give Trunks The Sword?\n\nIn the alternate future, Trunks was taught nearly everything he knew by Gohan, who was able to survive the assault on the Earth from Androids 17 and 18. Gohan's death helped light the spark that let the Future Trunks become a Super Saiyan for the first time. While it was never confirmed that Gohan gave Trunks his sword, it makes sense that Goku's son might have been responsible.\n\nThe last time we saw Future Trunks was in the Goku Black Arc of Dragon Ball Super, wherein he once again had his sword in tow to fight against the dark reflection of the main Z-Fighter. Following the tragic passing of creator Akira Toriyama, the future of the sequel series remains a mystery, so it's anyone's guess if we'll see this take on Trunks make a comeback. With Dragon Ball Daima hitting the small screen this fall, perhaps the original anime might have a surprise for fans with a Future Trunks appearance.\n\nWhat are your theories on where Future Trunks got his sword? Feel free to let us know in the comments or hit me up directly @EVComedy to talk all things comics, anime, and the world of the Z-Fighters.",

Dragon Ball Super Officially Makes Gohan's Beast Form His Own Power Original story created by Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou Close\n\nDragon Ball Super still hasn't revealed everything about Beast Mode, but it does explain what it is on a basic level. In chapter #103, after Gohan hit Goku so hard that he knocked him out of Ultra Instinct, Whis remarked that Gohan was using neither Super Saiyan nor a Divine technique, but \"a singular talent, all his own.\" That means that Gohan's Beast form is officially an extension of Gohan's personal talent as opposed to his Saiyan abilities, thus making it far more unique than it would have been if it was just another form of Super Saiyan.\n\nBeast Form's True Nature Completes Gohan's Arc In Dragon Ball Gohan's Beast Form gave him an identity all to himself, and a major leap in development\n\nGohan's Beast form being an extension of his personal talent is a great reveal, and that's especially because of how it ties into Gohan's character arc in Dragon Ball. A constant problem with Gohan over the years has been that he's always had people doing things to unlock his potential, only to quickly neglect his training and become too weak. Now, however, Gohan's current use of Beast Mode is noted by Goku to come from Gohan working to harness his potential, so it's clear that he's accepted that he needs to maintain his training to stay as strong as possible.\n\nThe confirmation of Beast Mode's true nature also plays into Gohan's character arc in the Dragon Ball Super manga. In the manga version of the Tournament of Power, Gohan told Kefla that he wanted to evolve as a human instead of a Saiyan, but that idea wasn't elaborated on in the years to follow. With Beast Mode explicitly not being a form of Super Saiyan, however, the most recent events of Dragon Ball Super finally complete Gohan's arc of evolving as a human instead of a Saiyan, and that's the best direction for his character to go right now.\n\nRelated 10 Best Dragon Ball Super Episodes Dragon Ball Super featured some incredible scenes of both comedy and action throughout its run. Here are 10 of the very best episodes in the series. Gohan's True Power Makes Frieza His Ultimate Foil His wholly unique powers make him remarkably similar to the famous foe\n\nOne of the most interesting things about the reveal of Beast Mode's true nature, however, is how it connects Gohan and Frieza. Both Gohan and Frieza were characters with a lot of raw power that they never put in the work to master, and similarly, both have had character arcs that have forced them to finally take their training seriously, resulting in the powerful forms of Beast Mode and Black Frieza. It's unknown when Dragon Ball Super will continue, but when it does, the story will hopefully further explore how much Beast Mode's true nature makes Gohan parallel Frieza.\n\nRead On Manga Plus\n\nDragon Ball Super Action Sci-FiAnimationFantasy\n\nDragon Ball Super is a sequel to the original Dragon Ball series as well as the fan-favorite Dragon Ball Z anime.

        "title": "These Two Characters Could Have Beat Cell Max if Gohan Beast Failed",
        "body": "Dragon Ball's Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta are extremely strong, but could they have taken out Red Ribbon's ultimate weapon, Cell Max?\n\nSummary\n\nDragon Ball Super: Super Hero's Cell Max is Red Ribbon's ultimate weapon and gets destroyed by Gohan Beast due to his various weaknesses, like an unstable disposition and lack of regeneration skills. Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta are as strong as Gods and have taken on many powerful threats, but these transformations require the right mindset and are hard to maintain. Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta could beat Cell Max, even if a perfected version of the villain gets activated.\n\nGoku and Vegeta have consistently played the roles of Dragon Ball's protagonists and there's rarely a villain beyond their abilities. With this in mind, Dragon Ball Super takes a curious pivot in its latest feature film, Super Hero, which has also been adapted into an expanded story arc in the series' ongoing manga. Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero boldly puts Goku and Vegeta on the backburner in favor of a story that instead celebrates Gohan and Piccolo, complete with long overdue new transformations for these neglected characters.\n\nGohan Beast and Orange Piccolo have their work cut out for them against Cell Max, especially since Dragon Ball's standard heroes are nowhere to be seen. Gohan Beast and Orange Piccolo emerge victorious against Cell Max, but the battle has left fans wondering if Goku and Vegeta would have experienced the same results. Gohan and Piccolo plant seeds of doubt over whether Cell Max is too strong for Goku and Vegeta, but a deeper breakdown of the characters' strengths and weaknesses may surprise audiences.\n\nRelated Dragon Ball Super: What Is Cell Max's Full Potential? Did the Super Hero Saga show Cell Max battling at his most powerful or did the Bio-Android have hidden abilities just waiting to be unlocked? Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nWho Is Cell Max & How Strong Is He?\n\nCell Max Is Red Ribbon's Ultimate Bio-Weapon & Tool Of Destruction\n\nClose 1:57 Related Is Ultra Ego Vegeta Stronger Than Son Gohan Beast? Gohan and Vegeta have both ascended to their most powerful forms yet in Dragon Ball Super. Which of the two is stronger?\n\nThe Red Ribbon Army is one of Dragon Ball's earliest enemies and they're responsible for the creation of evil Androids who have repeatedly threatened the planet. Red Ribbon makes a surprise return in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero and the film's climax unleashes their ultimate weapon, Cell Max. Dr. Hedo, the brilliant grandson of Dr. Gero, uses his grandfather's blueprints to engineer this state-of-the-art bio-weapon who greatly surpasses his predecessor. Cell Max is a lumbering, rampaging giant who manages to overpower the combined efforts of Gamma 1 and 2, Goten, Trunks, Android 18, Krillin, Ultimate Gohan, and Power Awakening Piccolo.\n\nThis is no small feat, especially when the heroes attack in tandem and coordinate an impressive strategy. There are occasionally moments where it appears that the Gamma Androids hold the advantage, but this is more of a reflection of Cell Max's confusion and early activation, rather than a lack of strength. He's still able to survive Gamma 2's self-destruct maneuver, Core Breaker, while he accrues minimal damage from the gambit. Gohan's Beast transformation comfortably gives the Saiyan the advantage over Cell Max. However, this largely translates to Cell Max's physical strength.\n\nGohan Beast completely trumps Cell Max when it comes to punches, kicks, and other physical blows. Cell Max still manages to hold his own when it comes to his impressive arsenal of energy attacks. Cell Max is equipped with many dangerous ki projectiles, such as his Mouth Energy Wave, Eye Laser, and Disaster Ray. Cell Max's Explosive Scream is easily his strongest attack and a technique that would likely still cause concern for Goku and Vegeta.\n\nCell Max's Explosive Scream is a cataclysmic ability that conjures a moon-sized energy ball that's akin to Frieza's Supernova. Additionally, the Explosive Scream has the gravitational pull of a black hole and grows increasingly powerful as it absorbs energy from its surroundings. Under the right circumstances, Cell Max's Explosive Scream could absorb Goku's Spirit Bomb or cause Vegeta's Forced Spirit Fission to malfunction.\n\nHow Strong Are Ultra Instinct Goku & Ultra Ego Vegeta?\n\nThe Saiyans' New Transformations Elevate Them To Godly Power Levels\n\nClose Related Is Ultra Ego Vegeta Stronger Than Ultra Instinct Goku? Ultra Ego Vegeta is the Vegeta's latest form to appear in Dragon Ball. But can Vegeta finally overpower Goku?\n\nOne of Dragon Ball's most satisfying developments is how Goku and Vegeta perpetually match each other's Super Saiyan milestones. These two characters are usually the first ones to tap into new Super Saiyan tiers of strength, but Dragon Ball Super pushes them both down separate - yet equal - paths. Goku first experiences Ultra Instinct powers during his clash against Jiren in the Tournament of Power. This zen-like state is the standard for the galaxy's Angels and pushes the user's body to act almost independently of their thoughts.\n\nGoku's journey to Ultra Instinct supremacy hasn't been easy and he's had to conquer several steps before he reaches the seemingly final stage, True Ultra Instinct. True Ultra Instinct showcases phenomenal speed and strength, but it also includes intimidating techniques like the Supreme Kamehameha and a massive energy avatar that fights for Goku. Goku has used Ultra Instinct to take down powerful threats such as Universe 11's Jiren and Planet-Eater Moro, while also putting up a worthy challenge against Granolah and Gas, all of whom are likely comparable to Cell Max's strength.\n\nVegeta undergoes a revelatory breakthrough when he stops trying to force an Ultra Instinct transformation on himself and he instead pioneers his own top tier transformation, Ultra Ego. Ultra Ego Vegeta is a worthy counterpoint to Ultra Instinct Goku who provides essential assistance against Granolah and Gas. Ultra Ego Vegeta rewards the Saiyan with the power of a Destroyer, which essentially puts him on par with a God of Destruction, even if he hasn't officially risen to this prestigious rank.\n\nRather than operating on instinct and serenity, Ultra Ego is driven by rage and aggression. Vegeta actively grows stronger based upon the damage that he takes on, which is ideal for the Saiyan's stubborn disposition. Ultra Ego Vegeta can accomplish incredible things, especially if he's prepared to be a glutton for punishment. It's not hard to imagine him exacerbating Cell Max's rage for the purpose of taking on greater damage so that he's able to surpass the bio-weapon if he finds himself falling short in strength.\n\nWhat Are Cell Max's Weaknesses?\n\nThe Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Villain Has His Share Of Shortcomings\n\nClose Related 8 Things You Didn't Know About Dragon Ball Super's Ultimate Villain, Cell Max Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero finally brings back a long-anticipated villain to the series in the form of Cell Max -- but he's not the Cell fans know.\n\nCell Max is Red Ribbon's strongest creation, but it's important to recognize that this bio-weapon is prematurely activated before he's reached complete perfection. Cell Max's early awakening might have been the key to Gohan Beast and Orange Piccolo's success against the tyrant. Cell Max is unstable and lacks refined intelligence, which essentially reduces him to a blunt weapon. The original Cell is as brilliant as he is powerful and his intelligence becomes a major factor in why he's so successful against Earth's greatest heroes.\n\nCell Max's rudimentary intellect is definitely a disadvantage that gives Goku and Vegeta an edge. However, Cell Max also has several other setbacks that in some ways make him even less impressive than his predecessor. For one, Cell Max has a self-destruct sequence that covers a much smaller radius than that of the original Cell, which had the potential to destroy the planet. In this case, it wouldn't be a challenge for Goku and Vegeta to trigger this mechanism and then use Instant Transmission to vacate to a safer destination.\n\nDr. Hedo also installs a weak spot on Cell Max's head that's designed to function as a failsafe measure, just in case the monster does go rogue. This weakness is telegraphed to the heroes, who would definitely share this information with Goku and Vegeta so that their ability to defeat Cell Max is further streamlined. One of the original Cell's greatest assets is that he possessed a regeneration factor that could restore him from a single cell, which means that self-destruction wasn't even fatal for him.\n\nCell Max doesn't possess this ability and he even loses one of his arms during his big fight in Super Hero. This is a major weakness and Goku & Vegeta could easily fire some of their strongest energy attacks at Cell Max's arms so that he's less capable of retaliation. Cell Max's flight is also linked to the wings on his back, rather than it being ki-based flight. Goku and Vegeta could permanently ground Cell Max by applying the same treatment to his wings. They could then continue their assault from the skies, where they'd be unreachable to Cell Max.\n\nWhat Are Ultra Instinct Goku & Ultra Ego Vegeta's Weaknesses?\n\nThe Saiyans' Strongest Transformations Are Far From Perfect\n\nClose Related Dragon Ball: Why Caulifla and Kale Should Unlock Ultra Ego and Ultra Instinct Caulifla and Kale were fan-favorites in the Tournament of Power, and bringing them back with Ultra Ego and Ultra Instinct would be perfect.\n\nGoku and Vegeta have never been stronger since they've ascended to Ultra Instinct and Ultra Ego status, but this doesn't mean that these new transformations don't come with their own unique liabilities. Ultra Instinct and Ultra Ego aren't as easy to trigger and maintain as their previous Super Saiyan forms. Both of these transformations require the right mindset in order to be activated and sustained. Goku's become increasingly comfortable with Ultra Instinct and he makes the transformation look easy, but he still can't do if his mind is overly distracted, or he finds rogue emotions like fear and anger clouding his thoughts.\n\nIt's entirely possible that Goku would be unable to transform into his Ultra Instinct state if Cell Max has just caused mass casualties or threatened someone who he cares about. Curiously, it's this exact spectacle that triggers Gohan's Beast transformation, but the same sight would likely cause an adverse reaction in Goku. Vegeta's valuable Ultra Ego transformation is plagued by similar setbacks.\n\nVegeta doesn't need a clear mind in order to activate this transformation, but he does need to be in the proper mindset of a Destroyer. Vegeta is forced to fight in his Super Saiyan Blue state if he's unable to ignite his fighting spirit and aggression. These are very specific conditions that Goku and Vegeta know how to account for, but they're still substantial weaknesses that could become the deciding factor in a clash against Cell Max, who is always at peak power.\n\nIs A Saiyan Showdown Against Cell Max Still Possible?\n\nRed Ribbon Could Still Make A Comeback\n\nClose Related Dragon Ball Super Chapter 103 Recap & Spoilers: A Legacy Toward The Future Dragon Ball Super, Chapter 103, brings the manga's Super Hero Saga to its climactic conclusion and delivers far more than a Gohan and Goku brawl.\n\nCell Max's destruction and Goku & Vegeta's inability to face this colossal threat is what triggered this hypothetical discussion in the first place. That being said, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero concludes with some Red Ribbon cohorts still lurking in the shadows and determined to get revenge. Carmine and Soldier #15 have returned in Dragon Ball Super's manga and clearly have plans for a comeback, even if they're not sure what that will be. Many fans have focused on Carmine and Soldier #15's decision to film the heroes' superpowered sparring sessions, which in turn could be used to program and inform a stronger version of Cell Max. Dragon Ball Super also has a dangling plotline when it comes to the surviving members of the Heeter Force.\n\nOil and Macki have Seven-Three in their possession, who has also acquired tremendous intel on the heroes. Red Ribbon and the Heeter Force could pool their resources together and reactivate Cell Max to make sure that he's not prematurely awakened. Akira Toriyama has also stated that if Cell Max was able to reach completion rather than being activated early, then not even Broly would be able to defeat him. This is a testament to Cell Max's potential, but Goku and Vegeta have since grown much stronger in the interim and Broly has yet to face their strongest transformations. A fully completed Cell Max, with additional intel, would definitely be a serious threat to Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta, but the two Saiyans would still be able to overcome their perfect foe.\n\nDragon Ball Super TV-PG AnimeActionAdventure\n\nWith Majin Buu defeated half-a-year prior, peace returns to Earth, where Son Goku (now a radish farmer) and his friends now live peaceful lives.\n\nRelease Date January 7, 2017 Cast Masako Nozawa , Takeshi Kusao , Ry\u00f4 Horikawa , Hiromi Tsuru Main Genre Anime Seasons 5",

        "title": "'That was an act': Sam Bankman-Fried's fate is sealed by his own words",
        "body": "By the age of 30, Sam Bankman-Fried had convinced a million people that he was a safe custodian of their hard-earned cash.\n\nBut stood in a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday, head of curly hair bowed, the one-time master of persuasion failed to win over the person who, in that moment, mattered most: a federal judge who would soon consign him to a quarter-century behind bars.\n\nOnce embraced by figures such as former US president Bill Clinton and New York mayor Eric Adams, the FTX founder had \"presented himself as the good guy, all in favour of appropriate regulation of the crypto industry\", Judge Lewis Kaplan said. \"In my view that was an act.\"\n\nIndeed, the Sam Bankman-Fried show played no small part in sealing his fate.\n\nIn a two-hour hearing, Bankman-Fried's words came back to haunt him time and again. Kaplan turned the air blue as he reminded the court of Bankman-Fried's own assessment of his motives in comments to a reporter soon after FTX's implosion. His public advocacy for tougher crypto rules, Bankman-Fried had confessed, was \"just PR\", adding: \"fuck regulators\".\n\nBankman-Fried \"made so many public statements before [the trial] that the court believed demonstrated a total lack of the understanding of the seriousness of his crime\", said Rachel Maimin, a former federal prosecutor in the office that charged the FTX founder, now at Lowenstein Sandler.\n\nThe comments, she added, suggested \"he didn't seem to grasp the seriousness of his offence\".\n\nAs shown through evidence at trial, Bankman-Fried's rehabilitation campaign was already in full swing in the hours before his cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapsed with an $8bn hole in its balance sheet in November 2022, and continued for months after.\n\nWhen FTX customers demanded to know the fate of their deposits, he sent dozens of tweets assuring them everything would be OK, and directed others at the exchange to do the same. After he was charged, Bankman-Fried spoke with numerous reporters in an effort to convey his side of the story, and told his version of events to the bestselling author Michael Lewis.\n\nBankman-Fried's decision to testify in his own defence at trial -- a move most white-collar lawyers do not recommend -- also backfired spectacularly.\n\nNot only did he fail to win over the jurors with his account of FTX's collapse -- he was convicted after just a few hours of deliberation on seven counts of fraud and money laundering -- but Kaplan concluded on Thursday that Bankman-Fried had lied in testimony about when he knew about the $8bn hole, and the illicit use of customer funds, among other things.\n\nKaplan also leaned heavily on comments made by Bankman-Fried to his former colleague and erstwhile girlfriend Caroline Ellison, who gave evidence at trial.\n\nShe recalled Bankman-Fried had described himself as \"risk neutral\", the judge reminded the court, and recollected conversations about \"being willing to take large coin flips\" as long as there was some potential upside, even \"if it came up tails and the world was destroyed\".\n\nEllison's memory of Bankman-Fried telling her there was a \"5 per cent chance\" he could become US president also came up. It was proof, Kaplan said, of Bankman-Fried's ambition to become a \"hugely politically influential [person] in this country\".\n\nEven Bankman-Fried's private musings were quoted back to him, to disastrous effect. Prosecutor Nick Roos referred to contemporaneous notes made by Bankman-Fried after the FTX bankruptcy, which were filed to the court in advance of sentencing.\n\n\"His own writings reveal a plan to relaunch FTX or something similar,\" Roos told the court at Thursday's hearing. \"If Mr Bankman-Fried thought the mathematics were justified, he would do it again.\"\n\nWidge Devaney, a former federal prosecutor who has appeared in front of Kaplan, said the judge's comments suggested he viewed Bankman-Fried as somebody with a cynical \"Ayn Rand view of the world\" who \"needs to be kept apart from society for a period of time\".\n\nNot that society appeared to be listening. During his short but spectacular career, Bankman-Fried was the ultimate crypto evangelist, and FTX was meant to make the technology accessible to the masses. His indictment and the company's swift collapse -- deemed by many at the time as a fatal blow to the sector -- has been anything but, with global crypto markets booming once again.\n\nEven as Roos decried the \"extreme emotional and personal damage\" done by Bankman-Fried in court on Thursday, crypto's animal spirits remained uncowed. Bitcoin was once again trading at near all-time highs. Millions of dollars were being pumped into \"meme\" tokens such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Pepe, and the amount invested in recently launched crypto ETFs topped $70bn worldwide.\n\nSunil Kavuri, a former FTX customer who had flown in from London to underline the impact the exchange's collapse had on him and others, seemed more exercised by the fact that he could no longer access his crypto assets than regretful that he invested in the sector to begin with. \"It's our property, we are not unsecured creditors,\" he told Kaplan at Thursday's hearing.\n\nTo the crypto faithful watching proceedings, Bankman-Fried was just a rotten apple in an otherwise thriving industry.\n\n\"This trial is the conclusion of a sorry episode that the market has moved on from. Enron was not a demonstration that all energy markets were fraudulent, nor was [Bernie] Madoff an indicator of all hedge funds\" said Michael Silberberg, of crypto hedge fund Alt Tab Capital, after the sentencing. \"We believe in the crypto market's robustness and support the prosecution of bad actors.\"\n\nFor SBF, as he was widely known, even that assessment was unwarranted. The 32-year-old, who has been helping teach prisoners seeking to get their high school diplomas while awaiting his sentence, showed a hint of emotion when he told the court during a long speech: \"I know how people see me\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and I understand why.\"\n\nIn the end, none of it was enough. \"In the head of this mathematical wizard\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he was viewing the cost of getting caught, discounted by the probability or improbability\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009of getting away without getting caught,\" Kaplan, who has been on the Manhattan federal bench for 30 years, summarised. \"That was the game.\"",

Solar Industries, a midcap, has come a long way. The stock which split into a 1:5 ratio in mid-2016 has journeyed from nearly Rs 650 to a whopping near Rs 8,800 levels by end of FY24. The stock has skyrocketed by over 1,250% in this period. And the stock is set to explode further.\n\nSolar Industries Share Price:\n\nOn March 28, 2024, Solar Industries' share price ended at Rs 8,786.05 apiece, with a market cap of Rs 79,505.01 crore on BSE. The stock's 52-week high and low is at Rs 9,429.10 and Rs 3,456.95 apiece currently.\n\nSo far in 2024, the stock zoomed nearly 30%. While in a year, the stock gained by 133%. In a span of 5 years, the stock has advanced by nearly 718% on BSE.\n\nThe stock price has been adjusted after the stock split in July 2016, and yet Solar Industries has made impressive gains.\n\nSolar Industries Stock Split Charm:\n\nSolar Industries has turned ex-split only once. Its share price was split by a 1:5 ratio with effect from July 13, 2016. The face value of the stock was trimmed from Rs 10 each to Rs 2 each.\n\nAfter adjusting to stock splits, on July 13, 2016, Solar Industries share price was at Rs 649.40 apiece. And since then, it has climbed by a breathtaking 1252.95% to date.\n\nApart from this, Solar has also delivered 27 dividends since September 2006.\n\n1:2 Split, 70% Dividend YTD: ICICI Direct Gives Buy On Cochin Shipyard; Miniratna Stock Up 280% In 1 Year\n\nSolar Industries New Target Price:\n\nICICI Securities believes that the defence segment is going to be a key driver for Solar Industries.\n\nIn its latest research note, ICICI Securities said, \"In Q4FY24, SOIL has received cumulative export orders worth INR 14.3bn of short duration (2-3 years). As a result, we expect defence revenue at INR 17.8bn and INR 23.5bn in FY25E and FY26E, respectively.\"\n\nKey points highlighted by the brokerage are --- 1) Media reports suggest SOIL is developing bombs for Su-30MKI; 2) our channel checks suggest Pinaka order is likely to be awarded soon; 3) global shortage of ammunition provides an opportunity; and 4) SOIL is well equipped to develop loitering munitions, counter drones and long-range rockets.\n\nAlso, the brokerage believes SOIL would be able to register volume growth of 15% p.a. over the next couple of years. Besides, efforts are afoot to expand capacity in Nagpur, Rajasthan Explosives & Chemicals and come up with greenfield plants in Western and Southern India.\n\n\"Combined with traction in overseas markets, as the company is venturing in new markets such as Kazakhstan (mining) and Saudi Arabia (Construction), we believe volume growth is likely to sustain in near to medium term,\" the brokerage's note said.\n\nFinally, the brokerage added, \"Considering the aforesaid, we raise our FY25/26E EPS by 4%/16%; however, we maintain multiple as 55x as we still see significant prospects in defence space, which have not yet been captured in our estimates. Our revised TP works out to INR 10,950 (earlier INR 9,050). Maintain BUY.\"\n\nTaking into consideration the target price and latest price level, there is a potential of 24.6% in Solar Industries.\n\nSolar Industries has extensive experience, expertise and potential founded on its years of experience in the Industrial Explosives segment. Also, the company has entered into Defence and set up one of the world's most integrated facilities for Ammunition.\n\nDisclaimer: The recommendations made above are by market analysts and are not advised by either the author nor Greynium Information Technologies.

        "title": "Meta's XR Dominance Wanes as Market Declines: 2023 Shipment Analysis - Gizmochina",
        "body": "Extended reality technology is gaining popularity day by day, or so we thought. After Apple introduced the Vision Pro, this technology, which we hear about almost every day, is one of the most popular topics of tech word along with artificial intelligence. However, it seems that this popularity has not been reflected in sales. Because the global XR headset market saw a substantial drop in 2023. Here are the details...\n\nXR Headset Market Sees First Significant Decline After Years of Growth\n\nAccording to Counterpoint, shipments of Global Extended Reality (XR) headsets experienced a 19% decrease compared to the previous year. This is a notable shift for a market that has steadily grown in recent years. New product releases played a mitigating role - Sony's PlayStation VR2 and Meta Quest 3 helped lessen the severity of the decline. Still, even these products couldn't fully reverse the downward trend.\n\nWhile Counterpoint's research doesn't specify the decline's root cause, there are two plausible explanations. First, the announcement of Apple's Vision Pro headset, though released in February, may have dampened demand in 2023. Leaks about the product circulated long before its announcement, potentially leading those considering an XR investment to hold out for what they might deem a superior option.\n\nAnother, perhaps more likely, reason lies in the state of the technology itself. VR and AR have undoubtedly advanced, but they remain niche and expensive for widespread, everyday use beyond a few standout games and applications. Many headset owners may find their devices collecting dust shortly after the initial novelty wears off. Potential buyers might then hesitate at the prospect of these sizable price tags.\n\nOf course, we'll need to wait for 2024's results to draw definitive conclusions, and considering the first quarter is nearly over, this insight may arrive sooner than later. Counterpoint's report also illustrates a challenge for Meta, the current industry leader. In 2023, the company captured 59% of total global XR headset shipments, a decrease from the 77% share in 2022. While PS VR2 certainly contributes to this, such a significant drop could hint at potential struggles for the company. With new entrants emerging, the social media giant may face even tougher competition in the years ahead.\n\nRELATED:",

        "body": "If you've been eagerly awaiting more Apple Immersive Video content to watch on the Apple Vision Pro, it's your lucky day. Apple (AAPL) announced a film showcasing the best of the 2023 MLS Cup Playoffs right before the start of the 2024 MLS Season in February 2024. Now, Apple is sharing more details on the film and an exact release time.\n\nThe film -- \"2023 MLS Cup Highlights\" -- runs five minutes long and drops March 28, at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. It will be accessible via the Apple TV app on Vision Pro and is free for folks who own the spatial computer.\n\nRelated: Disney+ just marked a major milestone with a ton of new content\n\nLike the other Apple Immersive Video that takes you up close on a safari or a tightrope suspended high above a canyon, this film will put you in the middle of the action. Specifically, the matches are between the Columbus Crew and LAFC with voiceovers from Taylor Twellman and Jake Zivin. Loyal MLS Season Pass watches will recognize those two names as broadcasters.\n\nUsing proprietary special cameras that record in 8K 3D for a 180-degree field of view, Apple can bring a viewer close to the action, as in filming right about the goal at a pivotal moment, along the sides of the pitch to see the footwork to the locker room as the Columbus Crew celebrates the championship.\n\nAlongside the likely stunning visuals, Apple has matching Spatial Audio to up the immersion, and this will be the first taste of immersive content in the sports world. At the same time, hopefully, Apple is filming more of the 2024 MLS Season and other sports with the same Immersive Video format.\n\nWith MLS Season Pass, you can also watch any game streamed on upwards of a 100-inch screen either overlaid to your real environment or immersed into an environment on the Apple Vision Pro. You can read more about the entertainment experience in our review and hands-on with watching \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" on Disney+ here.\n\nAlongside the launch of the \"2023 MLS Cup Highlights\" this evening, there are many new applications, games to watch, and even new games on the Vision Pro. Via Apple Arcade, you can now play \"Alto's Odyssey: The Lost City,\"\"Gibbon: Beyond the Trees,\" and \"Spire Blast.\" All upping the immersion of a normal game experience and letting you control it with your hands.\n\nAdditionally, Apple TV+ subscribers can catch the first game of Friday Night Baseball for the 2024 MLB season streaming at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on March 29.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n\nThe Arena Media Brands, LLC THESTREET is a registered trademark of TheStreet, Inc.",

        "title": "Do you need a VPN at home? Potential benefits explained | Digital Trends",
        "body": "Using a VPN when you're out and about makes a lot of sense. You want to protect your user data and important info when using public Wi-Fi to surf the web, and not many free-to-join networks provide the end-to-end encryption a VPN delivers. But in the safety and privacy of one's own home, should you still be using a VPN? Our recommendation is a strong \"yes,\" and for more than one reason, too.\n\nContents Using a VPN at home keeps you more privateYour work is more privateUsing a VPN gives you more streaming options at homeA VPN at home can save you moneyGamers get a better serviceDownloads just got easierWhat are the best VPNs to use at home? How much does a VPN cost?Will a VPN work on all my devices?Just how vital is a VPN at home?Show 5 more items\n\nUsing a VPN at home keeps you more private\n\nMany VPNs are designed to stop nefarious users from hacking into your network. That's something that mostly affects public connections and is unlikely to happen from home.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nHowever, while using your own private network means you can restrict who has access to your Wi-Fi connection, it's not 100% private. That's because you're still connecting directly to your ISP. By doing so, your ISP is able to see what sites you're browsing.\n\nRelated The 6 best laptops for streaming on Twitch, YouTube, and more How much RAM do you need for a laptop, gaming PC, or tablet? Is there an ExpressVPN free trial in 2024? It's complicated\n\nThis isn't necessarily an issue to everyone but to some users, you may want to keep more secure and more private. Not everyone wants a company to know exactly what they're doing and that's perfectly reasonable. It's not like you'd go into the street and shout your business, right? Nor do you want your browsing history to be able to do this for your ISP.\n\nBy using a VPN, your data is encrypted so your ISP never knows where you're browsing or what you're doing online. A good quality VPN doesn't keep logs so there's no way to trace what you've been doing or when.\n\nIf you want to keep as anonymous as possible online, you need to use a VPN to achieve this.\n\nYour work is more private\n\nWith many of us working from home nowadays, it's important to keep your work private. While having your home network hacked is fairly unlikely, if you have an important job, it's certainly possible. By connecting to your work's network via a VPN, you can keep things more secure. That means you can work just as securely from home as you would if you were at the office. Your employer will be grateful but you also won't have to worry about being responsible for any security breaches.\n\nUsing a VPN gives you more streaming options at home\n\nIf you use a VPN, you can watch streaming content that's based elsewhere. Located in the U.S. and want to watch the content that British Netflix offers? Switch your VPN location to somewhere in the U.K. and you can do exactly that.\n\nIt's a great way of expanding your options when it comes to streaming content. It also works for sporting events and even streaming services that are not ordinarily available in your country. It can be a breach of the contract you've agreed to with a streaming service though so check the legalities before doing so.\n\nA VPN at home can save you money\n\nA VPN can actually save you money in the long term. How? Some retailers like hotels or flight companies track your data and cookies, before charging you extra for their services. For instance, if you use many luxury retailers, a flight company might detect this and charge you extra because hey, you can afford it, right?\n\nIt's a very dubious practice but it happens. Even on a simpler level, if you regularly check flight prices, it can affect how much a ticket will cost you. Using a VPN means that your information is hidden so no data is provided to the company and you're given the lowest price possible.\n\nVPNs don't cost much so just one flight could work out saving you more than the cost of the VPN.\n\nGamers get a better service\n\nIf your ISP loves to throttle your connection when you're gaming, you need a VPN. By using a VPN, you can disguise your activity so your ISP doesn't know you're playing online games all day long or downloading the latest patches. ISPs typically don't throttle browsing activities but they will limit gaming after a time.\n\nBy using a VPN, they won't know what you're doing, meaning you can enjoy a better quality of service at all times. In some cases, it even gives you access to other regional servers so you can team up with your international buddies easily.\n\nDownloads just got easier\n\nIf you regularly download large files, your ISP probably isn't a big fan. Many ISPs limit how much you can download in a day, usually by restricting your download speeds.\n\nIf you use a VPN, the ISP can't detect how much you're downloading in a day as your usage is coming from a different source.\n\nThis is particularly useful if you use a torrent client to download files as some ISPs are not fans of peer-to-peer sharing even though it can be used for legal files as well as more dubious content. Using a VPN means you won't be restricted in any way here.\n\nWhat are the best VPNs to use at home?\n\nThe good thing about using a VPN for your home network is there are no shortage of options to choose from. We have several articles that go over the best VPNs to use, and others that focus on specific hardware you can add your VPN service to (like the Apple TV 4K). We do have our short list of tried and true MVPs though.\n\nSome of our favorite VPN platforms include NordVPN, ExpressVPN, SurfShark, and IPVanish.\n\nHow much does a VPN cost?\n\nThat all depends on what VPN service you're using. There are several brands that offer free VPN services. These options are good if you're short on cash and want some kind of web protection, even just temporarily. Once your fortunes turn though, we'd recommend upgrading to a paid VPN.\n\nWhy, you may be asking? Generally speaking, subscription-based VPN platforms tend to be better in just about every way. Advanced encryption tools, password managers, cloud storage, and the ability to use your VPN on unlimited devices may be paywalled features, but these enhanced safeguards could be worth their weight in gold.\n\nWill a VPN work on all my devices?\n\nAgain, that depends on the product. For example, platforms like NordVPN will allow you to operate a VPN on up to 10 devices. Some other platforms may cap you at five devices, while others may offer unlimited device support.\n\nJust how vital is a VPN at home?\n\nOkay, so having a VPN at home isn't as vital as if you regularly travel and browse the internet on your laptop or phone, but it is important.\n\nWhile accessing a public Wi-Fi network is where the biggest dangers are, threats are still viable everywhere. By using a VPN at home, you're much safer than before and you know you've covered all the bases.\n\nCrucially, no one wants their ISP to be selling their data, and using a VPN stops that. Most VPNs are available for a very low price too, meaning there's hardly anything to lose in using one.\n\nMost people wouldn't rely on one simple lock on their front door or prized possessions, and that should be the same for your internet connection. It simply makes sense to give yourself an extra layer of security, especially if you regularly browse the internet and use it for work and banking needs.\n\nThrow in the extra benefits like avoiding bandwidth throttling and being able to circumvent geo-restrictions as and when needed, and a VPN is an essential tool. It could even save you money if you regularly buy flights or hotel rooms.\n\nEditors' Recommendations What is VSync, and why do you need it? Is there a Surfshark free trial?

        "title": "New iPads Are Coming  --  But Not Until May",
        "body": "In something of a \"good news/bad news\" report, Bloombeg's Mark Gurman has confirmed that Apple's new iPad Air and iPad Pro lineup has officially entered production. The bad news? It looks like they aren't coming until May.\n\nIn a new report today, Gurman shares additional details on Apple's exciting early 2024 iPad models. While there aren't any surprises here after all the rumors we've heard over the past several weeks, things appear to be locked down now that the iPads are on the assembly line.\n\nThe new iPad Pro models are codenamed J717, J718, J720, and J721, presumably accounting for the Wi-FI and Wi-Fi + Cellular versions in the two different sizes. They'll pack in Apple's M3 chip and get \"crisper new OLED displays.\" They'll also be designed to work with \"redesigned versions of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil,\" although it's still unclear exactly what those design changes will be.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPad Air will get a big brother in the form of a 12.9-inch screen size, bringing the larger form factor to a broader audience that might not otherwise want to splurge on the pricey iPad Pro. Gurman doesn't offer any specifics on what chip will power these new iPad Air models, but since the current 2022 version uses an M1, it would be logical to assume these will get the M2 to keep them a notch being the premium iPad Pro.\n\nThere aren't many other upgrades expected in the new iPad Air, although persistent rumors have suggested that Apple plans to move the camera from the short edge to the long edge, making it more usable in landscape orientation. A sizeable number of iPad users have been clamoring for this for years, but even though this change came to the standard 10th-generation iPad in 2022, the M2 iPad Pro models released around the same time left the camera in the same position as before.\n\nHowever, that may not have merely been intransigence on Apple's part. In the iPad Pro and iPad Air, a magnetic charging dock for the Apple Pencil occupies the space where the front camera would need to go, and it's probably telling that although Apple introduced a new USB-C pencil last fall that magnetically attaches to the 10th-gen iPad, there's no charging support.\n\nThis could be why Apple is preparing to introduce a new Apple Pencil, which could be redesigned to solve the magnetic charging problem by docking elsewhere on the new models. There's been some speculation about other new features Apple could bring to its third-generation stylus, but those rumors have been making the rounds for years, yet we've heard nothing concrete about the Apple Pencil that's coming other than that it will be \"a redesigned version.\"\n\nDitto for the Magic Keyboard, which isn't likely to be more than a form-factor change to accommodate the new iPad Pro models, which are expected to be substantially thinner thanks to the new OLED screen technology.\n\nAs for the delay, Gurman maintains that Apple wanted to have the new iPads out by the end of March, but between \"finishing software for the devices\" and dealing with some \"complex new manufacturing techniques\" for the screens, the timeline has slipped back from late March to mid-April, and now into May.\n\nWe've already been through what Gurman calls \"a drought\" in the iPad product lineup. 2023 was the first year in the 13-year history of Apple's tablet that not a single new model was shown, and by the time May rolls around, it will have been 554 days, or over 18 months, since a new iPad model was introduced.\n\n[The information provided in this article has NOT been confirmed by Apple and may be speculation. Provided details may not be factual. Take all rumors, tech or otherwise, with a grain of salt.]",

        "body": "Apple's latest iOS 17 updates are packed with new and useful features. However, if you're among the many iPhone users struggling with battery life throughout the day, some of these additions might be the culprits.\n\nLock Screen widgets and keyboard vibrations, also known as haptic feedback, could be consuming more of your battery than you realize. If so, here's how to manage these features.\n\niPhone Lock Screen widgets were first introduced in iOS 16 and further refined in iOS 17. They're super helpful as they make important information more accessible with a glance without needing to unlock your iPhone.\n\nThere are several types of Lock Screen widgets that offer built-in functionality, such as Clock, Weather, and Calendar, plus plenty of third-party widgets that can be found in health and finance apps.\n\nHowever, when a widget is on your Lock Screen, its corresponding app needs to run in the background. If your Lock Screen is loaded with widgets and your battery is constantly on E, some of those widgets might be to blame. Here's how to add and remove Lock Screen widgets:\n\niPhone keyboard vibration was added in iOS 17. If you've made it this far without your keyboard vibrating, you can probably live without it now. Even Apple warns that \"keyboard haptics might affect the battery life of your iPhone.\" Here's how to turn keyboard vibration on or off:\n\nWhile Lock Screen widgets can be extremely useful and keyboard haptics are novel and fun, there's a cost. If preserving your iPhone's daily battery life is important, you probably want to remove Lock Screen Widgets and reduce haptics wherever possible.",

        "body": "SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A Southern California man convicted of killing his mother as a teenager was captured in Mexico a week after he walked away from a halfway house, violating the conditions of his probation, authorities said.\n\nIke Nicholas Souzer, 20, was arrested Wednesday in the coastal city of Rosarito by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Mexican officials, the Orange County District Attorney's Office said. He was returned to California.\n\nDuring the weeklong manhunt, the district attorney's office described Souzer as dangerous and violent.\n\nSouzer had already served his sentence for stabbing his mother to death in 2017, when he was 13. He was subsequently convicted on a vandalism charge and served a short sentence, then released from custody March 20, prosecutors said.\n\nThe judge in that case also sentenced Souzer to two years of probation.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In 2022, he was let out of jail and moved to a halfway house in Santa Ana where he removed his electronic monitor and left. He was later captured by police.\n\nOrange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said Souzer deserved harsher sentences and blamed judges who have handled his cases.\n\n\"My prosecutors have spent years and years trying to do everything they can to keep this violent criminal behind bars, and at every turn, the very judges who are elected to protect public safety have done little to do so and instead have given him break after break after break,\" Spitzer said in a statement.\n\nSouzer was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the death of his mother. His defense attorney argued that the killing was in self-defense and said the teen had experienced years of abuse, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nSouzer has also been charged with three attacks on correctional officers, possessing a shank in jail, and most recently, drawing graffiti on a freeway underpass, prosecutors said.\n\nHe also escaped a juvenile detention facility in 2019.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "body": "Jaroslaw Jarz\u0105bkowski, better known by his Counter-Strike name pashaBiceps, has wowed the internet after sharing clips and pictures of himself cycling a pedal boat across the open Baltic Sea to watch the very first CS2 Copenhagen Major. Jaroslaw had cycled over a thousand kilometers last year to the Paris Major from Poland and is attempting a similar challenge this year.\n\nHe has been frequently updating his socials with news about his journey from his country to Denmark and had arrived in the seaside city of Rostock, Germany, after starting off last weekend on March 23. Instead of taking the ferry over the Baltic Sea to cross into Denmark, pashaBiceps used a cycle-pedal boat or water bike called Pola One for most of the way (approximately 10 hours). He shared a short clip of himself titled \"Pirate of the Baltic Sea\" on X.\n\nPolish Counter-Strike legend pashaBiceps is cycling about 1000 KM to see the 2024 PGL Major Copenhagen\n\nJaroslaw is a proper icon in the Counter-Strike community, famous for being part of the legendary Polish group Golden Five. Widely celebrated as one of the most successful esports professionals, he officially retired as a player in 2019 and signed on with Team Liquid as a content creator before leaving in 2022.\n\nSince then, pasaBicepts has been participating in MMA fights. Based out of Warsaw, Poland, he competes in the men's middleweight bouts in the Eastern European region. However, his love for gaming is not over, as is evident from the way he cycled to France last year for the Major and is still attempting to reach Copenhagen.\n\nWhile cycling for 1000km is impressive in itself, the fact that the 35-year-old attempted to cross the open Baltic Sea using a cycle boat has naturally attracted a lot of attention on social media. In fact, before embarking on the overseas journey, he had described taking the ferry as cheating.\n\nBut readers should note that after reaching the shores of Denmark, pashaBiceps came clean, stating that he did resort to using another boat due to weather conditions, jokingly calling himself a cheater. The former Counter-Strike pro still needs to cycle to Copenhagen for the first CS2 Major and is expected to complete the journey tomorrow, essentially having cycled about a thousand kilometers in eight days.",

The Bloodline member once again sounded off Mama Rhodes about the promise he had recently made. This prompted Dustin Rhodes to take to X (formerly Twitter), reacting to a recent tweet by The Rock. In a now-deleted tweet, the former WWE Superstar threatened to drop The Final Boss.\n\n\"You're not Black Adam. You're gonna get your Hollywood a** dropped. Rhodes>Bloodline,\" wrote Dustin\n\nDustin and Cody both have history with The Rock's cousin, Roman Reigns. During Reigns' days in The Shield, The Rhodes brothers had defeated Reigns and Seth Rollins to win the WWE Tag Team Championship.\n\nFast forward to 2024, Cody is set to team up with Rollins to face The Rock and Reigns at WrestleMania 40 on Night One in a high-stakes tag team match.\n\nShawn Michaels commented on Cody Rhodes' upcoming match against Roman Reigns\n\nShawn Michaels has commented on Cody Rhodes' upcoming match against Roman Reigns. The Heart Break Kid hyped up the upcoming WrestleMania 40 show, claiming it would be the biggest WrestleMania of all time.\n\nSpeaking on the Busted Open Podcast, Michaels explained the consequences of The American Nightmare losing once again on The Grandest Stage of Them All. Michaels said that even if Rhodes is unable to complete his story this year, does not mean he never will.\n\n\"WrestleMania 40 is gonna be the biggest WrestleMania of all time, I have no doubt. It's gonna be a huge moment if Cody can make that [win the championship] happen. But, look, we've seen before that the story doesn't get told as they say. So, if it happens, it'll be absolutely glorious moment for him and a huge recognition of what he had accomplished. But if Roman says it isn't happening and he goes out there and makes that so, it's a big hill to climb. Let's just put it that way. [So, the story doesn't have to end if Cody loses, correct?] Clearly, it doesn't if he loses,\" said Michaels\n\nOn Night Two of WrestleMania 40, Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns will cross paths again in a rematch from last year's main event. The American Nightmare had to settle for a loss the last time after Solo Sikoa interfered in the match helping the champion retain his title.",

Wolfe added she heard the conversation got \"a little awkward.\"\n\nJohnson shot down the report Thursday on the social media platform X, saying: \"All this nonsense about a heated argument between Coach Saleh and me at the league meeting is absolutely false. It is yet another irresponsible report from NFL Network. Please disregard.\"\n\nNFL Network is owned by the NFL and is part of NFL Media, which includes the TV network, NFL Films, NFL.com, NFL Now, NFL RedZone and NFL Mobile.\n\nWolfe apologized in a statement posted on X on Thursday for the \"unnecessary distraction\" her comments caused, adding she didn't intend to break news with them.\n\n\"Regarding my comments surrounding the Jets on the @AroundTheNFL podcast: no, I was not at the Annual Meeting and yes, I was told of the exchange between head coach Robert Saleh & Woody Johnson by someone in attendance,\" Wolfe said in her post. \"Others on-site Sunday night have since reached out and described the interaction differently. My intent wasn't to break news, I leave that to the insiders.\n\n\"My sincerest apologies to the Jets organization for the unnecessary distraction during such a crucial part of their offseason.\"\n\nSaleh, entering his fourth year with New York, and the Jets are coming off a 7-10 season during which quarterback Aaron Rodgers tore his left Achilles tendon four plays into his debut.\n\nNew York has the longest active playoff drought among the four major North American sports leagues at 13 consecutive seasons. Johnson told reporters at NFL Honors in Las Vegas last month he expects the team -- including Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas -- to show major improvements this season.\n\n\"I think they all got the message,\" Johnson said then. \"This is it. This is the time to go. We've got to produce this year.\"\n\nSaleh spoke to reporters Monday at the NFL meetings, saying Johnson's message has helped the Jets progress during the offseason and will continue to do so during the regular season.\n\n\"His words are always welcome,\" Saleh said. \"He's the owner of the football team, and his frustrations are shared with everyone.\"",

This is the only way we can win. It was one of our most emotional games.\n\n\"It is an amazing feeling. I am very happy because it is another dream come true. A big thank you to our fans, they helped us through these difficult times amazingly.\"\n\nCoach Serhiy Rebrov said in the build-up to the Iceland match that it was hard for his team to concentrate on football.\n\n\"The missiles are flying every day. Our mission is to show that we're all alive and fighting against the Russians and that we need Europe's support,\" Rebrov said.\n\nHe added that his players were \"watching the news about the shelling of Odessa and Kyiv (and made) even more angry and eager to show our potential on the football field\".\n\nUkraine players celebrate with their fans after qualifying for the Euro 2024 finals in Germany. -- AFP\n\nThe coach hailed the \"character of our players and our nation\" to keep going in a qualifying campaign where, as refugees from the war themselves, Ukraine have staged 'home' matches spread across Europe.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the team's resilience in difficult times.\n\n\"Thank you, team. For the important victory and making it to Euro,\" Zelenskiy said in a post on X.\n\n\"For proving once again, whenever Ukrainians face difficulties they do not give up and continue to fight, Ukrainians certainly win.\n\n\"In times, when the enemy tries to destroy us, we demonstrate every day that Ukrainians are and will be. Ukraine is, and will be! Glory to Ukraine!\"\n\nUkraine successfully completed their qualification mission in Poland, which has the largest concentration of Ukrainian refugees of any country.\n\nStill, it has been no easy path to the finals.\n\nRebrov's side came through a tough qualifying group that included European champions Italy and runners-up England, managing draws against both sides.\n\nIt followed the disappointment of losing to Wales in a playoff for a place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, after which former Ukraine striker Rebrov took over in June last year.\n\nJubilant Ukraine fans at the Stadion Miejski Wroclaw in Poland. -- Reuters\n\nWith Roman Yaremchuk and Artem Dovbyk in attack, the pace of winger Mykhailo Mudryk, guile of Zinchenko in midfield and steel of Illya Zabarnyi and Vitaliy Mykolenko at the back, Ukraine have a capable squad.\n\nWhat they have proven now is that they can battle against the odds in the face of adversity and win the day, hoping that will become a unifying message for the country.\n\n\"It was very difficult to be on the coaching bench today, I saw how difficult it was for the guys,\" Rebrov said.\n\n\"I am grateful to all of them for this gift for our country.

        "title": "The Road To A New McCarthyism",
        "body": "Authored by Bert Olivier via The Brownstone Institute,\n\nI wonder how many people have recoiled with horror at what happened in the House of Representatives recently. I am referring to the decision, effectively, to ban the social media platform, TikTok, in the United States (to 'protect Americans from foreign adversaries'), because it supposedly affords the Chinese government the opportunity to 'spy' on Americans and manipulate their thinking.\n\nWell, one thing is sure - judging by the margin by which this motion was adopted by the House, and the quality of some of the opinions aired on the topic (that I have listened to), there was precious little thinking going on around the room, with some notable exceptions (352 votes for, 65 against), such as Representative Thomas Massie (R) of Kentucky. What thinking there was - such as the excellent argument put forward by Massie - was not sufficient to sway the rest of the delegates in the direction of common sense.\n\nSo what was this non-debate about TikTok all about? Most readers would probably already know about it, but it bears repeating, lest the intricacies of the hidden assumptions escape one's attention. In sum, as mentioned earlier, it comes down to the claim that China is using TikTok to spy on American citizens, and in addition to influence their thinking and behaviour. This, despite the glaring fact that - as Clayton and Natali Morris argue in the first video linked above - the US spies on its own citizens with impunity, not to mention that it also conducts espionage on China.\n\nThe two investigative reporters of Redacted further highlight the remarkable speed with which the US Congress has addressed the putatively urgent issue concerning TikTok, while allowing the arguably far more urgent matter of thousands of illegal immigrants streaming across the American border to continue unabated. The further irony is, of course - also stressed by the Morris duo - that these illegal immigrants include a far more salient 'Chinese threat;' namely, the large numbers of young, 'military age' Chinese men. And yet, the border issue is clearly not seen in the same light of urgency as TikTok!\n\nShould the US Senate confirm the House's vote to ban this short video app (application) - which is likely - thousands, if not millions of Americans who depend on it for their livelihood, would be left high and dry. This does not seem to have bothered the members of the House either.\n\nBut most egregiously, it is either lost on the members of the House, or they wittingly connive at the fact that this Act will endow the American President - Joe Biden, at present - with tremendous powers to control anything deemed to be under the influence of so-called 'foreign adversaries,' real or imagined. 'Anything' here includes not only comparable apps, but internet platforms and websites too. So, if X (formerly Twitter) is regarded by the incumbent of the presidency, for whatever reason, as posing a threat to US citizens in terms of influence or 'manipulation' by 'foreign adversaries,' it could be banned. It is redundant to emphasise the dictatorial potential of such a situation, but we'll get to it later, anyway.\n\nIn Thomas Massie's speech to the House he makes a telling distinction: while other speakers described TikTok as a Chinese 'Trojan horse,' he perspicaciously turns this metaphor back on the bill itself, insisting that it is itself the real Trojan horse. On March 12 he warned that anyone who thought it was not a Trojan horse would have to explain why there is a very telling exclusion in it, namely (quoting from the bill):\n\nThe term 'covered company' does not include an entity that operates a website, desktop application, mobile application, or augmented or immersive technology application whose primary purpose is to allow users to post product reviews, business reviews, or travel information and reviews.\n\nThis exclusion hides more than it shows Why? Because the exclusion pertains to 'entities' that are innocuous from a political point of view. But what about platforms like Rumble, X, or BitChute which, unlike YouTube and Facebook, are not censored, and therefore include many items to which the current regime (being part of the neo-fascist cabal) is hugely allergic? In other words, once signed into law, this Trojan horse bill could attack Americans from inside the walls of Troy, as it were, at the whim of the head honcho in the White House. And one need not add that, in the hands of its present occupant it would be a weapon of mass despotism.\n\nIronically, Senator Rand Paul's insights concerning the House decision bring to light the unacknowledged lies and cover-ups lurking behind the ostensibly 'open' debate preceding the voting. He did not waste any time commenting (in the first video linked above) that:\n\nReactionaries who want to ban TikTok claim the data can't be secured because the 'algorithm' is in China.\n\nNot true.\n\nThe truth is the algorithm runs in the US in Oracle cloud with their review of the code. (NOT in China.)\n\nMaybe we should examine the facts before committing violations of the 1st and 5th Amendments.\n\nThey want to ban TikTok because it's 'owned by China.'\n\nNot true.\n\n60% of the company is owned by US and international investors.\n\n20% is owned by the company founders.\n\n20% is owned by company employees, including over 7,000 Americans.\n\nThe CEO of TikTok is from Singapore, not China.\n\nSo ask yourself why they keep repeating this lie to scare you?\n\nIn characteristically courageous fashion, Rand Paul did not hesitate to expose the lies that were bandied about in the House, neatly repudiating them by providing the true state of affairs in each case. But he did not stop there. This was followed by:\n\nMy statement on the House TikTok ban.\n\nThe passage of the House TikTok ban is not just a misguided overreach; it's a draconian measure that stifles free expression, tramples constitutional rights, and disrupts the economic pursuits of millions of Americans.\n\nWith an iron fist, Congress dictated an unrealistic and narrow path for divestment, effectively banning TikTok and ignoring its substantial investments in data security.\n\nThis act is not securing our nation - it's a disturbing gift of unprecedented authority to President Biden and the Surveillance State that threatens the very core of American digital innovation and free expression.\n\nJoe Biden must be overjoyed, licking his lips at the thought of having been gifted with the dubious means to silence his critics and opponents at will, at the cost of Americans and people in the rest of the world being informed through available sources of their choice. It would amount to a situation hardly distinguishable from one where the state owns all the media - in other words, an unadulterated dictatorship. That is, unless it is stopped at the Senate level, which is unlikely.\n\nOne wonders whether the outcome of Murthy vs. Missouri, before the Supreme Court today (March 18), dealing as it does with the troubling issue of censorship (and therefore with the implications and purview of the First Amendment), would have a noticeable retrospective effect on the TikTok ban, which - at bottom - relates to the same question.\n\nWhat is astonishing about all of this is the apparent ease and rapidity with which the bill passed through the House, as Clayton Morris points out in the first video, linked above, highlighting the contrasting lack of interest in actively tackling the undeniable problem of unchecked ingress of illegal immigrants at American borders (referred to earlier). In a country which has always boasted about having the First Amendment, or rather, what it stands for - freedom of speech - which implies guaranteeing the continued existence of those sources of information which make freedom of expression possible, one might have expected the results of the vote to have been the other way around.\n\nAs it stands, is it far-fetched to read in these results the degree to which the collective mindset in the US has already morphed into one that is, incomprehensible as it may seem, receptive to despotic rule? I think not. The neo-fascist technocrats, who must surely have regarded the United States as the biggest hurdle to cross in their quest for world domination, must be writhing with uncontrollable convulsions of glee at present. After all, they are witnessing the crumbling of this erstwhile 'bastion of freedom,' which their puppet in the White House and his minions have set in motion with relative ease, it would seem.\n\nA situation such as the one briefly sketched above as a distinct possibility, would eerily resemble what was the case in the early 1950s in the United States, which went by the name of the 'Red Scare.' The Eisenhower Library (online) provides this useful sketch of this lamentable episode in American history:\n\nSenator Joseph R. McCarthy was a little-known junior senator from Wisconsin until February 1950 when he claimed to possess a list of 205 card-carrying Communists employed in the US Department of State. From that moment Senator McCarthy became a tireless crusader against Communism in the early 1950s, a period that has been commonly referred to as the 'Red Scare.' As chairman of the Senate Permanent Investigation Subcommittee, Senator McCarthy conducted hearings on communist subversion in America and investigated alleged communist infiltration of the Armed Forces. His subsequent exile from politics coincided with a conversion of his name into a modern English noun 'McCarthyism,' or adjective, 'McCarthy tactics,' when describing similar witch hunts in recent American history. [The American Heritage Dictionary gives the definition of McCarthyism as: 1. The political practice of publicizing accusations of disloyalty or subversion with insufficient regard to evidence; and 2. The use of methods of investigation and accusation regarded as unfair, in order to suppress opposition. Senator McCarthy was censured by the US Senate on December 2, 1954 and died May 2, 1957.]\n\nSeveral things strike one in this excerpt, the first of which is the phrase 'witch hunts,' with its disquieting connotations of persecuting people on the basis of flimsy, but 'useful' evidence of supposed malpractice of some kind - such as having a black cat, metaphorically speaking, equivalents of which could include 'misinformation,' disinformation,' and even (God forbid) 'malinformation,' all of which have been thoroughly tainted, from a mainstream perspective, with connotations of proverbial witchcraft. The TikTok ban would allow members of the Biden Inquisition to scream 'Witch!' at anything which does not gel with the official narrative, such as the items found on X, Children's Health Defense, or BitChute, to mention only some likely candidates.\n\nThen there is the related American Heritage Dictionary's illuminating description, quoted in the excerpt above, which links McCarthyism explicitly with the 'political practice of publicizing accusations of disloyalty or subversion with insufficient regard to evidence' as well as with 'the use of methods of investigation and accusation regarded as unfair, in order to suppress opposition.' To anyone with a modicum of comprehension of what is at stake, this would appear to be uncannily apposite. Given its track record, could anyone expect of the Biden administration any 'regard to (contrary) evidence' where accusations of disinformation are concerned? Or the employment of 'methods of investigation' that are fair? Give me a break!\n\nTo sum up by using a currently popular term, Biden and his DOJ would 'weaponise' the TikTok ban to the hilt, to the detriment of the citizens of the US as well as American democracy. And make no mistake: democracy may never recover from what threatens to become nothing less than McCarthyism on steroids. While one has access to the means for resisting this conspicuous act of usurping the constitutionally 'guaranteed' rights and freedoms of the American people, one must avail oneself of these - before they disappear.",

May God guide and keep you and your families in good health, and lift your spirits,\" the President prayed.\n\nDifferent speakers at the dinner expressed gratitude for the opportunity to come together in the spirit of Ramadan to share a meal with the President and renew the bonds of friendship that unite the nation.\n\nVice-President Kashim Shettima emphasized the pivotal roles of religious and traditional rulers in promoting peace and unity, urging them to continue to ''build bridges that transcend ethnic and religious divides.''\n\nThe Vice-President expressed delight that the nation's economy is on a rebound, noting the strengthening of the naira against the dollar.\n\n\"The President means well for the nation, and he has continued to redefine the meaning and concept of modern leadership.\n\n\"For many years, fuel subsidy was an albatross. The President took a bold decision from day one, and he hit the ground running. Now the economy is turning the corner,\" the Vice-President said.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Traditional Rulers Council of Nigeria, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, assured the President of the unwavering support of traditional rulers and commended the government's efforts to address the hike in food prices and the security challenges.\n\n\"You are not alone, Mr. President. The prices of food items and goods are gradually coming down. You are doing your best on security, and we cannot allow you to do it alone. We will join hands to support your vision for the betterment of our nation,\" the Ooni said.\n\nAmbassador Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli, Emir of Zazzau, speaking on behalf of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), highlighted the significance of Ramadan as a period of reflection, empathy, and unity.\n\nOn the security situation in the country, the Emir of Zazzau, who represented the Sultan of Sokoto and President General of NSCIA, expressed optimism that the country will return to peace and stability.\n\n\"I am happy to see representatives of Muslim and Christian communities in this room. I pray God Almighty blesses the President for him to do more to take the country to the Promised Land,\" the Emir prayed.\n\nApostle Samson Fatokun, General Secretary of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), noted that the Ramadan dinner with religious and traditional leaders, coincided with Maundy Thursday, the Thursday before Easter, observed in commemoration of Jesus Christ's institution of the Eucharist during the Last Supper.\n\nThe General Secretary, who delivered the address of CAN President, Archbishop Daniel Okoh, commended President Tinubu for fostering a harmonious relationship between the State and the Church.\n\n\"We are encouraged that your administration has shown great determination in tackling the challenges of kidnapping and banditry and bringing to justice the perpetrators of this dastardly act.\n\n\"We shall continue to show our support to your administration so that you can execute your noble intention for the nation,\" CAN General Secretary said.",

        "title": "David Archuleta Reveals His Mom's Text After 'Hell Together'  --  About Her Leaving the Mormon Church  --  Came Out (Exclusive)",
        "body": "Days later, she texted him saying she had also decided to step away from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In an Instagram video explaining the inspiration behind his new single \"Hell Together,\" which came out on Thursday, the American Idol alum said, \"She [texted], 'I don't want to be somewhere where my children don't feel welcomed, loved, and accepted ... if you're going to Hell, we are all going to Hell with you.' \"\n\nToday, nearly 17 months after stepping back from his Mormon faith, he shared the sweet text his mom sent him after \"Hell Together\" came out.\n\n\"We spoke last night over text,\" Archuleta tells PEOPLE. \"We don't usually talk a lot, but she joined my YouTube livestream premiering the 'Hell Together' lyric video and it was fun to have her there! She just said after the livestream: '\ud83d\ude18 Great job sweetheart \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.' \"\n\nAfter revealing the text exchange, the \"Crush\" hitmaker thanked her.\n\n\"Thanks, Mom, for teaching me how to love someone even when you don't fully understand their experience and it can be scary to be open to understand,\" Archuleta says. \"It meant a lot to see she was willing to go to Hell with me and back to make sure I wasn't alone in my journey.\"\n\nHe then offered a message to other parents of LGBTQ+ children.\n\n\"Not all families do that for their queer kids or for their kids who leave their religion,\" he adds. \"So I hope [other parents] can take into consideration that they may not have to leave their religion to love their kids, but they don't have to leave their kids to love their religion either. You can still love your kids even if they don't stay with what you had in mind for them.\"\n\nThe new song has been well-received by fans and friends. In another Instagram video posted on Thursday, Archuleta plays \"Hell Together\" for three of his friends and music collaborators -- popular violinist Lindsey Stirling and viral singers Anthony Gargiula and Jonathan Tilkin -- to listen to in a car before it was released to get their instant reactions.\n\n\"It was really heartwarming to get friends who I love and respect for their music talents reacting to the song and being touched by it,\" Archuleta says.\n\nThe \"Afraid to Love\" singer also faced some haters upon the song's release, with one person messaging him, \"Can't you walk away quietly!!??? What is it that you think you have to announce to the world that you're leaving the church!? Just leave! I don't get it! Please explain!!!\"\n\nArchuleta shared that direct message on his Instagram story, answering the person's questions with: \"Because I was told to be quiet for too long about my sexuality and I think it's fair for me to tell my story and my truth. As someone in the public eye I share things I feel are important and part of my journey and this is part of my life and journey as it is for many others.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe out-and-proud artist is hopeful people can understand his years-long journey navigating faith and sexuality, especially under the spotlight.\n\n\"It's not always easy,\" Archuleta admits. \"There can be heartbreak and it can be scary going into the unknown into transitioning out of faith or into accepting yourself as a queer person.\n\n\"It makes a world of a difference to have your loved ones supporting you. I am so grateful my mom and the rest of my family were there for me.\"",

        "title": "Third lawsuit filed in connection with boat crash near Port Miami",
        "body": "Injured passenger has yet to regain consciousness, according to family's lawyer\n\nA new lawsuit has been filed against the companies involved in a terrifying boat crash near Port Miami last month, which left more than a dozen people injured.\n\nStephanie and Matthew Camarato were on board the Thriller tour boat on Feb. 11 when a 43-foot charter boat, the Obelix, crashed into them.\n\n\"Everybody's having a good time one minute,\" said attorney Jack Hickey. \"The next minute their lives are shattered, changed forever.\"\n\nHickey is representing the Camaratos. They allege in a lawsuit that Stephanie, a mother of four, was struck in the head, leaving her with life-threatening injuries.\n\n\"Stephanie Camarato is by far the most seriously injured passenger and person involved in that horrendous crash,\" Hickey said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, her husband Matthew also suffered head injuries, a severely dislocated shoulder, and fractured ribs.\n\n\"We have, you know, we have these two vessels which are obviously on a collision course,\" Hickey said. \"And neither of them neither of them does anything.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims both boats engaged in \"excessive speed and dangerous maneuvering to give thrills to passengers on board... and ... neither vessel maintained a proper lookout.\"\n\nNBC6 Investigators asked Thriller Miami about the lawsuit. An attorney for the company provided the following statement:\n\nThriller Miami, LLC, a family owned and operated company that is proud to call Miami home, is deeply saddened and shocked by the accident on February 11, 2024., which has affected both our passengers as well as crew and our own families. First and foremost, we wish for the speedy and complete recovery of the passengers who were injured. Thriller Miami has been in business for over 18 years, and this is the first time an incident like this has occurred which is a testament to our commitment to prioritize customer safety. We understand that there is a lot of speculation and curiosity about the accident, but we ask everyone to refrain from making any assumptions until all the facts are established. We thank the U.S. Coast Guard, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Miami Fire Rescue boats and all others who responded so quickly. We trust that the investigators will conduct a thorough and fair inquiry and out of respect for that process, we will not comment on their investigation or our understanding as to how this incident occurred until it is appropriate to do so. We appreciate your continuing patience and support through this challenging situation.\n\n\"Sadly, incidents and accidents do happen on the water in general,\" said Jesus Porrata, the lead marine investigator for the United States Coast Guard in Miami, the agency looking into what happened.\n\n\"The only thing I can say at this point, the matter is still under investigation,\" he added. \"But obviously something went wrong that day.\"\n\nNBC6 Investigators rode along with a crew from Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Fireboat 73, which responds to incidents out of Port Miami.\n\n\"We happen to live in paradise, and paradise can change in an instant,\" said MDFR firefighter Rob Johnson. \"It takes merely seconds...and things can go to hell in a handbasket very, very quickly.\"\n\nThe area where the crash happened is known as Fisherman's Channel -- east of downtown Miami's Bayside near Port Miami. It's an area often congested area with various speed zones and ever-changing conditions above and below the water's surface.\n\n\"What complicates this area here is you have Bayside area, Miami Beach Marina down that way,\" said MDFR firefighter Nick DiGiacomo. \"You have multiple marinas, and that's sort of like the intersection.\"\n\nFirst responders warn conditions and speed zones change based on a boat's location, and it's critical to be aware and boat responsibly.\n\n\"We talk about rules of the road and boating according to your conditions,\" Johnson explained. \"If you're in a congested environment, we obviously slow down and exercise, due caution.\"\n\nThe Camarato's is the third lawsuit filed in connection with the crash. Meanwhile, Stephanie Camarato remains hospitalized in South Florida, far from her family in Illinois and fighting for her life.\n\n\"That's over a month at Jackson Memorial Hospital,\" Hickey said. \"She's still being treated as a trauma patient there.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard said they are investigating whether the Obelix was operating an illegal charter. A representative of Midnight Sun Charters, which owns the boat, told NBC6 Investigators the captain was properly licensed but was not carrying his credentials at the time. An attorney representing the company said he was not able to comment on the pending lawsuit.",

        "title": "Jared Triolo delivers game-winning RBI, Jose Hernandez earns save as Pirates win opener",
        "body": "The Marlins' Jazz Chisholm Jr. scores ahead of the tag of Pirates catcher Henry Davis the third inning Thursday, in Miami.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates got an extra-inning Opening Day win, thanks to a hit by a player in his first season opener and a save by a pitcher who wasn't even supposed to be on the active roster.\n\nJared Triolo singled to drive in the game-winning run in the top of the 12th inning, and left-hander Jose Hernandez finished off the Miami Marlins for a 6-5 victory in the season opener Thursday afternoon at loadDepot park.\n\nTriolo delivered his heroics with two outs in the 12th. With automatic runner Ke'Bryan Hayes at second base and Oneil Cruz at first after being intentionally walked, Triolo hit a bloop single to right field to score Hayes for the go-ahead run. Shortstop Tim Anderson cut off the throw to the plate with caught Triolo between first and second, but turned to throw Cruz out at home to end the rally.\n\nHernandez, added to the Opening Day roster only after Roansy Contreras was placed on the MLB paternity leave list, earned his first career save by recording the final three outs.\n\nPirates starter Mitch Keller, who signed a five-year, $77 million contract extension on Feb. 23, allowed five runs (four earned) on seven hits and two walks while striking out three on 85 pitches in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Pirates rallied behind home runs by Bryan Reynolds, Edward Olivares and Oneil Cruz to send the game into extra innings.\n\nThe Marlins scored a pair of runs off Keller in the second inning. Jazz Chisholm Jr. fouled off three pitches with a full count before drawing a leadoff walk, advanced to third on Jake Burger's single to center and scored on a grounder to short by Jesus Sanchez for a 1-0 lead.\n\nPirates shortstop fielded Sanchez's grounder and fed Triolo at second base, but Triolo lost the ball during the transfer while trying to turn a double play and both runners were safe. Tim Anderson followed with a double to the right field corner to score Burger and make it 2-0.\n\nThe Pirates tied it up in the third, when Connor Joe drew a one-out walk and Bryan Reynolds sent an elevated 2-1 sinker 406 feet to left-center for the first home run of the season.\n\nMiami scored two more in the third for a 4-2 edge, as the Pirates failed to turn another double play. After a Josh Bell leadoff single, Bryan De La Cruz hit a comebacker to Keller but his throw to second for the forceout pulled Triolo off the bag and prevented him from turning two.\n\nChisholm doubled to put runners on second and third, and Jake Burger followed with a two-run single to left as Chisholm beat Reynolds' throw from left and slid past catcher Henry Davis' tag attempt at the plate.\n\nBurger drove in another run for the Marlins for a 5-2 lead in the fifth. Bell drew a leadoff walk, advanced to second on a single by De La Cruz and to third when Chisholm flied out to right and scored on Burger's sacrifice fly to left.\n\nLuzardo left after striking out eight and throwing 85 pitches in five innings, and the Pirates loaded the bases against righty George Soriano as Reynolds drew a leadoff walk, Hayes singled to center and Davis beat the throw on a roller to short. The Marlins turned to lefty Andrew Nardi, who got both Cruz and Triolo looking at called third strikes to escape unscathed.\n\nPirates manager Derek Shelton had righty-hitting Edward Olivares, acquired from Kansas City in the offseason, pinch-hit for the lefty Tellez to face Nardi in the seventh. In his Pirates debut, Olivares drove an 0-1 four-seamer 413 feet to left-center for a home run to cut it to 5-3.\n\nIt was the third career pinch-hit homer for Olivares, who became the third Pirate to hit a pinch-hit homer on Opening Day. He joins Nate McLouth (2007) and John Vander Wal (2000), who also did so in his Pirates debut. Olivares became the first player to homer in his Pirates debut since Ke'Bryan Hayes on Sept. 1, 2020 at the Chicago Cubs.\n\nAfter Taylor singled to center, the Marlins replaced Nardi with Anthony Bender. Reynolds hit a one-out double that bounced over the right field fence, putting runners on second and third, before Hayes drew a walk to load the bases for Andrew McCutchen.\n\nMcCutchen, sitting one homer shy of his career 300th, hit a chopper to short that scored Taylor to trim the deficit to 5-4. But Bender got Davis swinging at a 2-2 sinker for a strikeout to end the rally.\n\nCruz started the eighth by connecting on a Sixto Sanchez 96-mph fastball on the outside corner for a 384-foot, opposite-field blast to tie the game at 5-5. It marked his second consecutive Opening Day with a homer - he hit a solo shot in the 5-4 win at Cincinnati last year - to become the fifth player in team history to accomplish the feat.\n\nThe Pirates had a scoring chance in the ninth against lefty Tanner Scott, who walked Joe and Hayes but got McCutchen looking at a called third strike on a full-count slider at the bottom of the strike zone. Davis worked a full count before hitting a line drive that Burger snagged at third.\n\nThe Pirates had two runners thrown out at home plate by Bell in extra innings. They started the 10th with Davis on second base as the automatic runner. Davis tried to score when Burger's throw from third to first skipped past Bell. But Bell's throw to the plate beat Davis, who was caught between the bases and tagged out.\n\nTaylor started the 11th inning at second base as the automatic runner and advanced to third on Joe's groundout to second but was out at home when Reynolds hit a grounder to Bell, who made another perfect throw to catcher Nick Fortes at the plate.\n\nIn the bottom of the 10th, with De La Cruz at second, the Pirates intentionally walked Chisholm. That set up a double play ball on Burger's grounder to second, thanks to a spectacular stretch by Joe at first to catch Cruz's throw that was low and wide of the bag.\n\nOrtiz got out of a jam in the bottom of the 11th. After intentionally walking Vidal Brujan to put runners on the corners with one out, he got pinch hitter Jonah Bride to ground into a 5-4-3 double play to end the inning.",

        "title": "Communist Nicaragua Sentences Christian Pastors to 12-15 Years in Prison on Holy Week",
        "body": "The communist regime in Nicaragua announced the conviction of 11 pastors associated with the Evangelical Mountain Gateway ministry and humanitarian organization, this week on dubious and unspecified charges of \"money laundering,\" sentencing the accused to between 12 and 15 years in prison.\n\nNicaragua - led by the radical Marxist Sandinista regime of Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo - officially convicted the pastors on March 19, but handed down the sentences on Wednesday. Two of those arrested, pastors Walner Omier Bland\u00f3n Ochoa and wife Marisela de F\u00e1tima Mej\u00eda Ruiz, received 15-year sentences. The other ten - Marcos Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez Jir\u00f3n, Harry Lening Rios Bravo, Manuel de Jes\u00fas R\u00edos Flores, Jos\u00e9 Luis Orozco Urrutia, \u00c1lvaro Daniel Escobar Caldera, Juan Carlos Chavarr\u00eda Zapata, Juan Luis Moncada, Orvin Alexis Moncada Castellano, and C\u00e9sar Facundo Burgalin Miranda - received 12-year sentences. All faced charges of \"aggravated money laundering.\"\n\nIn addition, according to the Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa, the court imposed a fine of $80 million per pastor arrested - nearly a billion dollars in fines - and two attorneys attempting to aid in the defense of the Christians, Isabel Cristina Acevedo Sol\u00eds and Maricarmen Espinoza Segura, were sentenced to ten years in prison and similarly fined tens of millions of dollars.\n\nBoth Mountain Gateway and ADF International, a faith-based legal advocacy organization, denounced the entire case as a \"sham.\" ADF International is helping Mountain Gateway appeal the case and presented the case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights seeking measures to protect the prisoners of conscience.\n\n\"ADF International has asked the Commission to demand that Nicaragua ensure the right to health, life, and physical integrity of the pastors during their stay in prison, while the proceedings are ongoing,\" the group said in a press release on Wednesday.\n\n\"In addition to being barred from meeting with their legal representation or their families, the lawyers on the case were denied access to case files and other relevant documentation against the pastors,\" the organization denounced. \"During the sham trial, the government was unable to produce any evidence of the alleged illicit activity or where the alleged unlawful funds that were 'laundered' originated.\"\n\nThe incident is the latest in a campaign of brutal and often violent repression of Christians in the majority-Christian country, timed to coincide with Holy Week in the non-Orthodox Christian world, a period during which Christians observe the crucifixion of Jesus and celebrate his resurrection.\n\nThe Sandinista regime has previously timed its acts of repression against the Christian faith to align with Christian holidays; the regime abruptly seized Mountain Gateway's assets and arrested the pastors involved shortly before Christmas. Also in late December, Sandinista authorities arrested Catholic Bishop Isidoro Mora, as he had presided over a Mass during which those congregated prayed for imprisoned and persecuted members of the Catholic clergy.\n\nThe Sandinistas have also deployed police officers to silence Christians attempting to participate in traditional religious events such as the celebration in December of the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\n\nThe repression has not been limited to churches and faith organizations. Ortega has shut down more than 3,500 nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations since 2018, when mass anti-communist protests in the country, in part fueled by Christian teachings, erupted. The Ortega-Murillo regime killed more than 300 people in 2018 in response to the peaceful movement against their ideology.\n\nMountain Gateway is an organization founded by American Pastor Jon Britton Hancock that initially worked almost exclusively to offer humanitarian aid to Nicaraguans after natural disasters and advice and support to farmers in remote parts of the country. Last year, Hancock began organizing mass evangelizing events for prayer, reflection, and community, attracting as many as 200,000 people at a time.\n\n\"We saw a massive move of God involving hundreds of thousands of people. That has been a tremendous influence in the hearts of the people of Nicaragua,\" Hancock told Breitbart News in February.\n\nMountain Gateway had announced plans for at least 13 evangelizing campaign events in the country in 2024, receiving no negative feedback from the government or any indication that it would face resistance. Before it could plan the events, however, their local pastors were arrested, accused of \"money laundering\" and \"organized crime,\" and the Sandinistas levied criminal charges against Hancock and two other Americans, son Jacob Britton Hancock and daughter-in-law Cassandra Mae Hancock, on unspecified charges.\n\n\"I do think that the size of the Gospel Campaigns and the amount of people they drew could be seen as threatening to the government,\" Hancock told Breitbart News. \"Again, I'm not sure why they are targeting us after we have worked to maintain a respectful relationship and abide by their policies and laws.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Hancock issued a statement reiterating the organization's faith and confirming Mountain Gateway would continue its campaign to defend its pastors.\n\n\"While we are certainly dismayed at the formal conviction of our colleagues and friends in Nicaragua, we remain steadfast in our hope that God is in control,\" Hancock said. \"We will do everything in our power to secure justice for friends in Nicaragua, and we ask you to join us in praying for their safety and swift release.\"",

        "title": "Dave Hyde: Extra innings, extra drama as Marlins latest rebuild officially starts",
        "body": "MIAMI -- On Opening Day, baseball officially happened to the Miami Marlins -- and plenty of it.\n\nBig hits. Timely pitches. Lost leads. Well-scripted hope giving way to the baseball nightmare of four Marlins relievers needed to get nine outs. Extra innings. Extra drama.\n\nAnd, sitting in the middle of it all, even in a 6-5 loss in 12 innings, were some storylines the Marlins need to help carry the faith across 161 more games.\n\nJesus Luzardo, the kid from Parkland, threw five innings and struck out eight Pittsburgh batters before leaving a 5-2 lead to the bullpen after 80 pitches. That's a beginning answer for an injured rotation.\n\nThe heart of the Marlins lineup, Josh Bell, Jazz Chisholm and Jake Burger, also got on base nine times in 12 trips to the plate with Burger having three RBI. Another good look for a desperate need. Can that nucleus remain a threat the next six months?\n\nIt was all enough to ignore the elephant in the room of the Marlins officially starting their latest makeover, complete with a symbolic trade-for-tomorrow on season's eve. Five years after Derek Jeter mightily and miserably started down Rebuilding Road, Peter Bendix starts down his as the new chief of baseball operations.\n\nOnce, such rebuilds brought outrage, like when team owner H. Wayne Huizenga tore down a champion, or at least a loud snarl of public emotion like when Jeffrey Loria fielded one of his low-payroll teams after a publicly-funded stadium was meant to end such problems.\n\nBy now, the not-near-sellout crowd of 32,564 represented the largest Opening Day attendance since 2016, suggesting there just aren't enough interested baseball fans in South Florida anymore. Anger has been replaced by apathy now, fury by fatalism.\n\nSo, a new era began with the two, divergent stories everyone has seen play out with the Marlins, again and again, playing out right on top of each other on Opening Day.\n\nFirst, there's the big-picture makeover of this franchise. That takes precedence over all else. Tampa Bay, the previous employer of Bendix, is the small-market model here. The shame of baseball is 20 teams follow this model in becoming a feeder system for the other 10.\n\nBendix made no pretense what this year is about by trading veteran Jon Berti to the New York Yankees on Wednesday. So, the Marlins unloaded a valuable utility player, $3.2 million in salary and got a couple of prospects who are expected to play in the minors this year.\n\n\"This trade probably helps us a little bit more in the future,'' Bendix said\n\nAll of which puts manager Skip Schumaker in an uncomfortable spot. He's working to win, directing his players to win, when winning is secondary this year. One Schumaker thought about Berti's trade stood out a few hours before Thursday's first pitch.\n\n\"I'm really happy for him,'' the manager said. \"He gets to go to a place that's got a chance to win it this year.\"\n\nHe didn't suggest the Marlins don't have a chance to win this year.\n\nUh, did he?\n\nSchumaker was manager of the year in pushing the Marlins to 84 wins and the playoffs last year. Las Vegas has their over-under at 78\u00bd wins this year. Give Schumaker the award again if the Marlins hit the over.\n\nThe Marlins begin with four regular starting pitchers hurt, one of whom, ace Sandy Alcantara, is out for the year. Pitching remains the considered strength of the team, too. Some of that's because, as Luzardo showed Thursday, there are still some good arms on this team.\n\nThe other part of that is the Marlins scored the fewest runs in the National League last year and then lost Jorge Soler's team-high 36 home runs to free agency. So the question entering the year is if by signing the reclamation project of Tim Anderson, by getting a healthy year from Chisholm and by getting seasons from Berger and Bell ....\n\nCan they not score the fewest runs again?\n\nCan they get their bullpen sorted out? Can the starting rotation return to health?",

        "title": "This Easter, Is Christianity Still Promulgating Antisemitism?",
        "body": "This Sunday, Christians around the world will celebrate the peace and renewal promised by Easter, but at the heart of Holy Week liturgies leading up to the feast are a set of texts that have had brutal consequences for Jews, not just in the past, but in the present. The Gospel narratives of the passion and death of Jesus have, across centuries, framed how Jews are perceived. The response to the tragic events now unfolding in Gaza and Israel requires a fresh look at this unresolved and expressly Christian quandary. The lesson may be familiar, but it has urgent relevance.\n\nAn unfathomed thermal current long running below the surface of a broad culture -- call it the culture of \"the West\" -- is still being tapped, even if unconsciously. That current was first generated roughly two thousand years ago, in the way that early followers of Jesus told the story of the Crucifixion, as a crime laid at the feet of the Jews. After the Holocaust made plain that the \"Christ-killer\" slander was part of what prepared the way for the mass murder of Jews, the trope was repudiated by the Second Vatican Council, in the 1965 declaration Nostra Aetate. \"What happened in His passion,\" the fathers of the Roman Catholic council said, \"cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today.\"\n\nBut there was a problem. The Gospels themselves explicitly lodge the Christ-killer charge: for example, in Matthew, which is often read at Mass on Palm Sunday, Pontius Pilate pronounces Jesus not guilty and makes an offer to release him, but an assembled crowd of Jews cries, \"Let him be crucified.\" Pilate then famously washes his hands, saying, \"I am innocent of the blood of this just person.\" At which point, the crowd replies, let \"his blood be on us, and on our children.\" And so it has been.\n\nDespite Nostra Aetate, neither the council fathers nor their successors put in place an effective educational structure that would enable people to understand that the narrative was most likely written not by eyewitnesses but by followers of Jesus in the late first century. Those second-generation Christians may not have known that Pilate was a brutal tyrant, or that any benign portrayal of him as being friendly toward a troublemaking nobody was surely false. The antagonism between the remembered Jesus and \"the Jews\" was one of which the actual Jesus would have known nothing. Though he participated in disputations that were normal in the Jewish community of his time -- such as debates over what exactly the Shabbat laws required, or what deference was due to Caesar -- he was in mortal conflict not with his own people but with the Roman government.\n\nSo how did this story come to be written? Jesus died in about 30 A.D. In the year 70, the Romans destroyed the second iteration of the Jerusalem Temple, which had anchored the faith of Judaism for hundreds of years. This act sparked an intense religious crisis: What was it to be a Jew without the Temple? For most, the answer lay in studying the Torah and, generally, the Hebrew Scriptures, and in the observance of halacha, or religious laws, including those governing Shabbat and the kosher diet. For some others, Jesus was becoming the new Temple, a transfiguration embodied in a prediction that the Gospel of John attributes to Jesus, referring to his own coming resurrection: \"Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\" The Jewish-Roman War, which continued intermittently for decades, fuelled this intra-Jewish dispute -- a familiar phenomenon, in which imperial overlords contrive to set subject peoples against themselves -- and the Gospels, written in the decades after the Temple's destruction, are a record of one side of that dispute. The phrase \"the Jews\" (in the Greek, \"hoi Ioudaioi\") appears more than a hundred and forty times in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, which follows them in the New Testament, and the name usually signifies the many Jews who disagreed with those Jews who saw Jesus as the Messiah; the latter were fewer in number, but their version of the story is what survived.\n\nBut the Christ-killer charge is not the largest problem. Inspired by the anti-Jewish slant in some passages of the Gospels, many Christians have tended to remember Jesus -- or, rather, misremember him -- as if he were not a Jew at all. To portray Jesus as merciful and large-hearted, the Gospels render Jews more broadly as law-obsessed and unloving: in Luke, for example, Jews refuse to help a wounded traveller waylaid by a robber, leaving his rescue to the Samaritan. Gospel Jews are the foil against which the Gospel Jesus can dazzle as flawless. The Pharisees, a Jewish sect committed to religious laws, are painted so darkly in the role of Jesus's antagonists that their name comes down to us as a synonym for hypocrites, not because that was so but because they were the forerunners of \"the Jews\" with whom the post-Temple Christians were in tension. In these ways, the \"Gospel truth\" boils down to a conflict of Jesus against the Jews. The first chapter of John declares, \"He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\" Not so. The only people who received Jesus in his lifetime -- his apostles and disciples -- were his own; they were Jewish.\n\nGradually, across the many years in which the Gospels took shape, Jesus came to be regarded as divine: he is depicted in John as saying, \"I and my Father are one.\" That made the purported crime of the Jews even worse, since the murder of God -- deicide -- is a cosmic transgression that's impossible to adjudicate, much less forgive. And belief in the divinity of Jesus further undercut his followers' ability to see him as a Jew. Judaism, after all, is a religion -- a form of mediation between finite humans and the infinite God. Once Jesus was conceived of in a permanent mystical union with the Godhead, he no longer had any need of a go-between. He had no need, that is, of Temple sacrifice, Torah study, Shabbat observance, praying the Psalms. In following such practices, he would just have been going through the motions. A divine Jesus would have been, in essence, a pretend Jew.\n\nThe Roman war culminated in a large-scale Jewish uprising in Judea that was ultimately crushed in the year 136, a catastrophe that precipitated the demise of the Jewish center of Jesus's movement. Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, gentile Christians -- originally from a variety of polytheistic, pagan, and local religious traditions -- began to dominate the nascent Church, and their reading of texts that emphasized Jesus's conflict with \"the Jews\" would have led them naturally to remember him as if he, too, were a gentile. That fantasy took hold in the Christian imagination. (Images of Jesus typically depict him with white European features and long-flowing brown hair.) \"Jesus against the Jews\" is Christianity's paradigmatic origin story, forming, in effect, a spoiled gene in the DNA of the Church. Because Christianity was the incubator of Western civilization, that gene was passed on. That origin story gave Christians and a Christianity-influenced culture a litany of oppositions: the Church against the Synagogue, the New Testament against the Old Testament, grace against law, faith against works, Easter against Passover, Sunday against Saturday, Portia against Shylock -- and always, the Christian God of Love against the Jewish God of Vengeance.",

        "body": "Dr Andareas Peter\n\n\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" - John 3:16\n\nGood Friday, a significant event in the Christian calendar, occurs on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday and is observed during Holy Week. It serves as a time of deep reflection and solemnity, marking the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Christians worldwide commemorate this day with reverence, contemplating the profound sacrifice made by Jesus for the redemption of humanity. Across the globe, churches hold special services and processions to honour the events of Good Friday, emphasizing themes of repentance, forgiveness, and salvation.\n\nWhen we say it is a Good Friday, people generally think that the day is about celebrating a cause of happiness. Unlike what the term implies, Good Friday is a day that Christians all over the world spend in sorrow. Good Friday is the day when people mourn the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Since it is the most significant and holiest day for Christians, people spend this day praying for the forgiveness of their sins. Good Friday is observed two days before Easter, which celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christians prepare themselves for 40 days by taking Lent before they enter the Holy Week, where they observe Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter.According to the religion of Christianity, people believe that the Almighty God had sent His only son, Jesus Christ, to save people from their sins and guide them on the righteous path. Jesus was born in this world as the son of Joseph and Mary and lived here as a man. Throughout his life, Jesus has been preaching about love and forgiveness and performed several miracles to make people believe in God and eternal life.\n\nThough Jesus continued to teach, some people did not consider him to be sent by God and hence started protesting against him. He was imprisoned and subjected to cruel punishments, which included intense beating with sharp weapons and carrying the heavy cross for long miles. It was after all this thrashing that he was nailed to the cross and put up to be ridiculed by others. The Good Friday emphasises that Jesus sacrificed himself to pay for the sins of humankind. Since this act is considered a win of good against evil, this day is called Good Friday, even though people lament the death of Jesus.\n\nThe historical roots of Good Friday trace back to the biblical accounts found in the New Testament. According to Christian belief, Jesus Christ was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by crucifixion by the Roman authorities in Jerusalem.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus represents a pivotal moment in Christian theology, symbolizing the atonement for human sins and the ultimate act of love and sacrifice. Christians regard Good Friday as a profound expression of God's mercy and grace towards humanity, as Jesus willingly endured suffering and death to offer redemption and eternal life. The significance of Good Friday extends beyond historical events; it holds deep spiritual meaning for Christians worldwide. It is a day of solemn reflection and contemplation, prompting believers to meditate on the profound love and forgiveness demonstrated through Christ's death on the cross. Good Friday serves as a reminder of the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in the Christian faith, emphasizing themes of redemption, reconciliation, and spiritual renewal. Through prayer, meditation, and worship, Christians seek to deepen their understanding of Christ's sacrifice and its implications for their lives.\n\nThroughout history, various traditions and observances have emerged around Good Friday, reflecting the diverse cultural and religious practices of Christian communities worldwide. Church services play a central role in Good Friday observances, featuring solemn liturgies, scripture readings, prayers, hymns, and reflections on the Passion narrative. Many churches also incorporate the Stations of the Cross, a series of devotions depicting Jesus' journey to the cross, into their Good Friday services.\n\nFasting and abstinence are common practices among Christians on Good Friday, symbolizing a spirit of penance, self-discipline, and solidarity with Christ's suffering. Believers abstain from meat and other luxuries as a form of spiritual discipline, seeking to emulate Jesus' sacrifice and draw closer to God through self-denial. Some Christians observe a strict fast throughout the day, while others may partake in one meal of bread and water or engage in partial fasting. Processions and rituals are also prevalent in many Christian communities on Good Friday. Some churches organize outdoor processions, re-enacting Jesus' journey to the cross, while others conduct indoor ceremonies that involve the veneration of the cross.\n\nThe veneration of the cross is a solemn ritual in which believers approach and kiss or touch a crucifix, symbolizing reverence for Christ's sacrifice and their commitment to following him. Good Friday is marked by a sense of quiet contemplation and reverence, with believers spending time in prayer, meditation, and reflection on the events of Jesus' crucifixion. It is a day to express gratitude for God's mercy and grace, acknowledging the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in bringing salvation and eternal life to humanity. As Christians observe Good Friday, they are reminded of the hope and redemption found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is celebrated joyously on Easter Sunday. It is a time for Christians to come together to pray, reflect, and remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. In addition to the traditional religious observances, many Christians also use Good Friday as a time to perform acts of charity and service to others. This is because the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is seen as a model of selflessness and love for others, and so Good Friday is an opportunity for Christians to follow in his footsteps. Overall, Good Friday is a solemn and meaningful day for Christians around the world. It is a time to remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, to reflect on the importance of selflessness and love for others, and to renew one's faith and commitment to Christian principles.",

        "body": "Why is Good Friday called Good Friday, and why are bunnies associated with Easter?\n\nThe name \"Good Friday\" seems a little bit misleading, considering it is the day that Jesus was crucified on the cross.\n\nGood Friday marks the first of the three holy days of Easter, symbolising the central message of the Christian faith - the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nREAD MORE: Freddie Flintoff's TV return confirmed after horror Top Gear crash\n\nREAD MORE: Camilla makes history as Charles absent due to cancer treatment\n\nGood Friday is the day Jesus was condemned to death and crucified on the cross by the Romans for being a perceived threat to authority.\n\nOn this day, Christians thank him for his sacrifice by taking the day to reflect, be silent, and fast.\n\nThe 15th hour of the day is widely considered to be the time he died, and so many liturgies are performed in churches at this time. He was then buried in a tomb the next day.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nThe day after that, on what we now know as the third day of Easter, the tomb Christ was buried in was found empty.\n\nIt was first believed the body had been stolen, despite constant guard presence - at least until Jesus appeared in front of his disciples, having overcome death.\n\nHe then ascended to Heaven, taking his place on the right hand of God, according to the Apostles' Creed.\n\nWhy is it called 'Good Friday'?\n\nThere are many theories as to why the holy day is known as \"Good\" Friday.\n\nFor instance, many believed that \"Good\" was an alternate spelling of \"God\", just as our modern word \"Goodbye\" came from the phrase \"God be with ye\".\n\nBut this theory has been largely debunked.\n\nREAD MORE: Charles hosts private audiences after skipping annual tradition\n\nREAD MORE: Star wasn't allowed to film without 'gruelling' 12-week program\n\n\"The origin from God is out of the question\" Professor Anatoly Liberman from the University of Minnesota told Slate.\n\nLinguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer seconded this, also telling Slate, \"None of the early examples in the Oxford English Dictionary imply that it started off as God's rather than Good, so I don't really see this as more than speculative etymology.\"\n\nIt's important to know that Good Friday isn't known as \"Good\" everywhere.\n\nThere are different names for it all around the world. There is a largely held misconception that the German phrase for the holiday is \"Gottes Freitag\", translating to \"God's Friday\", when it is actually Karfreitag, or \"Sorrowful Friday\".\n\nIn Russian, the phrase translates to \"Passion Friday\", whereas for the Romance languages, the word translates to \"Sacred Friday\".\n\n\"The answer seems pretty clearly to be that it's from good 'holy',\" said Jesse Sheidlower, the president of the American Dialect Society to Slate.\n\nREAD MORE: Charles gives first public address since Catherine's cancer announcement\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary additionally notes that there was once \"Good Wednesday\", the Wednesday before Easter, which is now more commonly known as \"Holy Wednesday\".\n\nThis helps contextualise the name of the holiday with the events that occurred on that day.\n\nDespite the rather tragic occurrence of Jesus Christ dying on the cross, without this event, there would be nothing to save his people from sin, thus making the name appropriate for the occasion, despite appearing otherwise.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic of Easter, why are bunnies associated with it?\n\nThe celebration of the pagan goddess Eostre, the goddess of fertility of humans and crops, was held during the Spring equinox, a time for rebirth and new life.\n\nThe German goddess' symbols included the rabbit (which are known as good breeders) and eggs (symbols of new life), as well as the colours green, purple, and yellow.\n\nThe tradition of the Easter bunny is believed to stem from the Eostre celebration, helped along by the arrival of German immigrants in America in the 1700s.\n\nAs Time reports, some sources believe that German immigrants brought with them their fable of an egg-laying hare called \"Osterhase\" or \"Oschter Haws\" who would deliver well-behaved children colored eggs in nests they made in their caps and bonnets before Easter.\n\nEggs eventually expanded to chocolate and other gifts, decorated baskets replaced hats, and children left out carrots for the bunny in case it got hungry from all it's hard work.\n\nThere is evidently much overlap with Easter, and many pagans believe Christians have adopted pagan traditions, aligning them with the narrative of the rebirth of Jesus Christ.",

        "body": "After flying 5,477 miles from Tokyo to Los Angeles to see Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani make his regular season home debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Hiroaki Miyazaki had one request.\n\n\"I hope Ohtani can give us a home run,\" the 71-year-old told AFP on Thursday as the Ohtani era at Dodger Stadium got under way with a regular-season home opener against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nIn the event, Ohtani was unable to add a 172nd homer to the 171 he accumulated during six seasons with the Dodgers' southern California rivals, the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nBut the 29-year-old, two-time American League Most Valuable Player who has earned comparisons to Babe Ruth did enough in a 7-1 victory to suggest that the $700 million the Dodgers splashed out to secure his services will be money well spent.\n\nA palpable sense of excitement rippled throughout Dodger Stadium hours before the first pitch as fans streamed into the iconic venue against a picture-perfect California backdrop of swaying palm trees and blue skies.\n\nIn one of the several mega-stores inside the stadium, long lines of fans queued patiently to pay for Ohtani-themed merchandise ranging from replica jerseys at $199 each to commemorative pennants and caps.\n\n\"We bought our season tickets today because of him,\" said Takeshi Kitada, a Los Angeles-based banker originally from Tokyo who believes the Dodgers paid a \"reasonable price\" to land Ohtani.\n\n\"It's a very a reasonable price -- just look at all the people here today purchasing the merchandise. The Dodgers can enjoy him.\"\n\nKitada was a regular visitor to Anaheim during Ohtani's stint with the Angels. \"Now we support the Dodgers,\" Kitada said with a smile.\n\nDodgers fan Ronald Nazario is convinced Ohtani will lead the Dodgers back to the World Series.\n\n\"We've been waiting for him since day one, since we acquired him,\" Nazario told AFP. \"We're ready for him to take off and win the next World Series, bring it back here to LA.\"\n\n- 'A special team' -\n\nGene Weisberg, a 69-year-old attorney and long-time Dodgers fan, says seeing Ohtani turn out for the franchise is \"special.\"\n\n\"Ohtani is an exciting player. Getting to see him every day is special. We've been season ticket holders for a very long time, so we've seen a lot of generations of players,\" Weisberg told AFP.\n\n\"They've put together a special team. I guess we'll have to see if they can perform -- injuries happen, other teams improved. But any time the baseball season starts, it's exciting.\"\n\nWeisberg, meanwhile, was circumspect about the scandal which emerged around Ohtani over his interpreter's links to illegal gambling.\n\n\"Let's wait and see,\" he said. \"I hope what he said is what actually happened. You never know.\"\n\nWhen the action finally got under way, Ohtani wasted no time in getting into the groove.\n\nFans rose to their feet in applause as the 6-foot-5 (1.95m) slugger walked up to the plate for his first at bat, and he duly returned the compliment by smashing a double deep into right field for his first hit at Dodger Stadium.\n\nThere was a slight sense of anti-climax as he ended up out at third base after a mix-up with Mookie Betts, but that was soon forgotten as the Dodgers' powerful offense took control.\n\nOhtani's first run came in the bottom of the third inning after first baseman Freddie Freeman swatted a 409-foot homer to centerfield.\n\n\"Ohtani is a beast, he has a mindset,\" Dodgers fan Jesus Briceno told AFP. \"He's ready to play.\"",

        "title": "Communist Nicaragua Sentences Christian Pastors to 12-15 Years in Prison on Holy Week",
        "body": "The communist regime in Nicaragua announced the conviction of 11 pastors associated with the Evangelical Mountain Gateway ministry and humanitarian organization, this week on dubious and unspecified charges of \"money laundering,\" sentencing the accused to between 12 and 15 years in prison.\n\nNicaragua - led by the radical Marxist Sandinista regime of Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo - officially convicted the pastors on March 19, but handed down the sentences on Wednesday. Two of those arrested, pastors Walner Omier Bland\u00f3n Ochoa and wife Marisela de F\u00e1tima Mej\u00eda Ruiz, received 15-year sentences. The other ten - Marcos Sergio Hern\u00e1ndez Jir\u00f3n, Harry Lening Rios Bravo, Manuel de Jes\u00fas R\u00edos Flores, Jos\u00e9 Luis Orozco Urrutia, \u00c1lvaro Daniel Escobar Caldera, Juan Carlos Chavarr\u00eda Zapata, Juan Luis Moncada, Orvin Alexis Moncada Castellano, and C\u00e9sar Facundo Burgalin Miranda - received 12-year sentences. All faced charges of \"aggravated money laundering.\"\n\nIn addition, according to the Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa, the court imposed a fine of $80 million per pastor arrested - nearly a billion dollars in fines - and two attorneys attempting to aid in the defense of the Christians, Isabel Cristina Acevedo Sol\u00eds and Maricarmen Espinoza Segura, were sentenced to ten years in prison and similarly fined tens of millions of dollars.\n\nBoth Mountain Gateway and ADF International, a faith-based legal advocacy organization, denounced the entire case as a \"sham.\" ADF International is helping Mountain Gateway appeal the case and presented the case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights seeking measures to protect the prisoners of conscience.\n\n\"ADF International has asked the Commission to demand that Nicaragua ensure the right to health, life, and physical integrity of the pastors during their stay in prison, while the proceedings are ongoing,\" the group said in a press release on Wednesday.\n\n\"In addition to being barred from meeting with their legal representation or their families, the lawyers on the case were denied access to case files and other relevant documentation against the pastors,\" the organization denounced. \"During the sham trial, the government was unable to produce any evidence of the alleged illicit activity or where the alleged unlawful funds that were 'laundered' originated.\"\n\nThe incident is the latest in a campaign of brutal and often violent repression of Christians in the majority-Christian country, timed to coincide with Holy Week in the non-Orthodox Christian world, a period during which Christians observe the crucifixion of Jesus and celebrate his resurrection.\n\nThe Sandinista regime has previously timed its acts of repression against the Christian faith to align with Christian holidays; the regime abruptly seized Mountain Gateway's assets and arrested the pastors involved shortly before Christmas. Also in late December, Sandinista authorities arrested Catholic Bishop Isidoro Mora, as he had presided over a Mass during which those congregated prayed for imprisoned and persecuted members of the Catholic clergy.\n\nThe Sandinistas have also deployed police officers to silence Christians attempting to participate in traditional religious events such as the celebration in December of the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\n\nThe repression has not been limited to churches and faith organizations. Ortega has shut down more than 3,500 nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations since 2018, when mass anti-communist protests in the country, in part fueled by Christian teachings, erupted. The Ortega-Murillo regime killed more than 300 people in 2018 in response to the peaceful movement against their ideology.\n\nMountain Gateway is an organization founded by American Pastor Jon Britton Hancock that initially worked almost exclusively to offer humanitarian aid to Nicaraguans after natural disasters and advice and support to farmers in remote parts of the country. Last year, Hancock began organizing mass evangelizing events for prayer, reflection, and community, attracting as many as 200,000 people at a time.\n\n\"We saw a massive move of God involving hundreds of thousands of people. That has been a tremendous influence in the hearts of the people of Nicaragua,\" Hancock told Breitbart News in February.\n\nMountain Gateway had announced plans for at least 13 evangelizing campaign events in the country in 2024, receiving no negative feedback from the government or any indication that it would face resistance. Before it could plan the events, however, their local pastors were arrested, accused of \"money laundering\" and \"organized crime,\" and the Sandinistas levied criminal charges against Hancock and two other Americans, son Jacob Britton Hancock and daughter-in-law Cassandra Mae Hancock, on unspecified charges.\n\n\"I do think that the size of the Gospel Campaigns and the amount of people they drew could be seen as threatening to the government,\" Hancock told Breitbart News. \"Again, I'm not sure why they are targeting us after we have worked to maintain a respectful relationship and abide by their policies and laws.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Hancock issued a statement reiterating the organization's faith and confirming Mountain Gateway would continue its campaign to defend its pastors.\n\n\"While we are certainly dismayed at the formal conviction of our colleagues and friends in Nicaragua, we remain steadfast in our hope that God is in control,\" Hancock said. \"We will do everything in our power to secure justice for friends in Nicaragua, and we ask you to join us in praying for their safety and swift release.\"",

        "title": "Cleveland Institute of Music sees $22M Kulas Hall renovation as vote of confidence by donors amid faculty turmoil",
        "body": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Cleveland Institute of Music has been having a rough time in the media. It has taken hits for years in coverage of accreditation issues, turmoil in its orchestral program, staff turnover and a recent faculty vote of no confidence against Paul Hogle, president of the elite music conservatory since 2016.\n\nOn Thursday, however, CIM pushed back against the downbeat narratives with a story of physical renewal. It unveiled architectural plans for a long-needed gut renovation of Kulas Hall, the school's outdated and acoustically deficient main rehearsal, performance and teaching space.\n\nDesigned by Cleveland architect Jonathan Kurtz with Chicago-based Threshold Acoustics, the renovation will turn a bright, complicated, visually noisy 1960s interior into a simpler, darker and more elegant space that focuses the eye and the ear on what's happening on stage.\n\nThe goal is to create a better experience for students, performers and listeners and to raise Kulas to levels of quality embodied by new or renovated auditoriums at conservatories competing with CIM for the most gifted students. A parallel objective is to rival the acoustics in Mixon Hall, CIM's recital stage, built in 2007 during an earlier architectural expansion.\n\nContext for a project\n\nAs good as it looks on paper, the Kulas project, which is scheduled to start in May and be finished by fall 2025, can't be viewed discretely as something entirely separate from the controversies that have dogged CIM. Hogle certainly isn't looking at the project that way.\n\nTo the contrary, in an interview with cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer before Thursday's announcement, CIM's president said he views the work on Kulas -- and the money backing it -- as a vote of confidence in the school's current direction and by implication his leadership, expressed in bankable gifts. CIM has raised $17 million of the $22 million cost of the renovation.\n\n\"The donors are voting with their most cherished asset, and that is their earnings,\" he said. He also strove to depersonalize the tensions at CIM by saying that he welcomed what he called passionate interest in the school and its future.\n\n\"It's not about me or any one faculty member, it's about the students, their successors and their careers,\" he said.\n\nIn a news release, the school said it has received a dozen gifts or promised gifts of $1 million or more, including $5 million from Kevin and Kristen Stein and their family, the largest single donation from a couple in CIM history.\n\nThe release also said CIM has raised $33 million toward the $40 million goal of its current Second Century Campaign through recent \"gifts, pledges, and expressed intentions.\"\n\nThe unveiling of plans for Kulas follows tensions dating back to 2015, when the Chicago-based Higher Learning Commission, one of six regional accreditation agencies, said CIM was at risk of losing its accreditation.\n\nHogle arrived a year later, after having spent six years as executive vice president of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. The Detroit Free Press described him as a key architect of the ensemble's resurrection after a debilitating 26-week strike.\n\nIn Cleveland, Hogle led CIM to a successful accreditation review in 2018. Change has continued. Hogle has pursued a downsizing, or right-sizing, of enrollment from 440 to 350 students, plus new faculty appointments, including the 2021 hiring of Carlos Kalmar as director of orchestral studies and conducting.\n\nStrife followed. In May 2023, the veteran music critic Anne Midgette, who wrote for The New York Times and The Washington Post, withdrew as keynote speaker for the CIM commencement, citing concerns over the administration's response to allegations of sexual harassment by the conductor.\n\nIn February, Kalmar filed a lawsuit against CIM alleging it had defamed him in its investigation of the harassment claims, which cleared him of wrongdoing. He's seeking $25 million.\n\nEarlier this month, a portion of CIM's faculty issued an 83-to-8 no confidence vote against Hogle and 81-10 against Provost Scott Harrison. (The school said it has an academic staff of 163, indicating a 56% participation in the vote).\n\nHogle declined to comment on the Kalmar lawsuit because it is under litigation. But he and Bonnie Cook, a CIM alumna and secretary of the school's board of directors, framed the Kulas renovation as the centerpiece of a physical and pedagogical renewal, strongly supported by the school's trustees and donors.\n\n\"The vote of no confidence [by the faculty] is based on disinformation,\" Cook said in her interview. \"We've got a small group of people that seem to be just not able to join in some of the things we've done thus far, as we've worked to improve the school.\"\n\nWhether such statements convince critics that CIM is headed in the right direction is an open question. A story about architectural improvements at the conservatory is not the place to adjudicate conflicts over music education.\n\nArchitectural heart transplant\n\nWhat's clear is that CIM's leadership sees the Kulas project as an educational heart transplant, in a physical sense, but perhaps also as a metaphorical step toward healing a hurting institution.\n\nFrom an external perspective, the Kulas renovation is an important investment in the city's cultural infrastructure. The hall attracts more than 20,000 visitors a year for more than 100 free performances and recitals and for ticketed events, such as concerts by Apollo's Fire, Cleveland's baroque orchestra. Kulas is part of the city's civic realm.\n\nFlanked by classrooms, offices and stairwells, Kulas occupies the core of CIM's main building, built in 1961, a structure designed by the Cleveland architecture firm founded by Abram Garfield, the youngest son of President James Garfield.\n\n(Before launching his own firm in 2016, Kurtz, the renovation designer, worked for an incarnation of the onetime Garfield firm before it became the Cleveland office of the national firm of DLR Group.)\n\nThe exterior of the three-story CIM building, located at 11021 East Blvd., is framed by distinctive rib-like columns of steel-reinforced concrete that stand outside a fa\u00e7ade of glass and turquoise metal panels. It's a striking example of mid-century modern architecture and a vivid reminder of the country's space-age optimism before the Vietnam War and the social upheavals of the later 1960s and 70s.\n\nKulas Hall is enclosed inside the CIM building by corridors, classrooms, offices and stairwells. The interior of the 535-seat space reflects the acoustic ideas of its time in a way that suggests spaghetti being thrown at a wall.\n\nThe stage is backed by elongated, diamond-shaped panels of wood meant to break up sound and prevent singular reflections and echoes. The side walls have angled facades perforated with rows of small vertical battens and slits concealing sound absorbing panels of mineral fiber inside. The back wall has another arrangement of elongated diamond shapes to break up sound. Overhead is a suspended plaster ceiling that undulates in a wave pattern.\n\nThe result of all this is that CIM has been struggling with acoustic difficulties for decades, including weird reflections that create stripe patterns in computer-generated diagrams of sound waves traveling through the space.\n\nCook, CIM's board secretary, recalls during her student years as a violin and voice student that it was difficult to hear herself and other players during rehearsals.\n\n\"It made me want to lean into it and play harder because I'm trying to hear myself, the person next to me, the section,\" she said. \"You end up adding to the problem.\"\n\nKurtz and designers Christopher Springthorpe and Dawn Schuette from Chicago-based Threshold Acoustics have prescribed a complete gutting. They're tearing out everything back to the underlying structure and re-routing all the ductwork above the wavy ceiling to increase the total volume of the space by a third -- one of the major sources of sonic improvement in the space.\n\nAll seating will be replaced and reduced to 460 positions. New doorways and a level cross-aisle will be created to help meet standards for ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act. Local amplifiers will be provided to hearing impaired audience members, enabling them to tune in through hearing aids to a room mic.\n\nThe Kurtz/Threshold design simplifies the hall's geometry by eliminating the folds and odd-shaped projections that now characterize the space. The goal is to eliminate the oddball sound reflections and improve resonance. Wood reflectors suspended from the ceiling and a six-paneled shell on stage will be easily adjustable.\n\nKurtz has chosen a rich palette of materials for the interior, including dark panels of chocolate-hued bog oak, so named because it has been buried for hundreds of years in a peat bog. Other panels will be made with wood-and-resin terrazzo, echoing CIM's beautiful and durable terrazzo floors. Seats will have turquoise cushions, echoing the glazed turquoise bricks in hallways around Kulas. Vertical strips of bronze will add highlights recalling brass instruments on stage.\n\nThe design awaits construction, testing and adjustments to the movable parts before students arrive for their first classes on stage. If all goes well when it's finished students will be able to hear each other better than their predecessors ever did.",

        "body": "Biden OKs $60M in aid after Baltimore bridge collapse as governor warns of 'very long road ahead'\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore warned Thursday of a \"very long road ahead\" to recover from the loss of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge as the Biden administration approved $60 million in immediate federal aid after the deadly collapse.\n\nMassive barges carrying cranes streamed toward the site to begin the challenging work of removing twisted metal and concrete as a first step toward reopening a key shipping route blocked by the wreckage of the span.\n\nMoore promised that \"the best minds in the world\" were working on plans to clear the debris, move the cargo ship that rammed into the bridge from the channel, recover the bodies of the four remaining workers presumed dead and investigate what went wrong.\n\n\"Government is working hand in hand with industry to investigate the area, including the wreck, and remove the ship,\" said Moore, a Democrat, who said quick aid is needed to \"lay the foundation for a rapid recovery.\" President Joe Biden has pledged the federal government would pay the full cost of rebuilding the bridge.\n\n\"This work is not going to take hours. This work is not going to take days. This work is not going to take weeks,\" Moore said. \"We have a very long road ahead of us.\"\n\nWhy did more than 1,000 people die after police subdued them with force that isn't meant to kill?\n\nCarl Grant, a Vietnam veteran with dementia, wandered out of a hospital room to charge a cellphone he imagined he had. When he wouldn't sit still, the police officer escorting Grant body-slammed him, ricocheting the patient's head off the floor.\n\nTaylor Ware, a former Marine and aspiring college student, walked the grassy grounds of an interstate rest stop trying to shake the voices in his head. After Ware ran from an officer, he was attacked by a police dog, jolted by a stun gun, pinned on the ground and injected with a sedative.\n\nAnd Donald Ivy Jr., a former three-sport athlete, left an ATM alone one night when officers sized him up as suspicious and tried to detain him. Ivy took off, and police tackled and shocked him with a stun gun, belted him with batons and held him facedown.\n\nEach man was unarmed. Each was not a threat to public safety. And despite that, each died after police used a kind of force that is not supposed to be deadly -- and can be much easier to hide than the blast of an officer's gun.\n\nEvery day, police rely on common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop people without killing them, such as physical holds, Tasers and body blows. But when misused, these tactics can still end in death -- as happened with George Floyd in 2020, sparking a national reckoning over policing. And while that encounter was caught on video, capturing Floyd's last words of \"I can't breathe,\" many others throughout the United States have escaped notice.\n\nUN top court orders Israel to open more land crossings for aid into Gaza\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The top United Nations court on Thursday ordered Israel to take measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including opening more land crossings to allow food, water, fuel and other supplies into the war-ravaged enclave.\n\nThe International Court of Justice issued two new so-called provisional measures in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its military campaign launched after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Israel denies it is committing genocide. It says its military campaign is self defense and aimed at Hamas, not the Palestinian people.\n\nThursday's order came after South Africa sought more provisional measures, including a cease-fire, citing starvation in Gaza. Israel urged the court not to issue new orders.\n\nIn its legally binding order, the court told Israel to take measures \"without delay\" to ensure \"the unhindered provision\" of basic services and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies.\n\nIt also ordered Israel to immediately ensure that its military does not take action that could that could harm Palestinians' rights under the Genocide Convention, including by preventing the delivery of humanitarian assistance.\n\nDoctors visiting a Gaza hospital are stunned by the war's toll on Palestinian children\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza (AP) -- An international team of doctors visiting a hospital in central Gaza was prepared for the worst. But the gruesome impact Israel's war against Hamas is having on Palestinian children still left them stunned.\n\nOne toddler died from a brain injury caused by an Israeli strike that fractured his skull. His cousin, an infant, is still fighting for her life with part of her face blown off by the same strike.\n\nAn unrelated 10-year-old boy screamed out in pain for his parents, not knowing that they were killed in the strike. Beside him was his sister, but he didn't recognize her because burns covered almost her entire body.\n\nThese gut-wrenching casualties were described to The Associated Press by Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive-care doctor from Jordan, following a 10-hour overnight shift at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah.\n\nHaj-Hassan, who has extensive experience in Gaza and regularly speaks out about the war's devastating effects, was part of a team that recently finished a two-week stint there.\n\nFallen crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for a massive fraud on hundreds of thousands of customers that unraveled with the collapse of FTX, once one of the world's most popular platforms for exchanging digital currency.\n\nThough he described Bankman-Fried as \"extremely smart,\" U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan delivered a blistering analysis of Bankman-Fried and his crimes before announcing a sentence that was half of what prosecutors sought and less than a quarter of the 105 years recommended by the court's probation officers.\n\n\"There is absolutely no doubt that Mr. Bankman-Fried's name right now is pretty much mud around the world,\" Kaplan said of the 32-year-old California man who seemed atop the cryptocurrency universe before his businesses collapsed in November 2022, leaving customers, investors and lenders short over $11 billion, which the judge ordered him to forfeit.\n\nHe was convicted in November of fraud and conspiracy -- a dramatic fall from a crest of success that included a Super Bowl advertisement, testimony before Congress and celebrity endorsements from stars like quarterback Tom Brady, basketball point guard Stephen Curry and comedian Larry David.\n\nKaplan imposed the sentence in the same Manhattan courtroom where, four months previously, Bankman-Fried testified that he had intended to revolutionize the emerging cryptocurrency market with his innovative and altruistic ideas, not steal.\n\nTrump attends wake of slain New York officer, calls for 'law and order,' to show contrast with Biden\n\nMASSAPEQUA PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Donald Trump attended Thursday's wake of a New York City police officer gunned down in the line of duty and called for \"law and order,\" as part of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's attempt to show a contrast with President Joe Biden and focus on crime as part of his third White House campaign.\n\nThe visitation for Officer Jonathan Diller, who was fatally shot during a traffic stop on Monday, was held in suburban Massapequa on Long Island. Police said the 31-year-old Diller was shot below his bulletproof vest while approaching an illegally parked car in Queens.\n\nDiller, who was married and had a 1-year-old son, was rushed to a hospital, where he died.\n\nTrump's visit came as Biden was also in New York for a previously scheduled fundraiser with Democratic ex-presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Trump has accused Biden of lacking toughness and his campaign sought to contrast his visit with Biden's fundraiser.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, noted Trump's visit and said, \"Meanwhile, the Three Stooges -- Biden, Obama, and Clinton -- will be at a glitzy fundraiser in the city with their elitist, out-of-touch celebrity benefactors.\"\n\nBiden's fundraiser with Obama and Clinton nets a record $25 million, his campaign says\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A fundraiser for President Joe Biden on Thursday in New York City that also stars Barack Obama and Bill Clinton is raising a whopping $25 million, setting a record for the biggest haul for a political event, his campaign said.\n\nThe eye-popping amount was a major show of Democratic support for Biden at a time of persistently low poll numbers. The president will test the power of the campaign cash as he faces off with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has already proved with his 2016 win over Democrat Hillary Clinton that he didn't need to raise the most money to seize the presidency.\n\nThe Radio City Music Hall event will be a gilded exclamation mark on a recent burst of presidential campaign travel. Biden has visited several political battlegrounds in the three weeks since his State of the Union address served as a rallying cry for his reelection bid. The event also brings together more than three decades of Democratic leadership.\n\nObama hitched a ride from Washington to New York aboard Air Force One with Biden. They waved as they descended the plane's steps at John F. Kennedy International Airport and got into the motorcade for the ride into Manhattan. Clinton was expected to meet them at the event.\n\nThe hourslong fundraiser has different tiers of access depending on donors' generosity. The centerpiece is an onstage conversation with the three presidents, moderated by late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert. There's also a lineup of musical performers -- Queen Latifah, Lizzo, Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo and Lea Michele -- that will be hosted by actress Mindy Kaling. Thousands are expected, and tickets are as low as $225.\n\nBlack pastors see popular Easter services as an opportunity to rebuild in-person worship attendance\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many churches moved their services online, the Rev. William H. Lamar IV initially shuddered at the thought that he needed to morph into a \"video personality\" to stay engaged with his parishioners.\n\n\"I resisted kicking and screaming because I'm a child of the '70s,\" said Lamar, the senior pastor of historic Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. \"I'm not a digital native.\"\n\nFour years later, Lamar, a talented preacher, has adjusted to offering both virtual and in-person services. After a noticeable attendance drop, more Metropolitan congregants are choosing in-person worship over virtual, even as they mourn members who died from COVID-19.\n\nThis Easter, Lamar is grateful to be back in person with his flock, believing it's a fitting way to celebrate the holiday's message of hope and resurrection.\n\nThis Easter is also an opportunity for Black churches to welcome more visitors to their pews and try to begin reversing attendance trends. More than a dozen Black clergy said their churches are still feeling the pandemic's impact on already-waning attendance, even as they have rolled out robust online options to reach new people.\n\nHouse Republicans invite President Biden to testify at public hearing as impeachment inquiry stalls\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans on Thursday invited President Joe Biden to testify before Congress in what appears to be a last-ditch effort to deliver on their stalled monthslong impeachment inquiry into the Biden family businesses.\n\nRep. James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to the Democratic president, inviting him to sit for a public hearing to \"explain, under oath,\" what involvement he had in the Biden family businesses. So far, the GOP-led inquiry has not produced hard evidence of wrongdoing while Biden was in public office.\n\n\"In light of the yawning gap between your public statements and the evidence assembled by the Committee, as well as the White House's obstruction, it is in the best interest of the American people for you to answer questions from Members of Congress directly, and I hereby invite you to do so,\" the Kentucky Republican wrote.\n\nWhile it is highly unlikely that Biden would agree to appear before lawmakers in such a setting, Comer pointed to previous examples of presidents' testifying before Congress.\n\n\"As you are aware, presidents before you have provided testimony to congressional committees, including President Ford's testimony before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974,\" Comer continued.\n\nTrump's team cites First Amendment in contesting charges in Georgia election interference case\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- The charges against Donald Trump in the Georgia election interference case seek to criminalize political speech and advocacy conduct that the First Amendment protects, a lawyer for the former president said Thursday as he argued that the indictment should be dismissed.\n\nThe hearing before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee was on a filing from Trump and on two pretrial motions by co-defendant David Shafer and centered on technical legal arguments. It marked something of a return to normalcy after the case was rocked by allegations that District Attorney Fani Willis improperly benefited from her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor hired for the case.\n\n\"There is nothing alleged factually against President Trump that is not political speech,\" Trump's lead lawyer, Steve Sadow, told the judge. Sadow said a sitting president expressing concerns about an election is \"the height of political speech\" and that is protected even if what was said ended up being false.\n\nProsecutor Donald Wakeford countered that Trump's statements are not protected by the First Amendment because they were integral to criminal activity.\n\n\"It's not just that they were false. It's not that the defendant has been hauled into a courtroom because the prosecution doesn't like what he said,\" Wakeford said, adding that Trump is free to express his opinion and make legitimate protests. \"What he is not allowed to do is to employ his speech and his expression and his statements as part of a criminal conspiracy to violate Georgia's RICO statute, to impersonate public officers, to file false documents, to make false statements to the government.\"",

        "title": "This Easter, Is Christianity Still Promulgating Antisemitism?",
        "body": "This Sunday, Christians around the world will celebrate the peace and renewal promised by Easter, but at the heart of Holy Week liturgies leading up to the feast are a set of texts that have had brutal consequences for Jews, not just in the past, but in the present. The Gospel narratives of the passion and death of Jesus have, across centuries, framed how Jews are perceived. The response to the tragic events now unfolding in Gaza and Israel requires a fresh look at this unresolved and expressly Christian quandary. The lesson may be familiar, but it has urgent relevance.\n\nAn unfathomed thermal current long running below the surface of a broad culture -- call it the culture of \"the West\" -- is still being tapped, even if unconsciously. That current was first generated roughly two thousand years ago, in the way that early followers of Jesus told the story of the Crucifixion, as a crime laid at the feet of the Jews. After the Holocaust made plain that the \"Christ-killer\" slander was part of what prepared the way for the mass murder of Jews, the trope was repudiated by the Second Vatican Council, in the 1965 declaration Nostra Aetate. \"What happened in His passion,\" the fathers of the Roman Catholic council said, \"cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today.\"\n\nBut there was a problem. The Gospels themselves explicitly lodge the Christ-killer charge: for example, in Matthew, which is often read at Mass on Palm Sunday, Pontius Pilate pronounces Jesus not guilty and makes an offer to release him, but an assembled crowd of Jews cries, \"Let him be crucified.\" Pilate then famously washes his hands, saying, \"I am innocent of the blood of this just person.\" At which point, the crowd replies, let \"his blood be on us, and on our children.\" And so it has been.\n\nDespite Nostra Aetate, neither the council fathers nor their successors put in place an effective educational structure that would enable people to understand that the narrative was most likely written not by eyewitnesses but by followers of Jesus in the late first century. Those second-generation Christians may not have known that Pilate was a brutal tyrant, or that any benign portrayal of him as being friendly toward a troublemaking nobody was surely false. The antagonism between the remembered Jesus and \"the Jews\" was one of which the actual Jesus would have known nothing. Though he participated in disputations that were normal in the Jewish community of his time -- such as debates over what exactly the Shabbat laws required, or what deference was due to Caesar -- he was in mortal conflict not with his own people but with the Roman government.\n\nSo how did this story come to be written? Jesus died in about 30 A.D. In the year 70, the Romans destroyed the second iteration of the Jerusalem Temple, which had anchored the faith of Judaism for hundreds of years. This act sparked an intense religious crisis: What was it to be a Jew without the Temple? For most, the answer lay in studying the Torah and, generally, the Hebrew Scriptures, and in the observance of halacha, or religious laws, including those governing Shabbat and the kosher diet. For some others, Jesus was becoming the new Temple, a transfiguration embodied in a prediction that the Gospel of John attributes to Jesus, referring to his own coming resurrection: \"Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\" The Jewish-Roman War, which continued intermittently for decades, fuelled this intra-Jewish dispute -- a familiar phenomenon, in which imperial overlords contrive to set subject peoples against themselves -- and the Gospels, written in the decades after the Temple's destruction, are a record of one side of that dispute. The phrase \"the Jews\" (in the Greek, \"hoi Ioudaioi\") appears more than a hundred and forty times in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, which follows them in the New Testament, and the name usually signifies the many Jews who disagreed with those Jews who saw Jesus as the Messiah; the latter were fewer in number, but their version of the story is what survived.\n\nBut the Christ-killer charge is not the largest problem. Inspired by the anti-Jewish slant in some passages of the Gospels, many Christians have tended to remember Jesus -- or, rather, misremember him -- as if he were not a Jew at all. To portray Jesus as merciful and large-hearted, the Gospels render Jews more broadly as law-obsessed and unloving: in Luke, for example, Jews refuse to help a wounded traveller waylaid by a robber, leaving his rescue to the Samaritan. Gospel Jews are the foil against which the Gospel Jesus can dazzle as flawless. The Pharisees, a Jewish sect committed to religious laws, are painted so darkly in the role of Jesus's antagonists that their name comes down to us as a synonym for hypocrites, not because that was so but because they were the forerunners of \"the Jews\" with whom the post-Temple Christians were in tension. In these ways, the \"Gospel truth\" boils down to a conflict of Jesus against the Jews. The first chapter of John declares, \"He came unto his own, and his own received him not.\" Not so. The only people who received Jesus in his lifetime -- his apostles and disciples -- were his own; they were Jewish.\n\nGradually, across the many years in which the Gospels took shape, Jesus came to be regarded as divine: he is depicted in John as saying, \"I and my Father are one.\" That made the purported crime of the Jews even worse, since the murder of God -- deicide -- is a cosmic transgression that's impossible to adjudicate, much less forgive. And belief in the divinity of Jesus further undercut his followers' ability to see him as a Jew. Judaism, after all, is a religion -- a form of mediation between finite humans and the infinite God. Once Jesus was conceived of in a permanent mystical union with the Godhead, he no longer had any need of a go-between. He had no need, that is, of Temple sacrifice, Torah study, Shabbat observance, praying the Psalms. In following such practices, he would just have been going through the motions. A divine Jesus would have been, in essence, a pretend Jew.\n\nThe Roman war culminated in a large-scale Jewish uprising in Judea that was ultimately crushed in the year 136, a catastrophe that precipitated the demise of the Jewish center of Jesus's movement. Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, gentile Christians -- originally from a variety of polytheistic, pagan, and local religious traditions -- began to dominate the nascent Church, and their reading of texts that emphasized Jesus's conflict with \"the Jews\" would have led them naturally to remember him as if he, too, were a gentile. That fantasy took hold in the Christian imagination. (Images of Jesus typically depict him with white European features and long-flowing brown hair.) \"Jesus against the Jews\" is Christianity's paradigmatic origin story, forming, in effect, a spoiled gene in the DNA of the Church. Because Christianity was the incubator of Western civilization, that gene was passed on. That origin story gave Christians and a Christianity-influenced culture a litany of oppositions: the Church against the Synagogue, the New Testament against the Old Testament, grace against law, faith against works, Easter against Passover, Sunday against Saturday, Portia against Shylock -- and always, the Christian God of Love against the Jewish God of Vengeance.",

        "body": "Dr Andareas Peter\n\n\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" - John 3:16\n\nGood Friday, a significant event in the Christian calendar, occurs on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday and is observed during Holy Week. It serves as a time of deep reflection and solemnity, marking the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Christians worldwide commemorate this day with reverence, contemplating the profound sacrifice made by Jesus for the redemption of humanity. Across the globe, churches hold special services and processions to honour the events of Good Friday, emphasizing themes of repentance, forgiveness, and salvation.\n\nWhen we say it is a Good Friday, people generally think that the day is about celebrating a cause of happiness. Unlike what the term implies, Good Friday is a day that Christians all over the world spend in sorrow. Good Friday is the day when people mourn the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Since it is the most significant and holiest day for Christians, people spend this day praying for the forgiveness of their sins. Good Friday is observed two days before Easter, which celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christians prepare themselves for 40 days by taking Lent before they enter the Holy Week, where they observe Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter.According to the religion of Christianity, people believe that the Almighty God had sent His only son, Jesus Christ, to save people from their sins and guide them on the righteous path. Jesus was born in this world as the son of Joseph and Mary and lived here as a man. Throughout his life, Jesus has been preaching about love and forgiveness and performed several miracles to make people believe in God and eternal life.\n\nThough Jesus continued to teach, some people did not consider him to be sent by God and hence started protesting against him. He was imprisoned and subjected to cruel punishments, which included intense beating with sharp weapons and carrying the heavy cross for long miles. It was after all this thrashing that he was nailed to the cross and put up to be ridiculed by others. The Good Friday emphasises that Jesus sacrificed himself to pay for the sins of humankind. Since this act is considered a win of good against evil, this day is called Good Friday, even though people lament the death of Jesus.\n\nThe historical roots of Good Friday trace back to the biblical accounts found in the New Testament. According to Christian belief, Jesus Christ was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by crucifixion by the Roman authorities in Jerusalem.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus represents a pivotal moment in Christian theology, symbolizing the atonement for human sins and the ultimate act of love and sacrifice. Christians regard Good Friday as a profound expression of God's mercy and grace towards humanity, as Jesus willingly endured suffering and death to offer redemption and eternal life. The significance of Good Friday extends beyond historical events; it holds deep spiritual meaning for Christians worldwide. It is a day of solemn reflection and contemplation, prompting believers to meditate on the profound love and forgiveness demonstrated through Christ's death on the cross. Good Friday serves as a reminder of the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in the Christian faith, emphasizing themes of redemption, reconciliation, and spiritual renewal. Through prayer, meditation, and worship, Christians seek to deepen their understanding of Christ's sacrifice and its implications for their lives.\n\nThroughout history, various traditions and observances have emerged around Good Friday, reflecting the diverse cultural and religious practices of Christian communities worldwide. Church services play a central role in Good Friday observances, featuring solemn liturgies, scripture readings, prayers, hymns, and reflections on the Passion narrative. Many churches also incorporate the Stations of the Cross, a series of devotions depicting Jesus' journey to the cross, into their Good Friday services.\n\nFasting and abstinence are common practices among Christians on Good Friday, symbolizing a spirit of penance, self-discipline, and solidarity with Christ's suffering. Believers abstain from meat and other luxuries as a form of spiritual discipline, seeking to emulate Jesus' sacrifice and draw closer to God through self-denial. Some Christians observe a strict fast throughout the day, while others may partake in one meal of bread and water or engage in partial fasting. Processions and rituals are also prevalent in many Christian communities on Good Friday. Some churches organize outdoor processions, re-enacting Jesus' journey to the cross, while others conduct indoor ceremonies that involve the veneration of the cross.\n\nThe veneration of the cross is a solemn ritual in which believers approach and kiss or touch a crucifix, symbolizing reverence for Christ's sacrifice and their commitment to following him. Good Friday is marked by a sense of quiet contemplation and reverence, with believers spending time in prayer, meditation, and reflection on the events of Jesus' crucifixion. It is a day to express gratitude for God's mercy and grace, acknowledging the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in bringing salvation and eternal life to humanity. As Christians observe Good Friday, they are reminded of the hope and redemption found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is celebrated joyously on Easter Sunday. It is a time for Christians to come together to pray, reflect, and remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. In addition to the traditional religious observances, many Christians also use Good Friday as a time to perform acts of charity and service to others. This is because the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is seen as a model of selflessness and love for others, and so Good Friday is an opportunity for Christians to follow in his footsteps. Overall, Good Friday is a solemn and meaningful day for Christians around the world. It is a time to remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, to reflect on the importance of selflessness and love for others, and to renew one's faith and commitment to Christian principles.",

        "body": "Why is Good Friday called Good Friday, and why are bunnies associated with Easter?\n\nThe name \"Good Friday\" seems a little bit misleading, considering it is the day that Jesus was crucified on the cross.\n\nGood Friday marks the first of the three holy days of Easter, symbolising the central message of the Christian faith - the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nREAD MORE: Freddie Flintoff's TV return confirmed after horror Top Gear crash\n\nREAD MORE: Camilla makes history as Charles absent due to cancer treatment\n\nGood Friday is the day Jesus was condemned to death and crucified on the cross by the Romans for being a perceived threat to authority.\n\nOn this day, Christians thank him for his sacrifice by taking the day to reflect, be silent, and fast.\n\nThe 15th hour of the day is widely considered to be the time he died, and so many liturgies are performed in churches at this time. He was then buried in a tomb the next day.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nThe day after that, on what we now know as the third day of Easter, the tomb Christ was buried in was found empty.\n\nIt was first believed the body had been stolen, despite constant guard presence - at least until Jesus appeared in front of his disciples, having overcome death.\n\nHe then ascended to Heaven, taking his place on the right hand of God, according to the Apostles' Creed.\n\nWhy is it called 'Good Friday'?\n\nThere are many theories as to why the holy day is known as \"Good\" Friday.\n\nFor instance, many believed that \"Good\" was an alternate spelling of \"God\", just as our modern word \"Goodbye\" came from the phrase \"God be with ye\".\n\nBut this theory has been largely debunked.\n\nREAD MORE: Charles hosts private audiences after skipping annual tradition\n\nREAD MORE: Star wasn't allowed to film without 'gruelling' 12-week program\n\n\"The origin from God is out of the question\" Professor Anatoly Liberman from the University of Minnesota told Slate.\n\nLinguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer seconded this, also telling Slate, \"None of the early examples in the Oxford English Dictionary imply that it started off as God's rather than Good, so I don't really see this as more than speculative etymology.\"\n\nIt's important to know that Good Friday isn't known as \"Good\" everywhere.\n\nThere are different names for it all around the world. There is a largely held misconception that the German phrase for the holiday is \"Gottes Freitag\", translating to \"God's Friday\", when it is actually Karfreitag, or \"Sorrowful Friday\".\n\nIn Russian, the phrase translates to \"Passion Friday\", whereas for the Romance languages, the word translates to \"Sacred Friday\".\n\n\"The answer seems pretty clearly to be that it's from good 'holy',\" said Jesse Sheidlower, the president of the American Dialect Society to Slate.\n\nREAD MORE: Charles gives first public address since Catherine's cancer announcement\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary additionally notes that there was once \"Good Wednesday\", the Wednesday before Easter, which is now more commonly known as \"Holy Wednesday\".\n\nThis helps contextualise the name of the holiday with the events that occurred on that day.\n\nDespite the rather tragic occurrence of Jesus Christ dying on the cross, without this event, there would be nothing to save his people from sin, thus making the name appropriate for the occasion, despite appearing otherwise.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic of Easter, why are bunnies associated with it?\n\nThe celebration of the pagan goddess Eostre, the goddess of fertility of humans and crops, was held during the Spring equinox, a time for rebirth and new life.\n\nThe German goddess' symbols included the rabbit (which are known as good breeders) and eggs (symbols of new life), as well as the colours green, purple, and yellow.\n\nThe tradition of the Easter bunny is believed to stem from the Eostre celebration, helped along by the arrival of German immigrants in America in the 1700s.\n\nAs Time reports, some sources believe that German immigrants brought with them their fable of an egg-laying hare called \"Osterhase\" or \"Oschter Haws\" who would deliver well-behaved children colored eggs in nests they made in their caps and bonnets before Easter.\n\nEggs eventually expanded to chocolate and other gifts, decorated baskets replaced hats, and children left out carrots for the bunny in case it got hungry from all it's hard work.\n\nThere is evidently much overlap with Easter, and many pagans believe Christians have adopted pagan traditions, aligning them with the narrative of the rebirth of Jesus Christ.",

        "body": "Good Friday is a sombre commemoration of the day Jesus Christ the saviour was crucified. He was crowned with thorns, condemned to death, carried the burden of the cross and was crucified between two thieves, according to gospel narratives. Goof Friday is observed as a day of fasting and sorrow described in the German word, karfreitag, loosely translated as mourning Friday, said Prof. Kumool Abbi.\n\nGood Friday consists of reading of the gospel, the passion narrative, adoration of the cross and holy communion. The history of salvation is commemorated: Lord Jesus Christ, through His redemptive suffering takes away the sins of the world. The assurance of the divine covenant, the certitude and promise of the love of God is rejuvenated.\n\nEaster celebrates the resurrection of Christ on the third day after his crucifixion. The earliest recorded observation of Easter comes from the second century. Venerable Bede propounded the view that Easter was derived from eostrae, the Anglo Saxon Goddess of spring and fertility. The Council of Nicaea decreed in 325 AD that Easter be observed on the first Sunday, following the first full moon, after the Spring Equinox. In 1955, the Roman Catholic Church set the time for Easter vigil at Easter mass at midnight. This vigil is characterised by a spirit of joyful anticipation of the resurrection and the second coming of Jesus Christ. In Roman Catholic tradition, the vigil has four parts: the celebration of lights focused on paschal candle, the service of light, liturgy of the word and liturgy of the Eucharist. On this day, the history of salvation is commemorated and eternal promise and hope of the salvation of the world, prevalence of faith, peace, love and harmony is renewed.\n\nRead Comments",

        "title": "Consumers Respond Accordingly After Cadbury Egg Store in the UK Goes Politically Correct for Easter",
        "body": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.\n\nWhile the most important part about Easter for believers is of course the message about Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, many of us have been known to also take part in the more consumer-driven aspects of the holiday. They include but are not limited to the purchasing of cutesy pastel-colored home and yard decor, the making of elaborate Easter baskets, volunteering for Easter egg painting and hunts, and the enjoyment of sweet treats like Peeps and chocolate bunnies (my personal preference is for the hollow version).\n\nBut as always, anytime there is a holiday that involves the Christian faith, there are the politically correct among us (both here and across) who become fauxfended at the mere thought of using words like \"Easter\" and \"Christmas\" and who then seek to take the enjoyment right out of the season by demanding everyone around them join in on their misery.\n\nREAD-->> Easter Surprise: Pennsylvania Town 'Finds' Out What to Call This Year's Egg Hunt\n\nSuch appears to have been the case for at least one Cadbury outlet store in the United Kingdom, where the term \"gesture eggs\" was substituted for \"Easter eggs\" in one of their windows, with concerns about customers taking offense over the word \"Easter\" suspected of being the rationale:\n\nThe photo was taken by Connor James Ibbetson, a journalist for the UK Telegraph. The news outlet filed the following report on the controversy:\n\nA Cadbury store has been accused of erasing Easter by advertising chocolate eggs as \"gesture eggs\".\n\nThe brand's discount store in Springfields Outlet in Spalding, Lincolnshire, is displaying signs offering customers a two-for-\u00a310 deal on \"gesture eggs\".\n\nThe omission of the word \"Easter\", particularly when advertising its popular Easter eggs synonymous with the religious holiday, has provoked anger among the Christian community.\n\n[...]\n\nCadbury said the Springfields Outlet store was run \"completely independently\" by Freshstore and denied having any involvement in the \"gesture eggs\" promotion or poster accompanying it.\n\nNeedless to say, outrage ensued, with many consumers on social media accusing Cadbury of trying to erase Easter and Christianity. This man's epic rant summed up the sentiment rather nicely:\n\nIn their denial statement, Cadbury spokespeople went on to say that not only have they used the word \"Easter\" for the past century on their packaging, but that they will continue to do so now and in the future:\n\n\"All Cadbury Easter shell eggs sold in the UK reference Easter very clearly on the packaging - sometimes multiple times.\n\nCadbury has used the word Easter in our marketing and communications for over 100 years and continue to do so with our new Easter product range. To claim anything otherwise is factually incorrect.\"\n\nThey also noted that they would soon be connecting with the location in question, which reportedly isn't commenting, to request they take the \"gesture egg\" posters down.\n\nThe BBC confirmed after a visit to the store that the promo posters had indeed been taken down.\n\nThat said, the Daily Mail discovered that several other locations in the UK also had \"gesture egg\" signage in their stores.\n\nAs the mystery about the \"gesture egg\" campaign deepens, the question remains:\n\nWhat in the heck is a \"gesture egg\" exactly? Inquiring minds want to know...",

        "body": "\"At any point, Hamas could have ended this burgeoning tragedy to\n\nsurrender and release every hostage. ...\n\nHamas instigated and owns this humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA)\n\nIsrael deployed a large-scale facial recognition tracking program in the Gaza Strip and created a database of Palestinians without their knowledge or consent, according to The Verge, citing a New York Times report. The program, which was created after the October 7 attacks, uses technology from Google Photos , as well as a custom tool designed by Tel Aviv-based Corsight to identify people affiliated with Hamas. The facial recognition program was created in conjunction with the Israeli military offensive in Gaza, according to a New York Times report.\n\nAfter the October 7 attacks, officers in the IDF's Unit 8200, the IDF's main intelligence unit, identified potential targets by watching security camera footage and videos that Hamas had uploaded to social media. The soldiers also asked the Palestinian prisoners to identify people from their communities who belong to Hamas. Corsight, which boasted that its technology could accurately identify people even if less than 50% of their faces were visible, used these images to build a facial recognition tool that Israeli officers could use in Gaza. In order to further build its database - and identify potential targets - the Israeli army set up checkpoints equipped with facial recognition cameras along the main routes Palestinians use to flee south.\n\nOne officer told the New York Times that the goal was to create a \"hit list\" of people who participated in the October 7 attack. Troopers told the New York Times that Corsight's technology was not always accurate, especially when it relied on grainy footage or images in which people's faces were obscured. In some cases, Corsight mistakenly identified people as being linked to Hamas. One such case involves the Palestinian poet Musab Abu Toha, who was picked up from an Israeli military checkpoint on the central highway in Gaza in mid-November while trying to leave Gaza for Egypt with his family. The IDF had marked Abu Toha as being on the Israeli list of wanted persons. Israeli officers held Abu Toha in a detention center, where he was beaten and interrogated for two days before being returned to Gaza without explanation.\n\nThe Israeli army has integrated Corsight's technology with Google Images - which, unlike Corsight, is free to use - the soldiers said in the newspaper's report. Intelligence officers uploaded databases of \"known persons\" to Google Images and used the image search function to further identify the people. One of the officers said in the report that Google Photos can recognize people even when only a small portion of their faces are visible, making it better than other tools, including Corsight. Corsight executives and financiers have expressed a desire to assist the Israeli military in its ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn an op-ed for The Jerusalem Post last October, Aaron Ashkenazi, founder and managing partner of Canadian fund Awz Ventures, which led a $5 million Corsight funding round in 2020, wrote that Awz was providing Israel with \"technological tools.\" To stop these terrorist attacks.\" Most of the companies in OZ's portfolio operate in the artificial intelligence and cybersecurity sectors. Last October, some hospitals in Israel began using CorSight's technology to identify patients, Forbes reported at the time.\n\nAccording to a Forbes report, Corsight's technology was able to take photos of people \"whose features have been affected by physical trauma, and find a match between photos sent by the relevant family members.\" Corsight focuses on selling its products to government, law enforcement, and military uses, according to The Verge. The company said in 2020 that its technology could recognize masked faces. Two years later, Corsight claimed to be developing a tool that could create a model of a person's face based on their DNA. Last year, Corsight worked with the Metropolitan Police in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, to track down suspects in murders and robberies on the public transportation system, according to The Verge.\n\nIsraeli N12 TV News reprted the head of the Mossad, Dedi Barnea, informed the cabinet that, despite Hamas' answer, there is a possibility of progress - but the price is flexibility regarding the return of residents to the northern Gaza Strip. Barnea explained that it is necessary and possible to think of a creative solution, and this effort is worth the chance of getting 40 hostages out alive. The position of the head of the Mossad was supported by ministers Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, along with minister Ron Dermer. In front of them, in an intermediate position, are Defense Minister Yoav Galant and Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi who claim that this is not the time to be flexible - we should advance to Rafah but not announce it publicly, in order to allow another American effort to promote negotiations and give a chance for a deal.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with an extreme position - according to him, the members of the cabinet do not know how to conduct tough negotiations. Therefore, Netanyahu did not accept the position of head of the Mossad in Barnae and ordered to prepare to enter Rafah - and to announce this publicly. Netanyahu also informed his members The cabinet because contrary to what was published - it intends to send a delegation to the White House as early as next week. A political official told News 12: \"We have to honestly tell the public - not to submit an Israeli proposal at this time, is to bury the abductees deal for a long time.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration officials are holding preliminary \"talks\" about options for stabilizing Gaza after the war, including a proposal that the Pentagon help fund a multinational force or Palestinian peacekeeping team, according to Politico magazine. The magazine reported that the options being considered will not include American forces on the ground, according to two officials from the Ministry of Defense and two other American officials, all of whom requested anonymity. Instead, Defense Department funding will go toward the needs of security forces and supplement assistance from other countries.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from the magazine, a senior US administration official said, \"We are working with partners on different scenarios for interim governance and security structures in Gaza once the crisis subsides,\" refusing to reveal details. \"We have had a number of conversations with both the Israelis and our partners about the key elements for the next day in Gaza when the time comes,\" he added.\n\nIt may be weeks or months before Washington and its partners agree to any plan, especially since regional players want to see a commitment to a two-state solution before seriously engaging in options. There are also questions about the feasibility of training a potential Palestinian-led force in time to maintain order in Gaza, which has been devastated after five months of brutal fighting. Israel is reluctant to hold these talks until it defeats Hamas militarily and secures the release of hostages held by the movement. Some officials within the Israeli government have called for Israel to occupy Gaza after the war, a proposal opposed by the United States.\n\nThe four officials confirmed to the magazine that the talks include the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department and their foreign counterparts about what a potential post-war security force would look like. Under initial plans being developed, the Defense Department would provide funding for a type of security force that would not include U.S. troops on the ground in Gaza, according to Defense Department officials.\n\nOne official added that the aid could be used for reconstruction, infrastructure, humanitarian aid and other needs. The Strip has turned into rubble, and the vast majority of its population of 2.2 million people are displaced due to difficulty accessing food, water and medicine. The Pentagon will likely need to transfer money from elsewhere in the department to pay for the plan. US aid would complement contributions from other countries, according to US officials. As for a potential Palestinian-led peacekeeping team, it remains unclear who will train and equip its members, which could include some of the approximately 20,000 security personnel supported by the Palestinian Authority.\n\nSpokesmen for the Defense Ministry and the Israeli government did not immediately respond to POLITICO's requests for comment.\n\nThe Pentagon began considering options to support some sort of multinational force to stabilize Gaza in the new year, when there were expectations that Israel might soon begin winding down its operations, according to the Defense Department official. Then in January, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israel to work with regional countries and moderate Palestinians to rebuild, stabilize and govern Gaza once the war ends. \"This can only come through a regional approach that includes a path to a Palestinian state,\" he said during a visit to Israel. Although American officials have held talks with regional partners about what the composition of such a force would look like, none of them have confirmed participation. Because the plan has not been finalized.\n\nSeveral countries in the Middle East have told the Biden administration that they will only consider participating when there is a serious plan for a two-state solution. \"Although we had conversations on the sidelines with regional partners about what they would be willing to do, contribute to, and accept, this did not receive serious attention from our Israeli partner,\" the official said. The official added that Israel \"does not set a date for the end of its operations because it has not yet achieved the goals it seeks\" in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department is focused on increasing the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza, including ensuring the security of the US military's plan to build a pier to deliver resources by sea to the Strip, and urging Israel to consider \"alternatives\" to invading Rafah,\" the Defense Department official said. The official added that what comes after the talks also includes the possibility of a two-state solution.\n\nThe Telegraph newspaper quoted an Israeli intelligence source as saying that Tel Aviv believed in the possibility of eliminating the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) due to Washington's support, but this has changed now. He added that the Israeli army believes that some of Hamas's underground weapons production facilities in Gaza are still intact. He stated that the failure of the Israeli army to enter Rafah in force means that Hamas' survival is the most likely possibility, as he put it.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted sources in the Israeli army as saying that there are currently no indications that the army will be able to rescue more prisoners, or kill more Hamas leaders. The sources added that Hamas can still easily return to the areas that the army had previously controlled, in the absence of a stable plan for managing Gaza after the war. Since last October 7, the Israeli army has been waging a devastating war on Gaza that has left tens of thousands of martyrs and wounded, most of them children and women, according to Palestinian sources, which necessitated the trial of Tel Aviv before the International Court of Justice on the grounds of committing genocide.\n\nIsraeli Channel 12 said that the army began preparations to launch an operation in Rafah in the event of the collapse of prisoner negotiations, while Washington asked Tel Aviv to allow the arrival of American officers to participate in developing plans regarding the invasion operation. Channel 12 indicated that the Israeli army has taken actual steps, including beginning to isolate the city and preparing to evacuate civilians. The channel added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the purchase of 40,000 tents from China to set up in Gaza in preparation for the ground operation in Rafah.\n\nIsraeli Channel 13 said that the administration of US President Joe Biden recently asked Israel to allow the arrival of American officers, to make plans regarding Rafah with Israeli army officers. The channel added that American officers are expected to arrive soon, and quoted a senior Israeli official that the United States sending officers to discuss the operation in Rafah is an indication of lack of trust.\n\nMeanwhile, Netanyahu said during his meeting with members of Congress that the northern Gaza Strip has many places where civilians can go during the army's operation in Rafah. The Israeli Prime Minister added, \"We are told that you cannot enter Rafah. If you do, there will be a humanitarian catastrophe and many deaths will occur. This is not true.\" He continued, \"There are many places in the north of the Strip that people can move to. If they were moved to the south, now they can return to the north. They can return with their tents.\"\n\nIn this context, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said that Netanyahu's office agreed to reschedule the Israeli delegation's visit to Washington to discuss the possible military operation in Rafah. Jean-Pierre added that the White House is working with the Israeli side to set a date for the upcoming meeting, \"and this is a good thing.\" She explained that constructive talks were held with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant during the past two days, noting that the Rafah issue was one of the topics discussed.\n\nThe US State Department had confirmed that it had ideas about alternatives to the military operation in Rafah that could lead to the elimination of Hamas brigades there, she said. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday in response to a question from reporters whether a limited military operation in Rafah could eliminate the remaining Hamas leaders, Miller said, \"Yes.\" Regarding the prisoner exchange negotiations, Miller said that Washington still believes that the negotiations on a humanitarian truce in Gaza have not ended and have not reached a dead end, adding that Washington believes that there is a possibility of continuing prisoner release talks with Hamas.\n\nChannel 12 indicated that the Israeli army has taken actual steps, including beginning to isolate the city and preparing to evacuate civilians. The channel added that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the purchase of 40,000 tents from China to set up in Gaza in preparation for the ground operation in Rafah. Meanwhile, Israeli Channel 13 said that the administration of US President Joe Biden recently asked Israel to allow the arrival of American officers, to make plans regarding Rafah with Israeli army officers. The channel added that American officers are expected to arrive soon, and quoted a senior Israeli official that the United States sending officers to discuss the operation in Rafah is an indication of lack of trust.\n\nA report by the American newspaper \"The Wall Street Journal\" revealed that the meetings held during the past two days between the Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, and senior officials in the White House and the Pentagon, \"did not focus on how to prevent\" the planned Israeli military operation in Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip. Rather, it is to \"protect civilians as the operation begins.\" The newspaper pointed out that the talks \"came in contrast to the American tone during the past weeks,\" as senior officials explicitly warned Israel against launching a comprehensive operation against Rafah, to which more than a million people were displaced with the start of Israeli military operations in the Strip.\n\nOn Tuesday, during his meeting with Gallant, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that \"protecting Palestinian civilians\" during the war between Israel and Hamas is a \"moral and strategic necessity,\" adding that the situation in the besieged Gaza Strip is \"a humanitarian catastrophe that is worsening.\" US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Tuesday that protecting Palestinian civilians during the war between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) is a moral and strategic necessity, adding that the situation in the besieged Gaza Strip is a humanitarian catastrophe that is worsening.\n\nAustin added: \"In Gaza today, the number of civilian casualties is very high and the volume of humanitarian aid is very low... Gaza is suffering a humanitarian catastrophe and the situation is getting worse,\" using his harshest language since the beginning of the crisis. Following the meeting, the Pentagon said that Austin had a \"frank and direct\" discussion with Gallant. Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the Israeli Defense Minister also met for the second day with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who informed Gallant that Israel \"needs to allow an increase in the flow of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that dealing with Rafah has long been at the heart of the growing dispute between the United States and Israel, which escalated with the United States not using its veto, Monday, to stop a UN Security Council resolution \"for an immediate ceasefire and the release of... \"All hostages immediately and unconditionally\" in Gaza. The newspaper quoted a prominent American defense official as saying that there is a \"sequence... where the military aspect should not continue until the humanitarian aspects are fully addressed.\"\n\nThe two parties agreed on \"the necessity of expelling Hamas from Rafah, so that its members cannot return or continue to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip, which is a basic condition for ending the war and paving the way towards a new political authority in Gaza, which means trying to find ways to work with Israel on a strategy in Rafah.\" \"In light of the lack of other options,\" according to the newspaper. She also explained that the two sides \"discussed ways to confront the smuggling of weapons across the Egyptian border into Gaza,\" which Israel considers a source of concern, in addition to \"the precise targeting of Hamas leaders.\"\n\nUS Department of Defense officials explained to the newspaper that the plans \"still have a long way to go before they are formalized, and any convincing plan to transfer civilians from Rafah may take a month.\" The Wall Street Journal also confirmed that the talks this week were strikingly \"different\" compared to what happened last week, when Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the Israelis that a major ground operation risked \"further isolation of Israel around the world.\"\n\nUS Vice President Kamala Harris also warned Israel that it may face \"consequences\" if it carries out its threat to launch a ground military operation in Rafah, south of the Gaza Strip. Harris said in an interview with the American network ABC, part of which was broadcast on Sunday: \"I do not rule out that there will be American consequences for Israel if it continues to storm Rafah militarily.\" She continued: \"We made clear to Israel in every way, and in several conversations, that any major military operation in Rafah would be a big mistake.\"\n\nIDF and Shin Bet forces continue targeted fighting in the area of Shifa' hospital. The combat teams of the 401st Brigade, the Nahal Brigade and the 13th Fleet under the command of the 162nd Division are fighting in the area while avoiding harm to civilians, patients, medical teams and medical equipment. From the beginning of the activity in the Shifa area until now, about 200 terrorists had been eliminated in the hospital area.\n\nIn the last day, terrorists came out of the emergency room at Shifa' hospital and opened fire at the forces operating in the hospital area, this is in addition to the shooting that was carried out at the IDF forces from the emergency room in the last few days. During the operation, the forces evacuated shelters, patients and medical teams to alternative medical complexes that the IDF prepared and established in order to allow proper medical treatment to continue.\n\nThe forces of the 98th Division continue to operate in Khan Yunis in the Al Amal area and Al Karara, so far the forces have eliminated dozens of terrorists in the operation in the Al Amal area. The fighters of the combat team of the commando brigade destroyed a terrorist infrastructure where weapons were located. The forces of the 7th Brigade Combat Team located charges and mortar bombs.

The Nahal Brigade's combat team continues to operate in the center of the Gaza Strip and eliminated a number of terrorists over the past day. In one of the attacks, a terrorist squad was identified near the forces, in a quick closing circle an aircraft attacked and eliminated a number of terrorists.\n\n\"In the last few minutes, we received approval from the General Security Service together with the Intelligence Division for the approval of the assassination of a senior Hamas official who we took out at Shifa Hospital,\" the IDF spokesman said in his statement this evening , \"the senior Hamas official we eliminated is Ra'ed Thabat. Thabet served as the head of the supply and personnel corps of the military arm of Hamas.\"\n\n\"In the past, he served as the head of Hamas's production system, he is a center of knowledge for the organization in all things related to equipping and ammunition,\" he continued, \"Ra'ad was in the top ten of the senior military wing. He is close to Sinwar, Def and Issa.\"\n\n\"He was killed during his escape attempt along with two other terrorists into the hospital plaza,\" he concluded, \"which was also in the plan of an attack on our forces. He was killed by the fighters of the 13th Fleet along with other forces in the area of the Nahal patrol, Shaked, and Dovdvan , along with two other terrorists.\"\n\nAl Jazeera's correspondent reported that dozens were martyred and injured as the Israeli bombing continued on the north and south of the Gaza Strip , while Israeli Channel 12 said that the army had begun preparations to launch an operation in Rafah in the event that prisoner negotiations collapse. An Al Jazeera correspondent said that an Israeli bombing targeted a house on Al-Beltaji Street in the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood , east of Gaza City, leaving 3 martyrs and wounding 20 others. The reporter confirmed that there were casualties as a result of an Israeli raid that targeted the vicinity of Al-Qassam Mosque in the Beit Lahia project in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\nA citizen was also martyred by Israeli occupation army gunfire in Hamad Town, north of Khan Yunis , south of the Gaza Strip. Al Jazeera's correspondent said that the Israeli occupation launched raids targeting the city of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip, and other areas north of the Gaza Strip, and another raid targeted the town of Al-Mughraqa, north of Al-Nuseirat, in the center of the Gaza Strip. The reporter pointed out that an Israeli bombing targeted residential buildings in the Al-Rimal neighborhood in central Gaza City .\n\nDuring the night hours, the occupation forces launched an air strike on Al-Shati camp, west of Gaza City. The occupation also launched an air strike on an electrical appliances center in the center of Jabalia camp, which led to a fire breaking out at the site. He added that Israeli military vehicles were firing in the vicinity of Al-Shifa Medical Complex, west of Gaza City, coinciding with artillery shelling.\n\nOn the other hand, the Israeli occupation army announced that one soldier was killed and another was seriously injured in a clash in the southern Gaza Strip yesterday evening, Wednesday. This comes as clashes continue between the resistance factions and the occupation forces in the vicinity of the Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza City, which has been besieged by the occupation for 11 days, while the Israeli army announced that 22 soldiers were injured in Gaza during the past 24 hours.\n\nThe Al-Qassam Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) - announced that its fighters were able to snipe an Israeli soldier in the vicinity of Al-Shifa Medical Complex. For its part, the Al- Quds Brigades - the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement - said that it bombed gatherings of occupation soldiers in the vicinity of the Al-Shifa Complex with 60 mm mortar shells. The Al-Quds Brigades published scenes of the clashes and targeting of the Israeli military vehicle in the vicinity of the Al-Shifa Complex.\n\nThe HAMAS government media office in Gaza said that the information available to it indicates that Israeli occupation soldiers executed more than 200 displaced Palestinians inside the Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza City, and arrested about a thousand others. He confirmed that the occupation soldiers are threatening the medical teams and the displaced people inside the complex by bombing and destroying the buildings above their heads, or going out for investigation, torture, or execution.\n\nDirector of the HAMAS Government Information Office in Gaza, Ismail Al-Thawabta, said that the Israeli occupation is still controlling and occupying the Shifa complex, killing Palestinians, destroying the homes surrounding it, arresting hundreds of sick, wounded, and displaced people, and interrogating, torturing, and starving them. Al-Thawabta stated that the Israeli forces executed 5 doctors and two nurses, and detained a number of other medical staff. He pointed out that the Israeli army combed residential squares in the vicinity of the hospital, and also destroyed and bombed dozens of homes, completely demolishing them, and committed massacres inside the complex against the displaced and detainees.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the West Bank has witnessed a security escalation and incursions by the occupation army since the start of the war on the Gaza Strip on the seventh of last October, which was met with operations launched by members of the Palestinian resistance factions, which caused the death and injury of Israeli soldiers and settlers.\n\nAt least three Israelis were injured by fire fired at a settler bus and several vehicles near the town of Al-Auja, north of the city of Jericho in the Jordan Valley, on Thursday morning. The Israeli army said that its forces arrived at the scene, closed the area, and began combing operations in search of the attackers who fled. An Israeli ambulance spokesman reported that the shooting occurred in two close locations in the same area, where the attackers also targeted Israeli cars.\n\nIsraeli Army Radio said that the shooting in the Jordan Valley resulted in three people being seriously, moderately, and slightly injured. Shortly after the shooting, the Israeli occupation army closed the entrances to the city of Jericho and began combing the area. Eyewitnesses reported that the occupation army deployed its forces in the area, closed all entrances to the city with military barriers, and prevented the movement of citizens to and from it, and also prevented movement on main streets in the Jordan Valley.\n\nEyewitnesses said that Israeli drones were roaming the skies of the region. The Israeli authorities also announced the closure of the King Hussein Bridge - also known as the Karama crossing - on the border with Jordan after the operation.\n\nTonight, the security forces arrested 18 wanted persons throughout Judea and Samaria. \"This morning in the early hours,\" explained the commander of the Dokifat Battalion, Lt. Col. Sahar Moedim, \"a terrorist opened fire on several vehicles and wounded several Israeli civilians. From that moment, the battalion, the forces of the Bekaa Brigade and special forces, we all jumped to carry out scans in the area. We are here, and we will continue to be until we find the terrorist, until we locate him and neutralize him.\"\n\nThe combat team of the commando formation raided from several directions on the heart of the Al Amal neighborhood in Khan Yunis; The forces located hundreds of weapons in the neighborhood. A suspect arrived by car at the Bekaa crossing near the village of Taysir. After refusing to be checked by the soldiers who were there, the suspect broke through the barrier. IDF forces started chasing him and arrested him. There were no casualties to Israeli forces and the suspect was handed over to the security forces for further treatment.\n\nToday (Thursday) an exercise was carried out in a surprise format. The purpose of the exercise was to strengthen the IDF's readiness for various scenarios in the northern arena. The multi-armed exercise was led by the Operations Division, and included the commands, arms and wings as well as the General Staff.\n\nThe air defense fighters successfully intercepted using the \"Yahlom\" system a suspicious aerial target in the territory of Lebanon, which is suspected to have made its way towards the north of the country. One of the interceptors launched exploded over the sky of the country, the incident is being investigated. During the day, a number of launches were detected that crossed the territory of Lebanon to various areas in the north of the country. IDF forces attacked the sources of the shooting.\n\nThe United States Central Command (CENTCOM) overnight destroyed four long-range unmanned aerial systems launched by Houthis. According to the CENTCOM's statement, the attack targeted a U.S. warship in the Red Sea. Between 2:00 and 2:20 a.m. (Sanaa time) on March 27, United States Central Command successfully engaged and destroyed four long-range unmanned aerial systems (UAS) launched by Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists in Yemen. These UAS were aimed at a U.S. warship and engaged in self-defense over the Red Sea. There were no injuries or damage reported to U.S. or coalition ships. It was determined these weapons presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region. These actions are taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for U.S. Navy and merchant vessels.\n\nThe leader of the Yemeni Ansar Allah movement, Mr. Abdul-Malik Badr al-Din al-Houthi, confirmed that the tragedy in Gaza is getting bigger, the crimes are becoming more brutal every day, and the criminal Zionist killer is becoming more persistent, persistent, and barbaric, noting that the time of control, colonialism, subjugation and enslavement of peoples through extermination and intimidation to force surrender has passed and ended.\n\nIn his speech about the latest developments and developments, Mr. Al-Houthi pointed out that the impudence and insistence of the American partner on supporting and protecting the Zionist crime is increasing, and the responsibility is increasing on Muslims before others and then on the rest of the peoples of human society. Mr. Al-Houthi stated that what is happening in Gaza is a disgrace to all of humanity and a warning to everyone of the Zionist threat and the barbaric American colonialism.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi addressed the criminal Zionists, saying: Your crimes will certainly take you faster on the path of inevitable demise that God has threatened you with in His books. You are occupiers, and blood is a curse upon you and will sweep you from the land of Palestine, and your injustice will not be forgotten by generations and will be engraved in their consciousness, revenge against you for those who are oppressed, hostility toward you, and discontent with you. Blood flows through the arteries of all free people.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi stressed that the time of control, colonialism , subjugation and enslavement of peoples through extermination and intimidation to force surrender has passed and ended. Mr. Al-Houthi said: Go back a little to history to remember what happened to you in Vietnam, in Iraq, and in other countries. In this battle, you are in greater trouble and your loss is heavy, as you sacrifice the interests of your people in the service of the Zionists.\n\nAddressing the Americans, Mr. Al-Houthi said: You are being exposed to damage that you will not be able to compensate for for generations, and if you persist, the consequences will be worse, greater, and more dangerous. You will inherit disappointment and defeat from Britain, and the British pamper is the pamper of disappointments, defeats, and failure of your prot\u00e9g\u00e9, \"Israel,\" which you planted in our region. Here is its army actually exposed to a historical scandal.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi explained that the Israeli enemy army, for half a year, was unable to achieve an image of military victory in the narrowest geographical area, while the enemy army fought a fierce battle for 5 hours, with the participation of a helicopter and drone with one of the Palestinian heroes in Ramallah, where one resistance fighter attacked the enemy soldiers. And his settlers for nearly half a day alone. Mr. Al-Houthi pointed out that the Kuwait roundabout has become a scene for Zionist starvation crimes every week.\n\nHe added that behind the landing operation was an American plan, in coordination with the Israelis on the ground, to kill the people in the places where aid was dropped, noting that the American seeks to turn the process of landing aid into causing problems, and that the brutal American practices bring down the flimsy walls that the hypocrites and deceived people have erected before the people's awareness so that they do not see the truth of America's brutality as it is. America's brutality in Gaza must bring about an awakening in people's awareness and the falsehood towards it and its agents must be dropped.\n\nHe said that the Israeli enemy puts the displaced people between the options of death from starvation, epidemics, or murder, while it declares a safe area, and then when people gather there, it targets it, as happened this week in Al-Mawasi camp, and for the second week in a row, the Israeli enemy continues its storming and siege of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex, again creating a tragedy for patients and staff. Health and displaced people.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi continued, saying: The Israeli enemy has made hospitals primary targets for its criminal and brutal attack operations, and the Israeli enemy is actively seeking to create a rift between the Mujahideen and the Palestinian tribes with regard to the method of distributing aid. The Israeli enemy has failed and disappointed in causing a rift between the tribes and the Mujahideen due to the tribes' steadfastness in their position of embracing the resistance. He noted that the continued Israeli failure is also a failure of the American partner in the crime of genocide and comprehensive destruction of Gaza.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi reminded that the Mujahideen on all fronts of the fighting are inflicting losses on the enemy's ranks and vehicles, and that after the enemy celebrated the end of the Mujahideen's missile stock, missiles were launched from areas that the enemy had declared control towards Ashdod, explaining that the recruitment crisis is an ongoing crisis and a witness to the great failure of the Israeli enemy.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi noted that what testifies to the enemy's failure and failure is the continued adverse migration from Palestine and the flight of Zionist Jews from there. The enemy's economic losses are constantly on the rise, and Hezbollah's operations have had a significant impact on the enemy's factories in northern occupied Palestine, and Hezbollah continues on its direct and influential front. On the Israeli enemy and inflicts daily losses on the Israeli enemy.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi stressed, saying: Our front in Yemen in the battle of the promised conquest and the holy jihad, thanks to God and with His success, is an active, continuous and effective front. We hope and pray to God that His Prophet, may God's prayers be upon him and his family, will show our people in this battle what his eyes will recognize and what the faces of our people will be brightened with on the Day of Resurrection. 10 operations were carried out this week, using 37 ballistic and winged missiles and drones, and 9 ships were targeted this week, bringing the total number of ships targeted to 86 ships linked to the Israeli enemy, America and Britain.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi explained that the movement of the enemy at sea has become rare and he is trying to camouflage it to the maximum extent, and he is trying to mislead the media and information. The movement of enemy ships is similar to a smuggling operation. However, it fails and the attack is carried out effectively. A missile bombardment was carried out with winged missiles towards Umm Al-Rashrash to target affiliated targets. The Israeli enemy, thank God, has the impact of military operations at sea as well as on Palestine, and the enemy's inability to stop them is a clear issue that the enemy acknowledges. It is a great blessing that God grants success in effective action on the enemy, starting with his economic situation, which he relies on in his military aggression.\n\nMr. Al-Houthi pointed out that the only solution is to stop the aggression, crimes, and siege on the Gaza Strip, and that the bad state that the American Navy has reached is the result of American intransigence and failure to accept the correct and fair solution. American intransigence in supporting Zionist crime and aggression against our country has put it in a real dilemma, noting that the bad state What the US Navy has reached is the result of American intransigence and failure to accept the correct and fair solution. American intransigence in supporting Zionist crime and aggression against our country has put it in a real dilemma.\n\nHe said that some countries are moving in harmony with the Israeli enemy on the media level and some domestication activities. Our people are embarking on their exit from the standpoint of their faith and sense of responsibility, and they sense the unparalleled suffering of the Palestinian people. In contrast to the magnitude of the tragedy of the Palestinian people, the responsibility is truly greater in taking a serious stand for jihad and taking a stand and taking action in every way. In the areas, if we do not move to support the Palestinian people in an oppression as great as theirs, then when can we move?!! If we do not carry the banner of jihad for the sake of God Almighty against the Israeli, American and British Zionist tyranny and criminality, then against whom and when will we fight?\n\nThe political pressure on Israel is increasing with another proposal for a cease-fire coming up in the UN Security Council. This is another proposal that Israel opposes, but this time it comes from a Western friend - France, a permanent member of the Security Council, which has begun circulating a draft in favor of an immediate cease-fire during Ramadan. Israel has already made it clear that they will oppose it in the existing version, which includes recognition of a Palestinian state and full membership in the United Nations, condemnation of the violence in the settlements and confirmation that the settlements are illegal from the point of view of the United Nations. Although the text contains a section calling for the release of the abductees and even condemning Hamas, the fear is that this will be one of the first sections to be removed as part of the negotiations on the draft, as is usually the case in discussions on resolutions.\n\nThe judges of the International Court of Justice unanimously ordered Israel to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure the entry of basic food supplies to the residents of the Gaza Strip without delay. The court said, in a statement, that the Palestinians in Gaza face difficult living conditions in light of the spread of famine, and it also ordered Israel to take the necessary and effective measures to cooperate with the United Nations without delay.\n\nThe Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ( UNRWA ), Philippe Lazzarini, had revealed that Israel had informed them that it would no longer agree to send food convoys to the northern Gaza Strip, demanding that \"these restrictions be lifted.\"\n\nIn its statement, the court stressed that Israel must urgently provide basic services and humanitarian aid without hindrance on a large scale, increase the capacity and number of land crossing points into Gaza and keep them open for as long as necessary. The International Court of Justice added that Israel must ensure that its army does not commit violations of the rights of Palestinians in Gaza, such as preventing the delivery of aid. It indicated that Israel must submit a report to the court regarding the measures it will take within a month from today's date.\n\nCommenting on the court's decision, the spokesperson for the South African team told the Al Jazeera Court of Justice that the new court order for Israel requires it to cooperate with the United Nations, and this includes cooperation with UNRWA. He stressed that Israel would not comply with the court's orders, so its allies must put pressure on it. In this context, the US State Department announced that it currently has no position on the International Court of Justice's order for Israel to ensure that aid enters Gaza without obstacles.\n\nThe Director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , said today, Thursday, that 10 hospitals out of 36 are partially operating in Gaza and the health system is barely surviving. He called for an immediate halt to Israeli attacks on hospitals in Gaza, and for the protection of staff, patients and civilians. Ghebreyesus warned of the consequences of the collapse of the health system in the besieged Gaza Strip. He said on the X platform: With only 10 partially functioning hospitals out of 36, the health system in Gaza is barely surviving. He pointed out that the Palestinian Red Crescent Society announced on Tuesday that Al-Amal Hospital in the city of Khan Yunis (south) had stopped working as a result of the ongoing Israeli army attacks on the facility and its environs.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas approved the formation of the new Palestinian government headed by economist Muhammad Mustafa, who retained the foreign ministry, two weeks after his appointment. The Palestinian News and Information Agency (Wafa) reported that the new government, which does not include the names of former ministers except for Interior Minister Ziad Hab Al-Rih, will be sworn in before the president next Sunday.\n\nAbbas issued a decision to grant confidence to the government in accordance with the Palestinian Basic Law (the Constitution), which grants the president this right in the absence of the dysfunctional Legislative Council. The government includes 23 independent and professional ministers, and Wafa Agency explained that the government's program confirmed that its political authority is the Palestine Liberation Organization , \"the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nIn turn, Mustafa said, \"The first national priority is a ceasefire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza .\" He added, \"We will work to develop visions for the reunification of institutions, including assuming responsibility in Gaza.\" Mustafa, an independent economist, was chosen to form this government to implement reforms in the institutions of the Palestinian Authority that the United States of America and other international bodies have long demanded, in preparation for the stage that will follow the end of the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Saudi newspaper Al-Sharq Al-Ost reported from Palestinian sources that after Hamas lost many operatives and suffered a blow including the military, it decided to change its strategy in order to reach the \"day after the war\" with fewer losses. The terrorist organization decided to adopt a policy based on limited attacks against IDF forces, in a way that would not pose a danger to terrorists and to \"preserve part of its forces\", according to the report.\n\n\"The organization does not want to lose everything. It wants to keep part of its forces for the day after the campaign. Israel, the US, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries have their plans for the day after the war, and Hamas also has its plan,\" the sources told the newspaper.\n\nA source in the field told Al-Sharq Al-Aust that \"the repetition of the abduction operations carried out by Israel in the northern areas of the Gaza Strip and at Shifa, Al-Amal and Nazar hospitals in Khan Yunis shows the way Israel decided to operate in the Gaza Strip, an attempt to replicate what it implements in the West Bank\". According to them, this means expanding Israel's security control and carrying out targeted operations from time to time. The newspaper noted that as a result, the terrorist organizations were forced to \"also change their tactics and prepare for a longer campaign with fewer losses.\"\n\nAlthough Hamas does not have a clear estimate of how and when the war will end, it is betting that the kidnapped card will be the \"winning card\". The sources stated that \"Hamas does not intend to give up this card, because it understands its importance and makes it insist on receiving a commitment to end the war, even at a later stage, before signing a new agreement.\"\n\nThe sources who spoke to the Saudi newspaper confirmed that the military wing of Hamas and other terrorist organizations \"have lost most of their rocket power, but they still have a stockpile of rockets that they may use at any moment, especially if the war is nearing its end, in an attempt to achieve a victory image. This is indicated The latest barrages towards Ashdod, Ashkelon and Sderot\". They added that Hamas has many missiles to attack IDF forces, vehicles, mortar bombs, explosive charges and other weapons and ammunition.\n\nThe High Court issued a decision endorsing a universal draft, including the Haredi sector starting April 1 as a matter of principle, while in practice deferring any enforcement until August 9.\n\nAcademics suggested that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will side with his partners in the \"extreme right-wing coalition\" in the crisis of recruiting ultra-Orthodox Jews, even if it requires the exit of War Council Minister Benny Gantz. The academic and expert on Israeli affairs, Dr. Muhannad Mustafa, said that Netanyahu is facing the biggest political crisis that exceeds his crisis with Washington, believing that he will prefer to go for a law that is largely consistent with the aspirations of the religious parties, even if it costs him the withdrawal of Gantz, who has been a political, social, and international cover for the \"right-wing\" government since the beginning of the war.\n\nThe second scenario - which Mustafa rules out happening - is to adopt a law that is closer to the secular parties, which will lead to the loss of the religious parties and the fall of the government. Netanyahu is also trying to avoid going to early elections, which implicitly means stopping the war on Gaza, in addition to the fall of him and the \"right-wing\" camp and the formation of an alternative government headed by Gantz, according to the expert on Israeli affairs.\n\nMustafa confirms that the current crisis comes in the context of the occupation army's need for reserve soldiers, after neglecting this issue, including the recruitment of Haredim , indicating that Israel has a final opportunity to legislate the law after the Supreme Court overturned previous laws. He adds that Netanyahu's government is obligated to enact this law, \"and without it, the government will not be able to exempt the Haredim,\" and it must present the law to the Knesset next June to vote on it.\n\nIn turn, Dr. Hassan Ayoub, professor of political science at An-Najah University in Palestine, confirms that the Haredi recruitment crisis highlights the extent of political opportunism, whether on the part of Netanyahu or his partners in the coalition or the opposition. He confirms that the crisis is not only related to military calculations in light of the army's need for more manpower, but there is an economic aspect related to the state budget, before summarizing the scene as a crisis defined by the state itself. He believes that the crisis will cast a shadow by creating a rift in Israeli society between the liberal secular side and the religious side, adding that it is difficult to get out of this impasse and stressing the necessity of concluding a new deal.\n\nThe Palestinian academic believes that the issue of Haredi recruitment seriously threatens the survival of Netanyahu's government because all parties have become entrenched and extremist in a way that does not seem to have a way out, ruling out that Netanyahu will escape the pressure of this crisis. Regarding the nature of these religious parties, Mustafa explains that the Haredim constitute 13% of Israeli society and are expected to reach 20% in 2050. He added that it is an extremist religious group that does not recognize Zionism and lives in geographically isolated neighborhoods that differ in their dress. It has succeeded in integrating while preserving its political and cultural interests, especially education in closed neighborhoods.\n\nHe shows that the Haredi group is one of the highest groups in terms of population growth, as the rate of birth of Haredi women is between 7 and 8 children. They also do not study English, mathematics, and science, and are limited to religious curricula. \"Therefore, they are uneducated, uncultured, unproductive, and consuming, and are not integrated into the Israeli economy.\"\n\nHaaretz newspaper quoted a letter sent by the Israeli government's judicial advisor, Gali Behrav Meara, to the Israeli Supreme Court, stating that the recruitment of religious Haredim must begin from the beginning of next month. The content of the letter stated that \"recruitment authorities must act with regard to the recruitment procedures for those whose service has been postponed according to the law or for those who have reached the Haredi conscription age, leaving the method of implementation for later.\" The letter also stated that the government will not be able to transfer budget funds to religious centers and schools for those who do not send a request for conscription and those who are not conscripts.\n\nThe newspaper added that the Israeli Attorney General's Office had opposed the attempt of Benjamin Netanyahu's government to extend the deadline for the draft law on conscription of ultra-Orthodox Jews. The Board of Grievances had asked to extend the submission of the application until Thursday afternoon, which the newspaper considered a slap on the part of the judicial advisor to Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n\nThe Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth previously reported that the religious parties in the ruling coalition threatened to withdraw if a new conscription law was adopted that abolished the exemption enjoyed by religious Jews. The newspaper added that the religious Jewish parties are threatening to withdraw from the government if the percentage of those who will be forced to conscript is determined in the draft law that the government is trying to pass.\n\nFor its part, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation quoted the leaders of the Haredi parties as saying - during a meeting with Netanyahu - that the demands to put an end to the exemption of religious people from military service contradict the agreement to form the coalition. Haredi leaders added that there is a fear that the rabbis will ask them to withdraw from the government if a new law abolishing the exemption is passed.\n\nNetanyahu's right-wing government had sought to enact a law exempting the Haredim from military service, which opened the door wide to interactions in Israel between supporters and opponents, which heralded a crisis within the emergency government. While the religious parties oppose compromising the principle of exempting religious people from military service, ministers including War Council member Benny Gantz, Defense Minister Yoav Galant, and opposition leader Yair Lapid are calling for an end to this exemption.\n\nWar Council member Benny Gantz had threatened to withdraw if the Knesset approved a draft law maintaining the exemption of religious people from military conscription, and from Washington, Gallant announced that he would not support the draft law in its current form that maintains the exemption of the Haredim from military service. As for the opposition leader, he attacked Netanyahu and the conscription law in its current form, and Lapid called on members of the Likud Party to oppose the proposed law, which he described as a conscription evasion law. Since 2017, successive governments have failed to reach a consensus law regarding the recruitment of Haredim, after the Supreme Court annulled a law enacted in 2015, which ruled to exempt them from military service, considering that it violates the \"principle of equality.\"\n\nAt a time when Israel insists on continuing its military operations in the Gaza Strip, in pursuit of its declared goals, which are the release of hostages held in the Strip and \"eliminating Hamas,\" many believe that the country \"cannot reconcile\" the two goals, which has become clear. The Israelis' positions on this matter differ, according to what the American newspaper \" Wall Street Journal \" reported. Israelis are divided over how to prioritize the country's two main war goals: \"destroying\" Hamas, and freeing some 130 hostages, including more than 30 bodies of hostages killed after they were kidnapped nearly six months ago.\n\nDivisions have escalated as Israel negotiates with Hamas, through the United States, Egypt and Qatar, over a ceasefire that could last 6 weeks and see the release of 40 hostages. These hostages will be children, the elderly, the sick and women, including female soldiers. Hamas demands that Israel release thousands of Palestinian prisoners, some of whom are considered \"terrorists\" in Israel. Hamas also wants Israel to agree to concessions that could preserve the group's control of Gaza, even after the group, designated by the United States as a terrorist organization, planned and carried out the worst attack in Israel's history.\n\nMitchell Barak, a political analyst at Keyvon Global Research based in Jerusalem, said: \"The two goals contradict each other, and both cannot happen,\" adding: \"No side will be happy here.\" Forty-seven percent of Israeli Jews participating in the most recent public poll on the issue, conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute in January, said Israel \"should prioritize freeing the hostages,\" while 42 percent said it \"should put the destruction of Hamas first.\" The poll found that those who favored the release of the hostages \"largely voted for left or center parties,\" while those who favored the destruction of Hamas \"supported right-wing and religious parties.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set eliminating Hamas and freeing the hostages as two goals to \"win\" the war, but analysts say that reconciling them is an \"almost impossible task.\" On the one hand, there are Israelis from the center and left and most of the hostage families, who have become a political force since the war began, and are willing to pay a heavy price for their freedom. They claim, according to the newspaper, that the state \"has a fundamental moral duty towards the hostages, which if violated would undermine citizens' sense of security in the foreseeable future.\" They also say that \"Hamas can be fought in the future, but the hostages may die in the present.\"\n\nBut Israel's right wing - Netanyahu's political base - \"largely opposes, on moral grounds, any agreement that allows Hamas to remain in power and releases thousands of prisoners involved in terrorist attacks, because it would endanger Israel's national security and the lives of future citizens and soldiers.\" According to the Wall Street Journal. They say the hostages should be released \"by forcing Hamas to release them, as a result of military pressure.\"\n\nThe American newspaper reported that social scientists considered that the division between liberals and conservatives in Israel, over the price that must be paid to free the hostages, \"reflects their basic views about the relationship between citizens and the state.\" \"For many religious and right-wing Israelis, the group and the state are above the individual,\" said Menachem Mautner, a professor at Tel Aviv University's Faculty of Law. \"The individual is supposed to serve the group.\" As for the left movement in Israel, according to Mautner, \"the state, first and foremost, is a tool for preserving our (its citizens) lives.\"\n\nFormer Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben Ami said that the United States wanted to bend Israel's arm by refraining from announcing a veto against a draft resolution for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip last week, and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now convinced that US President Joe Biden wants to overthrow it. In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais, the last Israeli foreign minister in a government led by the Labor Party said that Biden was fed up with Netanyahu and that abstaining from using the veto in the Security Council was \"part of a progressive strategy to send signals to Israel that things can change.\" The abstention was a severe blow to Netanyahu, and its importance exceeded the importance of other similar steps in recent years.\n\nAccording to Ben Ami, the change in the American position appeared, for example, in a statement by Biden leaked to the media that Netanyahu had become a burden, but he does not see the abstention from using the veto as a change in the American strategy in the Middle East as much as he sees it as an attempt to twist Israel's arm, which made Netanyahu convinced that Biden wants to bring him down. Ben-Ami said that although Washington was keen to limit itself to abstaining from voting for the resolution (which was not binding), its step clearly expressed a willingness to go further in the pressure, especially if Netanyahu's rule continued, which, according to him, would be as embarrassing as it was Biden, and he stated that the close and volatile relationship between the two parties was wise. There are always clear limits, which are not to obstruct American geopolitical interests or the goals of the White House resident .\n\nHe explained that Biden cannot launch the election season burdened by the burden of the failure of his strategy in the Middle East, not to mention his need to save face before world leaders. Ben Ami - who was one of the architects of the Israeli-Arab peace processes in the past few decades - added that Israel is living in a state of isolation and described it as \"a threat to Western goals in the current cold war between the United States on the one hand and China and Russia on the other hand.\"\n\nAccording to the former minister, Biden had a clear strategy in the Middle East, based on a solid alliance with Israel and the Arab countries against Iran , and the great success of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) was in dragging Netanyahu into a war without clear political goals that removed Israel from the Western alliance that had been established. Recent years, which supports Ukraine against Russia and China.\n\nBen Ami referred to what he calls the extremely sudden explosion against Israel in the world, the likes of which has never happened before, and according to him this is a great victory for Hamas, and he said that what prevents confronting this explosion is Netanyahu's extremist government. He also warned Israel against being blind to the major trends present in American society and seeking to distance itself from Israel, whether in the Democratic Party or among young people, and held Netanyahu responsible for the rise in popularity of the more extreme trends in American society, such as evangelicals or \"Trumpism.\"\n\nThe former Israeli minister noted another damage caused by the Prime Minister, which was the rift in American Jewish support. He said that Netanyahu and his extremist government were able to split the ranks of American Jews who have never failed to support Israel, to the point that there is now among them a movement calling for the adoption of a new ideology that ends dependence on Israel.\n\nA US State Department official working in the field of human rights in the Middle East announced her resignation on Wednesday in protest against Washington's support for Israel in its war on Gaza, according to a report published by the Washington Post. Annelle Sheline (38 years old) submitted her resignation from the US State Department, where she had been working as a foreign affairs officer in the Office of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor for about a year.\n\nThis is considered the second resignation of US State Department officials in protest against the US policy of supporting Israel in its war on Gaza, after the resignation of Josh Paul, who was responsible for arms transfers to foreign governments. In an article published by CNN , Sheline explained the reasons that prompted her to resign, noting that she strongly believes in her work in promoting human rights in the Middle East.\n\nShe added that \"as a representative of a government working directly to enable what the International Court of Justice said could be genocide in Gaza, this work has become almost impossible, and due to my inability to serve an administration that allows such atrocities, I have decided to resign from my position in the State Department.\" \"The credibility that the United States had as a defender of human rights has almost completely disappeared since the war began,\" Sheline said in her article. She continued that through her public resignation, she knew that she \"would likely be deprived of any future work in the State Department,\" noting that she had been appointed to a two-year contract, but when she began to tell her colleagues about her position, their response was, \"Please speak on our behalf\", referring to the dissatisfaction of many State Department employees with Washington's policy of supporting Israel in the war.\n\nNot every number is reported every day, so sudden jumps generally reflect reporting artifacts rather than actual upticks. Many of these numbers fluctate, up and down, with no apparent explanation. This list records the highest number reliably reported for each matter, under the theory that reality with catch up with reports, as is relentlessly the case.",

        "title": "Good Friday:  Timeless Message Of Sacrifice, Redemption - :::...The Tide News Online:::...",
        "body": "As the sombre clouds gather and the world pauses to observe Good Friday, it presents an opportune moment for deep reflection on the profound significance of this day in the Christian calendar. At Good Friday, the most solemn day in the Christian calendar, we commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, a pivotal event that carries profound implications for believers and non-believers alike. Beyond its religious connotations, Good Friday serves as a timeless reminder of the enduring themes of sacrifice, redemption, and the human capacity for transformation.\n\nAt its core, Good Friday embodies the ultimate act of selflessness and love. The narrative of Jesus willingly accepting crucifixion as a means to atone for humanity's sins speaks to the depths of compassion and empathy. In a world often charactersed by selfish pursuits and division, the message of Good Friday transcends religious boundaries, resonating with all who aspire to emulate the virtues of sacrifice and compassion in their lives.\n\nThe concept of redemption lies at the heart of the Good Friday narrative. Through his suffering and death, Jesus offers a path to redemption and forgiveness for all. This notion of divine grace transcends mere theological doctrine, extending an invitation to individuals of every background to confront their shortcomings, seek forgiveness and strive for spiritual renewal. In a world, a country, Nigeria, marked by brokenness and despair, the promise of redemption offers a beacon of hope and restoration.\n\nGood Friday therefore brings a message of hope to suffering Nigerians with the assurance that the whole problem will one day come to an end; that as Jesus, crucified on Good Friday conquered death and resurrected on Easter morning, there will certainly be light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nGood Friday is also a day that reminds Christians that they must die, and offers them the opportunity to reflect on where they will be after death and how they have contributed both individually and collectively to the current poor state of Nigeria across all sectors.\n\nToday, Christians of various denominations troop to churches, some who for several reasons cannot make it to their places of worship will get glued to their television sets to participate in Good Friday activities, including the last station of the Cross for the Lenten season (for Catholics), the veneration of the Cross among others. Often, one wonders what better society it will be, particularly in Nigeria, if Christians who make up a large proportion of the nation's population will put the lessons of Good Friday into practice instead of seeing it as a mere annual ritual.\n\nTo what extent has this impacted on the lives of Christians in the country? Do they recognise and accept suffering and pain, as a will of God for their salvation or reject them as \"not their portion?\" Often, we have heard some Christians including some renowned leaders, claim that suffering is not from God but from the devil. Today's remembrance, therefore, presents these and other Christians a good opportunity to reflect on the significance and centrality of the Cross in their lives.\n\nJesus was a selfless leader who bore all these travails for the unwavering love he had for mankind, capping it with a shameful death on the Cross, even though He committed no crime. Can we find such altruistic leaders among Christians in Nigeria? As leaders in our homes, offices, societies, churches and other spheres of influence, can the believers of Christ in the country say they sacrifice all for the people they lead or is it the other way round?\n\nIn Ephesians 5 : 1-2, St Paul said, \"be imitators...and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God,\" Jesus submitted his own life to sacrificial service under the will of God (Luke 22 : 42), and he sacrificed his life freely out of service for others (John 10:30). He came to serve (Matthew 20:28) although he was God's son and was thus more powerful than any other leader in the world. He healed the sick (Mark 7:31-37), drove out demons (Mark 5:1-20), was recognised as Teacher and Lord (John 13:13), and had power over the wind and the sea and even over death (Mark 4:35-41; Matthew 9:18-26).\n\nYet, in John 13:1-17 we see him giving a very practical example of what it means to serve others. He washed the feet of his followers, which was properly the responsibility of the house-servant. He did that out of love, a show of a leader who was ready to render service for his followers when the need arises, a leader who wanted to set an example for his followers to follow.\n\nCan it be said that Nigerian Christians and non-Christians who occupy leadership positions both in religious and secular organisations display this servant-leader style that Jesus teaches? A situation where they lord it over their followers or subordinates, abuse their offices, take undue advantage of the poor to enrich themselves and oppress the people does not show that they are true imitators of Christ. Sometimes when you see the arrogance and mannerism of some Christian leaders, you wonder where they learnt their own version of Christianity from.\n\nOur country today is in dire need of direction. Darkness seems to have covered the land. There is an unprecedented level of insecurity in the land. No one is happy, no one is safe. Kidnapping for money is now a thriving business. Corruption and rabid treasury looting, injustice and ethnicity are the order of the day. Poverty, lack of employment and hunger are now the lot of majority of the populace.\n\nBut the question is, are Christians playing any role to remedy the ugly situation in the country? Do we not think that if the Christians live according to the teachings of the gospel and fail to join the bandwagon in a life of debauchery the story would have been different? We were told that the followers of Jesus were first called Christians in Antioch because their deeds were similar to that of Christ. Can the same be said of Christians in Nigeria, some of whom cheat in the markets, sell fake and adulterated goods and commit other atrocities to make money? How has their adherence to the life and teaching of Jesus impacted on the national ethos and values?\n\nThe marking of passion and death of Jesus Christ by crucifixion should, therefore, be used by Christians to reflect deeply on how they have followed the example of Jesus in both their private and public lives. Christians in Nigeria should seize this opportunity to identify those attitudes that are not in conformity with Jesus' teaching, which put Christianity in a bad light and root them out.\n\nIt is expected that the gains of the 40-day spiritual exercise and the triduum which culminates in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, on Easter morning, will be deployed by Christians towards making Nigeria a better country.\n\nJesus expressed His love for mankind by His selflessness, compassion and kindness. By His love, He diminished the distinction of tribes and tongues and brought all people together. Nigeria needs these virtues more than anything now in order to move this nation forward. The message of Good Friday will help the nation a great deal when every Nigerian, Christians and non-Christians, realises that He does not need to be selfish. Jesus could not have successfully accomplished his salvific mission if he was selfish.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus stands as a testament to the unjust suffering endured by countless individuals throughout history. It calls attention to the plight of the marginalised, the oppressed, and the downtrodden, urging us to confront injustice and stand in solidarity with those who suffer. In a world rife with violence, the message of Good Friday compels us to work tirelessly towards building a more just and compassionate society.",

        "title": "Easter: Hope For Humanity - :::...The Tide News Online:::...",
        "body": "Easter means so much to humanity, especially Christians. It is one of the happiest moments or events those who have realised the value of the death and resurrection of Jesus love to associate with. Did you know why?\n\nIt is the event that reminds regenerated humans through faith in atoning sacrifice of Jesus, that the \"old account has been settled long ago\" by Jesus who is the propitiation of our sin. Through His vicarious suffering and atoning sacrifice, Jesus paid the supreme price for sin, no human could have paid in a life time. And thus becomes our Saviour, our Redeemer and indeed our kinsman-Redeemer.\n\nEaster is a testimonial and testimony that Jesus is alive, because He has the power to lay down His life and to take it. Hallelujah. It is attestation to the fact that Jesus conquered death, the grave could not stop Him from resurrecting.\n\nThis inspires confidence in Christians that death has lost its power. That death is a gate-way to eternal life. It lends credibility to the saying: \"If our hope is only in this life we are of all people most to be pitied\".\n\nFor everyone that has truly encountered the Lord Jesus, with an inside-out transformation, the thought of Easter deepens commitment to Jesus Christ and the Statement of Faith on Him which states: We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. We believe in His virgin birth. We believe in His sinless life. We believe in His atoning sacrifice and His vicarious suffering and death. We believe in His bodily resurrection. We believe in His ascension to the right hand of God the Father. We believe in His return to reign one thousand years.\n\nWhen each of the strands of the Statement of Faith is considered in its merits, the Central message is \"Jesus is God\". He is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world. He is the only Way, Truth and Life\n\nEaster gives hope for depraved humanity that by faith in the finished work of Jesus on Calvary's cross, there is salvation and redemption. Paul, the intrepid apostle and foremost missionary said: It is a faithful saying and worthy to be accepted that Jesus died to save sinners... Therefore, if we confess our sins, Jesus is Faithful and Just to forgive and cleanse us from all unrighteousness\n\nEaster gives validity and significance to Good Friday. If Jesus has not resurrected men will describe Him as a mere impostor. Jesus' death would not have been different from my father's which occurred in 1978. And he is still in the grave. There would not be a distinction between Jesus and the several founders of religions who are dead and are still lying in their graves. And on their grave it is emblazoned, \"Here lies the remains of...,\". But concerning Jesus the angel said, \"He is Risen. He is not Here (not in the grave). Praise God.\n\nEaster makes false theories on the resurrection of Jesus by enemies of the Christian faith, arrant fabrications. Some of those theories are: the Disciples of Jesus stole His body; that Jesus swooned (fainted and got revived in the grave); that those who claim that Jesus has resurrected are suffering from a disease of the mind known as hallucination; that where Jesus was buried was not known to Mary Magdalene and the visitors to the grave.\n\nGiving the benefit of the doubt to those who propound those theories, one would ask if Jesus did not resurrect as they claim, where did fearful disciples derive their boldness from? Where comes the power of salvation or regeneration - the power that changes a sinner to a saint? Why are people giving their life to a \"dead\" Jesus? Why are people being baptized in the Holy Spirit with the initial physical evidence of speaking in a language a person has not learnt in keeping with His word \"tarry in Jerusalem until you are endued with power (And the baptism in the Holy Spirit was received by the 120 in the Upper Room, 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus). No doubt, a lifeless being could not fulfilled his promise.\n\nI can go on and on to ask. And every conscientious and sagacious person will pick holes in the spurious assertions of those who contest the validity of Jesus' Resurrection. Bible's Paul, the apostle by divine inspiration in his apologetics on the resurrection evolved the following propositions: And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain: you are yet in your sins. Then they who are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept. (1 Corinthians 15 verses 17-20).\n\nEaster, therefore speaks volumes of the death of Jesus Christ, His sinless life (a lamb of God without spot and blemish. He was tempted at all points, yet did not sin), His bodily resurrection, His return to reign a thousand years.\n\nThe resurrection of Jesus is an attested fact of history which gives Jesus power over Satan and the kingdom of hell, hence He declared without equivocation, \"All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me,\", And consequently, Jesus delegated power of sonship (heritage) and authority to all believers in him, over the hordes of hell when He said: I give to you power to tread on serpents, on scorpions and on every works of the enemy. And nothing shall hurt you\". A dead fellow lacks the capacity to command: lift up your heads oh you gates and be lifted you everlasting doors and let the King of glory come. He could not have ascribed to Himself,\" The Lord mighty in battle, Strong and Mighty, the Lord of hosts, the King of Glory. Such audacious declaration could not have come from an impostor, a dead person.\n\nLet us celebrate Easter in the consciousness of its significance. Jesus is risen and this existential reality gives us a foretaste of the resurrection of all people, some to eternal life and others to eternal condemnation, depending on who and what they believed.",

        "body": "In the wake of NASA's failed private Moon lander debacle, Japan's attempt is still alive and kicking.\n\nIn a post on X-formerly-Twitter, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) confirmed that SLIM -- an acronym for \"Smart Lander for Investigating Moon\" -- is still alive and transmitting signals after its incredible resurrection earlier this year.\n\n\"Last night, we received a response from #SLIM, confirming that the spacecraft made it through the lunar night for the second time!\" the post reads. \"Since the Sun was still high and the equipment was still hot, we only took some shots of the usual scenery with the navigation camera.\"\n\nLaunched in September, the SLIM mission seemed doomed after the lander's \"20 minutes of terror\" upon making Moonfall, which ultimately resulted in the craft parking itself nose-first on the lunar surface.\n\nDespite that major setback, JAXA worked steadily to bring the lander back from the brink -- but it was still shocking when it seemingly sprang back to life after more than a week of radio silence.\n\nWith Moon landers relying on solar power for energy, they have no choice but to power down during the two-week-long lunar night. As such, it's been pretty touch-and-go for SLIM since it came back to life at the end of January, but it has twice been woken up and directed to collect data by its Terran controllers.\n\nAt the beginning of March, however, JAXA warned as lunar night once again approached that SLIM might not wake up again -- but that didn't mean the agency wasn't going to try.\n\n\"Although the probability of failure will increase due to repeated severe temperature cycles,\" a translation of a March 4 post reads, \"SLIM plans to try [operations] again the next time the sun shines (in late March).\"\n\nWith all that said, however, JAXA seems concerned by some of the more recent findings from SLIM's latest measurements.\n\n\"According to the acquired data, some temperature sensors and unused battery cells are starting to malfunction,\" the recent post reads, \"but the majority of functions that survived the first lunar night was [maintained] even after the second lunar night!\"\n\nAs this latest update indicates, it's clear that SLIM is, for all its upside-down-ness, faring way better on the Moon than, say, Odysseus, its privately-manufactured and publicly-funded American counterpart that was officially pronounced dead earlier this week.\n\nEver polite, the humans behind SLIM's X account did in late February congratulate Odysseus and its creators for a \"successful soft landing on the Moon\" -- but if there ever was a time to gloat, it would be now.",

        "title": "Helldivers 2 Introduces New Stratagems",
        "body": "Expanding the Arsenal: Introducing the MG-101 Heavy Machine Gun and LAS-99 Quasar Cannon\n\nArrowhead, the developer behind Helldivers 2, has unveiled two new Stratagems aimed at aiding players in their ongoing battle against the Automatons and Terminids.\n\nThe first addition is the MG-101 Heavy Machine Gun, priced at 6,000 requisition. Described as a formidable weapon with intense recoil, this Stratagem boasts a three-second call-in time, a 480-second cooldown, and unlimited usage.\n\nJoining the arsenal is the LAS-99 Quasar Cannon, now available in the game. This weapon charges up to unleash a potent, explosive energy burst, albeit with a lengthy cooldown period post-firing. The Quasar Cannon can be acquired for 7,500 requisition and shares similar call-in and cooldown times with the Heavy Machine Gun.\n\nThese new Stratagems mark the first additions to Helldivers 2 since the recent introduction of mechs earlier this month. With Arrowhead specifically mentioning the \"Automaton horde\" in their announcement, these additions are expected to aid players in tackling the current major order focused on combating the alien robots. Notably, the Quasar Cannon has proven effective against Automaton dropships. However, Arrowhead advises against snowball fights, cautioning that they may cause game crashes.\n\nSince its launch in February, Helldivers 2 has defied expectations and emerged as a surprise hit in the gaming world in 2024. Dominating the charts on platforms like Steam and reportedly surpassing three million copies sold, the game's popularity shows no signs of waning. Analysts attribute its success to its addictive gameplay, strategic depth, and engaging multiplayer experience, which have resonated strongly with players of all stripes.\n\nAs Helldivers 2 continues to captivate audiences and carve out its place in the gaming landscape, the game's developers at Arrowhead Studios remain committed to delivering regular updates and new content to keep the player base engaged and entertained. With its growing popularity and dedicated community, Helldivers 2 looks poised to remain a prominent fixture in the gaming zeitgeist for the foreseeable future.",

        "body": "It doesn't take words to communicate with your fellow Helldivers when you're playing Helldivers 2. A lot can be expressed non-verbally, and one of the best ways to do it is through emotes. Here's how to use emotes in Helldivers 2.\n\nTo emote in Helldivers 2, press the B key on PC, or hold left on the D-pad on PS5. Try it out; it's a fun way to express yourself or add spunk to your Helldiver.\n\nIn Helldivers 2, there are five emotes: Explosive Handshake, Hug, High-Five, Scout Handshake, and Rock Paper Scissors.\n\nTo unlock new emotes in Helldivers 2, you have to purchase them in the Acquisition Center by spending Warbond Medals. You acquire Warbond Medals via successfully completing missions or collecting them on the map. The casual Salute is unlocked as your default emote, but you can expand that list as you progress.\n\nOnce you've got yourself a good supply of Medals, head back to your ship and open the Acquisition Center. On PS5, you need to tap the square button to access Acquisitions. On PC, you enter the menu by pressing the R key.\n\nTake note that you do have to spend Medals to unlock more Warbond pages. The more Medals you spend, the further down the list you can go.\n\nHere are all of the emotes in Helldivers 2, and how to unlock them:\n\nThe free Warbond, Helldivers Mobilize, includes five victory poses. If you decide to purchase a Premium Warbond, you get more victory poses to unlock. Steeled Veterans comes included in the Super Citizen edition of the game, but you can also acquire it and subsequent Premium Warbonds by exchanging 1,000 Super Credits.\n\nHere are all of the victory poses in Helldivers 2, and how to unlock them:\n\nTo select emotes and victory poses in Helldivers 2, you need to access them in the Armory menu on your ship. Navigate to the 'Character' tab, where you can customize your diver. Next, scroll down to 'Emote' or 'Victory Pose' and enter the menu to equip the animation of your choice.\n\nWhile you can choose to randomize victory poses in Helldivers 2, you can only equip one emote at a time. Sadly, there is no emote wheel. If you decide to run with the Hug (and you very much should), you are locked to it until you change to something else in the menu.",

        "body": "Arrowhead says it plans to fix the error soon, but for now no more snowball fights\n\nHelldivers 2 is a very good third-person online co-op sci-fi shooter. Like, really good. But, it's not the most stable game, with many players (myself included) failing missions simply because the game has crashed. And now, players are learning that snowballs can lead to some of these far-too-frequent crashes.\n\nHelldivers 2 launched in February to rave reviews and has quickly become one of the biggest success stories of 2024. So many people were trying to play it at launch that the servers kept collapsing on PS5 and PC. It's easily one of 2024's best games so far thanks to its dedication to making combat feel both satisfying and dangerous. You never feel truly safe in Helldivers 2, no matter how many big guns you have or how many players there are in your squad. However, the biggest threat in the game might not be a giant bug or swarm of robots, but instead a snowball.\n\nAs spotted by IGN, in a March 28 post on the official Helldivers 2 Discord server, Arrowhead Games' community lead -- known as Baskinator in the server -- told players to avoid picking up and throwing snowballs in the co-op shooter. This playful option has been a feature since launch on snowy planets, and while the balls don't do much damage, it is fun to toss them at pals or enemies. But, for now, players should avoid tossing snowballs because they can cause crashes.\n\n\"We're aware of a crash caused by picking up and throwing snowballs,\" said Baskinator. \"We hope to have this fixed in the near future, but until then, we advise against snowball throwing!\"\n\nNo more information was shared in the message warning players to avoid snowballs.\n\nSince launch, Helldivers 2 has struggled with technical errors. As previously mentioned, the game's servers were crushed by thousands of people trying to play the game all at the same time. There was also an annoying black screen issue that plagued some players. And as IGN reported, some arc weapons and stratagems were causing crashes earlier this month, leading to a similar warning from the devs to avoid them -- like the snowballs -- until they were fixed in a patch.\n\nIt's a testament to how good Helldivers 2 is that I keep trying to play it despite all these crashes and other issues. Hopefully, with more patches and time, Helldivers 2 will become a more reliable, solid experience.",

        "body": "Mere days after Arrowhead's CEO coyly teased the Heavy Machine Gun, it fell into Helldivers 2 players' collectives laps this morning. And it's not alone. Helldivers 2 got two new Stratagems today: The Heavy Machine Gun and Quasar Cannon.\n\nThe weapons appeared in players' arsenals seemingly to assist them with the current Major Order. Operation Swift Disassembly sicced thousands upon thousands of Helldivers on Automaton-controlled worlds in what is apparently Super Earth's attempt to curtail their expansion toward Cyberstan.\n\nPlayers will find the two new Support Weapons available for purchase in the Stratagem menu on their Super Destroyer ships. The MG-206 Heavy Machine Gun is going for 6,000 Requisition Slips, and you can take the LAS-99 Quasar Cannon home for 7,500. Both boast unlimited uses and a 480-second cooldown time.\n\nThe two weapons are geared toward turning bots into smoldering scrap, but so far players are mostly singing the praises of just one.\n\nThe Quasar Cannon seems to be taking the Helldivers 2 community by storm, and for good reason. Players have been excitedly sharing footage of the laser-based cannon effortlessly swatting Automaton dropships from the skies. The weapon seems to tear through Hulks with only a couple of blasts, and it can even knock down bot Fabricators. The Autocannon and EAT-17 may have finally met their better, and the Railgun will likely fall even lower on the tier list.\n\nOn the other hand, the HMG is proving to be a tough sell. The incredible recoil, along with the lack of a third-person reticle, makes the gun an absolute bear to control when shooting from the hip. Crouching or going prone helps, you need to change to first person for a more accurate shot. But its unwieldy nature and 75-round drum means you have to be careful when blasting enemies.\n\nI took the HMG to Troost and found that pulse firing earned me at least a couple of Berserker kills before I ran out of shots and got swarmed. Changing the firing mode to a lower RPM and hitting the dirt helps but, man, this is a beast of a weapon. I recommend taking an ammo pack because you'll run out before you know it.",

The official X account posted:\n\nThe two new weapons mark a busy week for the studio as Arrowhead published an article looking at the previous patch for the game. Patrik Lasota said \"I'm responsible for how Arrowhead listens to feedback and balances its games. I'd like to talk about the changes we made in this patch and why.\"\n\nLatosa is the Head of Product Testing (HPT) at Arrowhead and was also a designer on the original Helldivers game.\n\nHe broke down the weapons, nerfs, and fantasy and a few of the key supporting pieces that help Helldivers on their missions.\n\n\"All too often in the games industry the core fantasy, and what makes a weapon feel good and fun, is ignored for the sake of Balance,\" Latosa said of finding harmony in the game.\n\nFeedback is incredibly important to the method Arrowhead adopts and can be seen in the HPT's views on game design. \"It is extra important to us to tread carefully so that we don't ruin fantasy and fun when we do nerfs. We hope you, our players, will tell us when we cross that line inadvertently.\"\n\nArrowhead dropped game content earlier this month in the form of the Warbond upgrades. \"Helldivers... we need your help. The brainiacs in Super Earth Research & Development have some cool experimental armor ready to be field-tested. This is where you come in, you're just the right people for the job,\" said the Sony blog post.\n\nThe content drop was well received off the back of a massive update patch that brought fire tornadoes and meteors to the co-op shooter, as well as stabilization and balancing fixes.\n\nArrowhead continues to impress with its player and content-focused updates to the game. We await what is next for the saviors of Super Earth, but knowing the tongue-in-cheek studio they will probably drop a few hints.",

        "title": "'Such a democratic weapon it makes me cry': Helldivers 2 players salute the Quasar Cannon, Super Earth's new heavy armor god gun",
        "body": "It feels like only yesterday that I complained that Helldivers 2 doesn't have enough guns that rule against Automatons. Clearly Arrowhead heard my pleas, because in a surprise update this morning, two new support weapons arrived in the Super Earth arsenal: the MG-101 Heavy Machine Gun, and the true talk of the town, LAS-99 Quasar Cannon.\n\nThe Quasar Cannon makes a stunning impression. Its boxy, imposing body rests on the shoulder, similar to its distant cousin the Laser Cannon. But unlike laser beam weapons, the Quasar Cannon charges up one huge blast at a time. Mid-charge, the cannon's reticle spins as its internal mechanism whirs with anticipation. A concentrated ball of energy gathers at the end of the barrel, then releases with an understated zap followed immediately by a bassy impact. It's a mean machine, and I'm glad it's on our side.\n\nUnlocked at level 18 for 7,500 Reqs, the Quasar doesn't have to reload, but has a sizable cooldown between shots. Not that whatever you just hit will still be standing -- early testing suggests a single quasar blast is about as powerful as an anti-tank rocket, but with a few key advantages:\n\nThe Helldivers 2 community is welcoming the Quasar Cannon with open arms and clenched fists. Far and wide, players are sharing their early impressions of the support weapon, pointing out its one-shot-kill potential against Hulks, Chargers, fabricators, and even Automaton dropships. One top-upvoted post on the Helldivers subreddit by user The_Bored_Goat doesn't hold back the Quasar love:\n\n\"Best Weapon in the game. It's an EAT with infinite ammo, it performs just as well as the EAT damage-wise, doesn't have a reload animation, and has infinite range,\" they wrote. \"Such a democratic weapon it makes me cry.\"\n\nWhile superlatives are premature, the Quasar Cannon does slot nicely into a small club of weapons that can challenge Helldivers 2's strongest threats. Its raw damage and armor-piercing potential remind me of the pre-nerf Railgun that could bore out the center of Chargers and Hulks in a flash. What makes the Quasar so good against bots, specifically, is its precision -- as demonstrated by user Carbo-Hydrates-0417, the cannon can accurately snipe fabricators, bug holes, and other destructible structures from any distance.\n\nFirst time trying the quasar cannon against a fabricator, this thing can snipe from r/Helldivers\n\nBut, the Quasar has its share of downsides. Its long three-to-four second charge up time means you really have to know what you want to shoot ahead of time. It's not a \"fire and forget\" affair like the Expendable Anti-Tank, and if you're accustomed to blowing the head off a Charger seconds before it clobbers you, the Quasar might let you down. Unlimited ammo is nice, but the cooldown between shots is around the same, if not longer, than a Recoiless Rifle reload. You could also choose to see the Quasar's lack of a backpack as a weakness -- a Recoiless Rifle or Autocannon with a tag-team reload can fire way faster than the Quasar.\n\nQuasar blasts don't have much splash damage either -- despite sharing a form factor with rocket launchers, it's more accurate to think of this as a precision rifle.\n\nI love the Laser-99 Quasar Cannon! from r/Helldivers\n\nI'll leave with some helpful Quasar Cannon testing data gathered by user Emptynesz to give you an idea of how it can be useful not just for killing stuff, but clearing objectives:",

        "body": "Video Gamer is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Prices subject to change. Learn more\n\nI have often pondered the question: \"Do the bad guys know that they're the bad guys, or do they believe they're good?\" Looking through history, we do know that there are examples of this being true. But, rather than revisiting some of the atrocities that have taken place throughout human history, let's take a look at a franchise such as Star Wars. Does Palpatine, Darth Vader, or any other Sith know they are evil or are they the good guys in their own narrative?\n\nPalpatine may have known he was evil because he had very few redeeming qualities, but Anakin Skywalker did believe he was committing his evil deeds in the name of good, telling Padme on Mustafar in Revenge of the Sith that he had \"brought peace to the Republic.\" There have been times that I have thought I was alone in this train of thought, but it turns out I'm not as even Helldivers 2 players have begun to question whether the Helldivers are the good guys in this game.\n\nIn a post on Reddit, Helldivers 2 players discussed how terrifying the Helldivers must be to the Terminids and that it is difficult to blame them for attacking and fighting back. U/PikachuFan2222 noted how \"anywhere from 1-20 guys just show up, slaughter 100s of their troops, destroy several key infrastructure points, and leave in under 40 minutes.\" When you think of a mission in this way, it is hard to disagree with. It is said that the Terminids have an \"instinctive urge to reproduce, spread, and destroy democracy,\" which makes them sound evil. But, the Terminids only became a threat after killing civilians on Super Earth after being held captive in specialised farms, so who can blame them for being annoyed with the human race?\n\nOn the other hand, the same can't be said for the robots in the game, the Automatons, who have been created to be bloodthirsty with one goal and that is to destroy the Helldivers and Super Earth. Corpses of Terminids can also be found on planets that the Automatons occupy, showing that the robot's only goal is to destroy all natural life forms. So, the next time you jump into Helldivers 2, take a moment to consider what role you're playing and whether you are killing for the greater good or whether you're being manipulated by Super Earth, unless you're fighting the Automaton, in which case just go all out and destroy those robots without mercy.\n\nWhile you ponder over this new perspective and your role in this ongoing war, we recommend checking out our Helldivers 2 best weapons guide and best armor guides to help you create the best loadout for your Helldiver so you can eradicate an entire species in the most efficient way possible.",

Learn more\n\nHelldivers 2 has seen a steady flow of updates which has kept players coming back to the game regularly to take on the Terminids and Automatons, as well as helping the game achieve over eight million sales in just two months. But, with the threat of The Illuminate on the horizon, the Helldivers are getting access to even more firepower to eradicate everyone that is a threat to Super Earth.\n\nArrowhead Game Studios has announced on X that two new weapons have been added to Helldivers 2 as part of the latest update. This has been added as a hotfix and can be used immediately. The two weapons that have been added are the LAS-99 Quasar Cannon and the MG-101 Heavy Machine Gun. A new Machine Gun has been heavily requested by the community so the MG-101 will likely be heavily used over the next few days. When it comes to support weapons, there are many options to choose one, so it will be interesting to see how the LAS-99 holds up.\n\nThe X post mentions using the two new weapons against the Automatons, which means that these weapons have been added as a way to encourage players to complete missions on the planets occupied by the robots. Over the past month there has been a huge increase in the Terminids being favored over the Automatons due to the robots having overpowered weapons which can one shot players and even shoot through cover, making the missions unappealing. But with two factions to fight, Arrowhead Game Studios may be looking to add more story elements featuring the robots after the last few Major Orders focused on Terminids.\n\nIt is unclear yet how the new LAS-99 and MG-101 will fit into the meta, there are already many great options to use as part of your loadout.

The extensive document reveals Washington's priorities in instituting online censorship and combating so-called \"fake news\" in the post-Trump, post-Brexit era.But \"much of the organization's focus appears to be on preventing individuals from finding information online that challenges official narratives and leads to increased questioning of the system more generally,\" says journalist Alan MacLeod in an analysis published by MintPress News.Anthropologist Adrienne Pine joined Sputnik's Political Misfits program Thursday to discuss the article and shed light on one of the United States' most underhanded tools of global subversion.\"USAID's focus relates to \"misinformation, disinformation and mal-information,\" notes host Michelle Witte, referring to terms which are employed frequently by so-called experts in the field. \"Malinformation\" has proven to be perhaps the most controversial among the three, referring to factually true information presented in a way to allegedly harm or manipulate.Malinformation may lead people towards inconvenient narratives for those in power such as the conclusion that Israeli ethnic cleansing is bad or the Iraq War wasn't about \"spreading democracy.\"\"Experts have described this phenomenon as an information disorder, a condition in which the truth and facts coexist in a milieu of misinformation and disinformation - like conspiracy theories, lies, propaganda and half-truths,\" explained Witte. \"Which I will stop and say describes every press briefing by a White House press secretary or John Kirby for the State Department or whoever.\"The tactic was recently employed by establishment mouthpiece The New York Times in an article about the anti-war group Code Pink that was widely slammed as McCarthyist in its tone. McCarthyism refers to disgraced former US Senator Joseph McCarthy's Cold War tactic of smearing opponents by accusing them of association with communism or Soviet Russia.Pine explained the Cold War origins of USAID as a tool of US \"soft power.\" The organization was created around the same time as other government agencies such as the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress, \"a US imperialist program aimed at preventing revolutions in Latin America,\" she noted.USAID operates by funding \"civil society\" groups purportedly focused on \"democracy promotion,\" labor rights, strengthening \"independent media,\" and other anodyne causes. But covert influence, as well as such groups' desire to maintain US funding, transforms them into tools of US foreign policy.Such non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can play a role in strengthening opposition to movements and figures perceived to work against US interests. In more extreme cases these groups promote civil unrest that creates a fertile environment for US-backed regime change. These efforts are known as \"color revolutions\" and have taken place in such countries as Bolivia in 2019 and Ukraine in 2004 and 2014.Witte slammed the \"hypocrisy\" of the tactic given the US fixation on the conspiracy theory that Russia altered the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The host called USAID's efforts \"profoundly anti-democratic, because it's the notion that the United States can fund organizations that are against governments that the United States doesn't like, in lieu of the democratic processes that those governments and those people would like to set up.\"Pine noted the USAID document, in addition to smearing alternative news outlets like the Ron Paul Institute, Black Agenda Report and Truthout, also attempts to promote US intelligence-linked sources like the Atlantic Council and Bellingcat.The Atlantic Council is a NATO offshoot created by the US defense department, MacLeod's article notes, with seven former CIA chiefs on its board. Bellingcat, which presents itself as an independent \"open source\" intelligence operation, receives grants from the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and other Western government agencies.",

        "title": "Power also destroys science. Lichocka about the fact that barbarians take no prisoners",
        "body": "Examples of barbaric acts characterized by complete ignorance and contempt for intellectual work Liquidation of the Republican Institute - Established by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to promote research in the field of Polish humanities and social sciences. The Institute was a state-governmental institution working to implement republican assumptions of state development - Polish state history, philosophy and legal science through analytical publications and conferences, as well as to diagnose a situation - I will put it in more than one place. General Terms - Polish Spirit and Identity. All this was and still is the need of the hour. Established humanities institutes and universities avoid such topics, and the leading idea in academia is to deconstruct the Polish myth and extract or even create black spots in the history of our country.\n\nTherefore, the establishment of the Republican Institute in February 2021, the aim of which was to promote Polish humanities, was absolutely necessary from the point of view of the country's interests. It is precisely for these reasons that the institute was liquidated by the government of Donald Tusk. To provide an excuse for this, Donald Tusk and Jan Grabec fabricated a lot of accusations against the Institute in press conferences, based on half-truths and manipulation, which arose after the politicized audit of the Supreme Audit Office, which was carried out after 6 months of the Institute's work. Activities have begun. Most of them were examined, clarified and reformed by the previous government, but this fact was ignored.\n\nIt is worth doing justice to the employees of the institute who today face an incredible industry of contempt - here are examples of the activities of the institutions that Donald Tusk is hiding. In this short period, 107 books were prepared and printed. The publishing plan in the near future included approximately 90 articles. The institute's publications have been appreciated by the scientific world, receiving 7 awards and honors, 3 nominations in prestigious literary competitions, as well as rave reviews in the media. In 2023, for example, a monumental three-volume work on the Polish emblem \"White Eagle\" will be published. History of the Coat of Arms of Poland\", \"The Great War (1914-1918) on Polish soil\". \"Memory and Women's Letters\" and \"Vistula Gulag\". Communist labor camps in Poland 1944-1956. More than 100 national and international scientific events were organised. Participated It includes scholars from academic centers from Poland, Germany, Ukraine, Spain, Italy and Bulgaria. The \"Joseph Conrad Fellowship\" scholarship program was established, and its aim was to create a space for discussion on important contemporary problems and challenges of the humanities. Starting in 2022, the Institute will award awards for distinguished scholarly achievements to scholars Those under 40 years of age who have at least a Ph. D. This should also include: holding competitions for young people, organizing educational exhibitions and disseminating knowledge about Polish inventors and scientists in social media and on the Internet.\n\nThe institute's liquidator was Edita Szostak, Director General of the Prime Minister's Chancellery, on whose behalf Halina Temczyzin de facto carries out activities. Pawe\u0142 Gotowiec, a musicologist in his 20s from Bydgoszcz, was also appointed to help her, saying he was \"from the minister\". inIt is worth remembering these names - the barbarian authorities use specific people. Since there are still a few allegations that justify the liquidation of the institute, since January it has been subject to a comprehensive inspection by the Supreme Audit Office in consultation with the Prime Minister's Chancellery. Everything that can be destroyed is destroyed. More books scheduled to be published in the coming weeks have been withdrawn from the press. Those who are in the process of preparing for printing are prohibited from continuing to work on it. This includes: Publications: \"Terrorism rages. The first months of the German occupation in Gda\u0144sk Pomerania\"; \"The Duchy of Warsaw: a leap into modernity\"; \"The First Partition of Poland in Light of Latest Research\". Sending items like: \"Jan Zamoyski\" to the printing house. \"Times - People - Politics\"; \"The Jesuits. Science, Culture and Spirituality\"; \"Tadeusz Skowronski. About a Polish diplomat in Brazil.\n\nIn addition, there is a host of contempt and mistreatment of employees. The liquidators must address them as \"lazy, exploited and unemployed persons\". The institute's employees do not know the timeline for liquidating the facility, nor do they know how long they will work for it.\n\nIn this case, you can find out what level the December 13 team represents. But I have a question that is not for them, there is nothing to talk about with the barbarians. I ask everyone who cooperated with the Republican Institute: Why are you sitting like mice under a broom? After all, silence means consent.",

        "title": "Persistent rumor of Putin's death elicits nonchalant international response - WTOP News",
        "body": "For months, rumors have swirled about Russian President Vladimir Putin. At the heart of all the gossip is a key question: is he still alive?\n\nFor months, rumors have swirled about Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA claim by a mysterious Russian Telegram channel called General SVR, run by a prominent Russian political analyst, triggered a cascade of international news stories and social media posts in October of 2023.\n\nAccording to the channel, Putin suffered a cardiac arrest and died Thursday, Oct. 26 at 8:42 p.m.\n\nValery Solovei, widely known for his criticism of the Kremlin, is believed to be \"General SVR.\" He's predicted many events that never came true. But he nailed one big one Aug. 1, 2016. He said Sergei Ivanov, Vladimir Putin's longtime friend and Chief of Staff, was fired and replaced by Anton Vaino.\n\nEleven days later it was done. Vaino remains Putin's chief of staff today.\n\nConsidering General SVR's sketchy track record, Western media have scrambled, with inconclusive results for months trying to determine if this current, incredible tale is true.\n\nWestern intelligence sources tell WTOP, the events mentioned in the posts are probably not true. And while there may be a grain of truth to the stories about Putin being ill, there is no way -- considering the opaque layers of security around Putin -- to determine the truth.\n\nLiving the in the era of artificial intelligence and deepfakes, it's not difficult to imagine the complexity involved in producing proof of Putin's physical status.\n\nBut the most stunning element of this story, which adds to the mystery, is that prominent officials say it really doesn't matter if he's alive or not -- he's done what he set out to do.\n\n\"I do not care whether he is dead or alive,\" said Eeva Eek-Pajuste, police adviser at Estonia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nStressing that her comments are \"my own thoughts and not those of the Ministry,\" she said it's all about optics.\n\n\"If Putin's legacy is alive and he appears to be alive in public, then it makes no difference whether it is this Putin or some other Putin who people see,\" said Eek-Pajuste.\n\nPutin's 24 years in power have been dominated by long jail terms for Kremlin critics, brutal assassinations of political opponents, and a gradually declining global economic profile for Russia. His rhetoric demonizing Western nations, NATO and neighbors that support Western values are viewed as parts of a possible strategy to reconstitute the Soviet Union.\n\nThe most flagrant example of his alleged plan has been the two-year war against Ukraine, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and almost a half million Russian troops.\n\nPutin, who on March 18 secured a fifth term as president, is often blamed for everything that happens in Russia because of his iron-fisted grip on power.\n\nThus, reports of his death might, to some, signal an end to the era of fear he's presided over.\n\nBut Eek-Pajuste, who has a long, distinguished history with the government of Estonia, suggested that is far from the truth. She said Putin may just be the avatar of a much larger Russian entity representing, to the dismay of Western Putin critics, the very complex reality of life inside Russia.\n\n\"Democracy for Russians means something totally different than it does for those who live in Western countries,\" Eek-Pajuste said.\n\n\"For Russians,\" she said, \"democracy is the awful time in the beginning of the 1990s when there were no rules regarding money, and life in Russia was close to anarchy.\"\n\nIn 1991, Russia -- after the USSR lost the 45-year Cold War with the West, which championed democracy -- was catapulted into a period akin to the Gold Rush in the American West in the mid-1800s.\n\nIt was a free-for-all.\n\nRussia was swept up by governmental power grabs, surges of theft and murder, industry privatization, the emergence of rejuvenated and powerful spy agencies, and the rise of a new president with deep roots in the KGB.\n\nPutin managed to melt all of the chaos into a machine that ratcheted his wealth up from that of a midlevel government official to a figure estimated to be close to $250 billion.\n\nThat machine, according to a key Ukrainian military adviser, is just as much to blame for the Kremlin's activities as Putin is.\n\n\"Putin is not all of Russia, OK,\" said Yuriy Sak, adviser to Ukraine's Minister of Strategic Industries.\n\n\"It's not really correct to sort of blame everything that is happening on Putin alone and to think that if Putin goes or stays that it will have any considerable impact.\"\n\nSak pointed to the recent election as an example.\n\n\"Russia is a terrorist state, because 87% of their population apparently voted for him, endorsing terrorism, which makes them also complicit in terrorism,\" Sak said.\n\nHe said regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, Russians who support Putin also bear the blame for the state of the country and its actions abroad.\n\n\"If Putin goes tomorrow -- if he dies or is abducted by aliens, there will still be millions and millions of Russians who are war criminals in their hearts and minds,\" Sak said.\n\nThe shadowy claim that Putin is dead and is being replaced by look-alikes has generated such a response inside Russia that the government was forced to address it. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's chief spokesman, called the death rumors an \"absurd information fake.\"\n\nBut in Russia, where disinformation flourishes and is even utilized by the Kremlin to achieve its internal and geopolitical goals, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, even the Kremlin's denial of Putin's death is suspect.\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

Freighter pilot called for tugboat help before plowing into Baltimore bridge The pilot of the cargo freighter that knocked down a highway bridge into Baltimore Harbor had radioed for tugboat help and reported a power loss minutes earlier, federal safety officials said on Wednesday, citing audio from the ship's \"black box\" data recorder.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current world news briefs.\n\nCaught up in concert shooting, a Russian woman said goodbye to the world\n\nRussian artist Alyona Kazinskaya likes to fill her social media feed with cheerful messages and vivid floral paintings. For 30 minutes last Friday night, it turned into a timeline of terror. Kazinskaya and a friend had bought last-minute tickets to see Soviet-era rock group \"Picnic\" perform in front of 6,200 people at a concert hall near Moscow. They thought about taking their daughters but decided to go by themselves.\n\nZelenskiy tells US House speaker: Quick passage of military aid is vital\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday that it was vital for Congress to pass a new military aid package for Kyiv rapidly in order to maintain international unity on the conflict with Russia. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has held up a bill for months that would supply $60 billion in military and financial aid for Ukraine.\n\nIsraeli soldiers play with Gaza women's underwear in online posts\n\nIsraeli soldiers have been posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the war in Gaza as a looming famine intensifies world scrutiny of Israel's offensive.\n\nIn one video, an Israeli soldier sits in an armchair in a room in Gaza grinning, with a gun in one hand and dangling white satin underwear from the other over the open mouth of a comrade lying on a sofa.\n\nWorld Court orders Israel to halt Gaza famine; Hamas says ceasefire needed\n\nThe World Court on Thursday unanimously ordered Israel, accused by South Africa of genocide in Gaza, to take all necessary and effective action to ensure basic food supplies to the enclave's Palestinian population and halt spreading famine.

The decades-old controversy has become especially sensitive as Israel's armed forces, made up mostly of teenaged conscripts and older civilians mobilised for reserve duty, wage a nearly six-month-old war in Gaza to try to eliminate the Islamist Hamas movement that rules the Palestinian enclave.\n\nFreighter pilot called for tugboat help before plowing into Baltimore bridge\n\nThe pilot of the cargo freighter that knocked down a highway bridge into Baltimore Harbor had radioed for tugboat help and reported a power loss minutes earlier, federal safety officials said on Wednesday, citing audio from the ship's \"black box\" data recorder. The head of the National Transportation Safety Board also said that Francis Scott Key Bridge, a traffic artery over the harbor built in 1976, lacked structural engineering redundancies common to newer spans, making it more vulnerable to a catastrophic collapse.\n\nSouth Africa bus crash kills 45 Easter pilgrims, Transport Ministry says\n\nA bus crash in South Africa's northern province of Limpopo resulted in 45 deaths and one serious injury, South Africa's Department of Transport said on Thursday.

Russia has said from the outset that it believes Ukraine was linked to the attack, even though Kyiv has denied it and the militant group Islamic State has claimed responsibility.\n\nUS urges UN Security Council action to get aid into Sudan from Chad\n\nThe United States warned on Thursday that it would push the U.N. Security Council to take action to get aid to starving people in Sudan, possibly by authorizing cross-border deliveries from Chad, if the Sudanese armed forces do not restore full access. Ahead of the one year anniversary of the conflict in Sudan, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the warring parties had both undermined aid operations and ignored a Security Council call for an immediate cessation of hostilities.\n\nDozens of stalled Israeli visas seen hindering Gaza aid efforts\n\nDifficulties getting Israeli permission for foreign staff to work in Israel and the Palestinian territories are hampering efforts to get aid into war-shattered Gaza where civilians are facing imminent famine, according to U.N. data and aid workers. Six aid workers from the U.N. and other groups interviewed by Reuters cited delays to visas as an example of red tape they say is thwarting aid to Gaza, nearly six months into Israel's offensive against Hamas militants.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

This is the only way we can win. It was one of our most emotional games.\n\n\"It is an amazing feeling. I am very happy because it is another dream come true. A big thank you to our fans, they helped us through these difficult times amazingly.\"\n\nCoach Serhiy Rebrov said in the build-up to the Iceland match that it was hard for his team to concentrate on football.\n\n\"The missiles are flying every day. Our mission is to show that we're all alive and fighting against the Russians and that we need Europe's support,\" Rebrov said.\n\nHe added that his players were \"watching the news about the shelling of Odessa and Kyiv (and made) even more angry and eager to show our potential on the football field\".\n\nUkraine players celebrate with their fans after qualifying for the Euro 2024 finals in Germany. -- AFP\n\nThe coach hailed the \"character of our players and our nation\" to keep going in a qualifying campaign where, as refugees from the war themselves, Ukraine have staged 'home' matches spread across Europe.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the team's resilience in difficult times.\n\n\"Thank you, team. For the important victory and making it to Euro,\" Zelenskiy said in a post on X.\n\n\"For proving once again, whenever Ukrainians face difficulties they do not give up and continue to fight, Ukrainians certainly win.\n\n\"In times, when the enemy tries to destroy us, we demonstrate every day that Ukrainians are and will be. Ukraine is, and will be! Glory to Ukraine!\"\n\nUkraine successfully completed their qualification mission in Poland, which has the largest concentration of Ukrainian refugees of any country.\n\nStill, it has been no easy path to the finals.\n\nRebrov's side came through a tough qualifying group that included European champions Italy and runners-up England, managing draws against both sides.\n\nIt followed the disappointment of losing to Wales in a playoff for a place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, after which former Ukraine striker Rebrov took over in June last year.\n\nJubilant Ukraine fans at the Stadion Miejski Wroclaw in Poland. -- Reuters\n\nWith Roman Yaremchuk and Artem Dovbyk in attack, the pace of winger Mykhailo Mudryk, guile of Zinchenko in midfield and steel of Illya Zabarnyi and Vitaliy Mykolenko at the back, Ukraine have a capable squad.\n\nWhat they have proven now is that they can battle against the odds in the face of adversity and win the day, hoping that will become a unifying message for the country.\n\n\"It was very difficult to be on the coaching bench today, I saw how difficult it was for the guys,\" Rebrov said.\n\n\"I am grateful to all of them for this gift for our country. In such a difficult time, it is very important.\" -- Reuters",

        "body": "Constantly In Touch With Russian Authorities: MEA On Indian Nationals Seeking Discharge From Russian Army Thursday, March 28, 2024 by Indian Defence News\n\nNew Delhi: India is constantly in touch with Russian authorities to have Indian nationals released and discharged from the Russian army as early as possible, Ministry of External Affairs official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a press briefing on Thursday.\n\nAsked about update on Indians who were duped by agents and sent to Russia to join the military, Randhir Jaiswal stated, \"Regarding Russia, as I told you earlier also, we are constantly in touch with Russian authorities. We have taken it up strongly for them to have our nationals released and discharged as early as possible.\"\n\n\"I will have an update for you, and as and when I have an update for you, I will keep you informed. On the death toll, we know last time also I had told you that two people have passed away. Their mortal remains have come to India. and have been sent to their family members. So, the death toll is where two people had passed away, died in the conflict,\" he added.\n\nNotably, at least two Indians have died while serving in the Russian army against Ukraine, as around 20 others were allegedly duped into fighting in Russia's war with Ukraine on the pretext of lucrative jobs.\n\nRecently, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), busted a major human trafficking network running across the country targeting Indian nationals on the promise of offering lucrative jobs abroad but allegedly sending them to the Russia-Ukraine war zone. The central agency is conducting simultaneous searches at around 13 locations in Delhi, Trivandrum, Mumbai, Ambala, Chandigarh, Madurai and Chennai.\n\nThe CBI stated that these traffickers have been operating as an organised network and were luring Indian nationals through social media channels like YouTube, etc and also through their local contacts/agents for highly paid jobs in Russia.\n\nThereafter, the trafficked Indian nationals were trained in combat roles and deployed at front bases in the Russia-Ukraine War zone against their wishes, thus, putting their lives in grave danger. It has been ascertained that some of the victims were also grievously injured in the war zone.Certain suspects have also been detained for questioning at various locations.\n\nSo far, around 35 instances of victims sent abroad have been established. The identity of more trafficking victims is also being established. The investigation is still underway. Meanwhile, an appeal has been made to the general public not to fall prey to such false promises of jobs by dubious recruitment agencies and agents.\n\nThis report is auto-generated from a syndicated feed\n\nComments",

        "body": "As many as 143 people are still missing after last week's attack near Moscow when gunmen sprayed concertgoers with automatic weapons and set the venue on fire, a Russian state news outlet reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe official toll from the attack on Crocus City Hall now stands at 140 dead and 182 wounded. But the state Tass news agency quoted Russia's Investigative Committee as saying that 143 more people appeared in lists compiled by the emergency services based on appeals from people about missing relatives.\n\nIn addition, the Investigative Committee said 84 bodies had been identified, including the bodies of five children.\n\n\"Molecular genetic tests are being conducted to establish the identities of the rest of the dead people,\" the committee said.\n\nMaria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children's rights, presented an award on Tuesday to a 15-year-old boy who saved more than 100 people during the attack.\n\nThe teenager worked part-time at the Crocus City Hall concert venue as a cloakroom attendant and was on duty when the shooting occurred.\n\nThe boy saw people panicking. He loudly announced that he was an employee, he knew where the exits were, and pointed the way out.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that it was \"extremely hard to believe\" that Islamic State would have had the capacity to launch the attack.\n\nAt a briefing with reporters, Zakharova instead doubled down on Moscow's assertions, for which it has not yet provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack on the Crocus City Hall, the deadliest Russia has suffered in 20 years.\n\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for the massacre and United States officials said they have intelligence showing it was carried out by the network's Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan. Ukraine has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack.\n\nBut Zakharova said the West had rushed to pin responsibility on Islamic State as a way of deflecting blame from Ukraine and the Western governments that support it.\n\n\"In order to ward off suspicions from the collective West, they urgently needed to come up with something, so they resorted to ISIS, pulled an ace out of their sleeve, and literally a few hours after the terrorist attack, the Anglo-Saxon media began disseminating precisely these versions,\" she said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said earlier the attack was carried out by extremists, but has suggested it was to Ukraine's benefit and that Kyiv may have played a role.\n\nMeanwhile, in remarks to Russian air force pilots on Wednesday, Putin said Russia has no designs on any NATO country and will not attack Poland, the Baltic states or the Czech Republic. But if the West supplies F-16 fighters to Ukraine, they will be shot down by Russian forces.\n\nPutin said the US-led military alliance had expanded eastward toward Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, but that Moscow had no plans to attack a NATO state.\n\n\"We have no aggressive intentions toward these states,\" Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript released on Thursday.\n\nPutin said the F-16 could also carry nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Of course, if they will be used from airfields in third countries, they become for us legitimate targets, wherever they might be located,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin's remarks followed comments earlier in the day by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that the aircraft should arrive in Ukraine in the coming months.\n\nUkraine has sought F-16s for many months. Belgium, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands are among countries that have pledged to donate F-16s. A coalition of countries has promised to help train Ukrainian pilots in their use.",

        "body": "If these reports are confirmed, the main question that arises is: How could a spy camera be installed in such a place, and the recordings from it be quickly transferred to accounts that spread Russian propaganda?\n\nAccording to Ukrainian media, there is likely a hidden camera in the office of the main military commissar of Rivne, Oleksandr Yarmoshevich.\n\nScandal in movies. Services are conducting the investigation\n\nVideos posted online show how, in the privacy of the office and against the backdrop of sacred paintings, the officer indulges in an exchange of tenderness with women. In one clip, he appears hugging and kissing a blonde woman, and in another, he shows similar affection for a red-haired soldier wearing a military uniform. These intimate moments, captured on camera, caused a sensation in Ukraine and a reaction from state agencies. They examine the authenticity of the recordings and the context of their creation.\n\nAs Ukrainian media reported, the videos were first shared by Russian preacher Anatoly Shari. He is apparently currently in Spain, and the Ukrainian Security Service (Ukraine's main national security service) suspects that he has betrayed his homeland.\n\nIt is not yet known where the Russian agents obtained the recording from the Office of the Main Military Commissar. This is the basic question investigators ask themselves.\n\nIt could be the commissioner\n\nUkrainian media admit that the man in the recording resembles the chief commissioner.\n\nCurrently, the Ukrainian Ground Forces, to which all military commissars are subordinate, have responded to this scandal.\n\n- A video showing the head of one of the regional conscription and social support centers in the Rivne region is published on the Internet from anti-Ukrainian sources. An official investigation has begun into the published video, the ground forces reported via the Telegram application.\n\nSee also:\n\nA dramatic accident in the quarry.

        "title": "Persistent rumor of Putin's death elicits nonchalant international response - WTOP News",
        "body": "For months, rumors have swirled about Russian President Vladimir Putin. At the heart of all the gossip is a key question: is he still alive?\n\nFor months, rumors have swirled about Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA claim by a mysterious Russian Telegram channel called General SVR, run by a prominent Russian political analyst, triggered a cascade of international news stories and social media posts in October of 2023.\n\nAccording to the channel, Putin suffered a cardiac arrest and died Thursday, Oct. 26 at 8:42 p.m.\n\nValery Solovei, widely known for his criticism of the Kremlin, is believed to be \"General SVR.\" He's predicted many events that never came true. But he nailed one big one Aug. 1, 2016. He said Sergei Ivanov, Vladimir Putin's longtime friend and Chief of Staff, was fired and replaced by Anton Vaino.\n\nEleven days later it was done. Vaino remains Putin's chief of staff today.\n\nConsidering General SVR's sketchy track record, Western media have scrambled, with inconclusive results for months trying to determine if this current, incredible tale is true.\n\nWestern intelligence sources tell WTOP, the events mentioned in the posts are probably not true. And while there may be a grain of truth to the stories about Putin being ill, there is no way -- considering the opaque layers of security around Putin -- to determine the truth.\n\nLiving the in the era of artificial intelligence and deepfakes, it's not difficult to imagine the complexity involved in producing proof of Putin's physical status.\n\nBut the most stunning element of this story, which adds to the mystery, is that prominent officials say it really doesn't matter if he's alive or not -- he's done what he set out to do.\n\n\"I do not care whether he is dead or alive,\" said Eeva Eek-Pajuste, police adviser at Estonia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nStressing that her comments are \"my own thoughts and not those of the Ministry,\" she said it's all about optics.\n\n\"If Putin's legacy is alive and he appears to be alive in public, then it makes no difference whether it is this Putin or some other Putin who people see,\" said Eek-Pajuste.\n\nPutin's 24 years in power have been dominated by long jail terms for Kremlin critics, brutal assassinations of political opponents, and a gradually declining global economic profile for Russia. His rhetoric demonizing Western nations, NATO and neighbors that support Western values are viewed as parts of a possible strategy to reconstitute the Soviet Union.\n\nThe most flagrant example of his alleged plan has been the two-year war against Ukraine, which has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and almost a half million Russian troops.\n\nPutin, who on March 18 secured a fifth term as president, is often blamed for everything that happens in Russia because of his iron-fisted grip on power.\n\nThus, reports of his death might, to some, signal an end to the era of fear he's presided over.\n\nBut Eek-Pajuste, who has a long, distinguished history with the government of Estonia, suggested that is far from the truth. She said Putin may just be the avatar of a much larger Russian entity representing, to the dismay of Western Putin critics, the very complex reality of life inside Russia.\n\n\"Democracy for Russians means something totally different than it does for those who live in Western countries,\" Eek-Pajuste said.\n\n\"For Russians,\" she said, \"democracy is the awful time in the beginning of the 1990s when there were no rules regarding money, and life in Russia was close to anarchy.\"\n\nIn 1991, Russia -- after the USSR lost the 45-year Cold War with the West, which championed democracy -- was catapulted into a period akin to the Gold Rush in the American West in the mid-1800s.\n\nIt was a free-for-all.\n\nRussia was swept up by governmental power grabs, surges of theft and murder, industry privatization, the emergence of rejuvenated and powerful spy agencies, and the rise of a new president with deep roots in the KGB.\n\nPutin managed to melt all of the chaos into a machine that ratcheted his wealth up from that of a midlevel government official to a figure estimated to be close to $250 billion.\n\nThat machine, according to a key Ukrainian military adviser, is just as much to blame for the Kremlin's activities as Putin is.\n\n\"Putin is not all of Russia, OK,\" said Yuriy Sak, adviser to Ukraine's Minister of Strategic Industries.\n\n\"It's not really correct to sort of blame everything that is happening on Putin alone and to think that if Putin goes or stays that it will have any considerable impact.\"\n\nSak pointed to the recent election as an example.\n\n\"Russia is a terrorist state, because 87% of their population apparently voted for him, endorsing terrorism, which makes them also complicit in terrorism,\" Sak said.\n\nHe said regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, Russians who support Putin also bear the blame for the state of the country and its actions abroad.\n\n\"If Putin goes tomorrow -- if he dies or is abducted by aliens, there will still be millions and millions of Russians who are war criminals in their hearts and minds,\" Sak said.\n\nThe shadowy claim that Putin is dead and is being replaced by look-alikes has generated such a response inside Russia that the government was forced to address it. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's chief spokesman, called the death rumors an \"absurd information fake.\"\n\nBut in Russia, where disinformation flourishes and is even utilized by the Kremlin to achieve its internal and geopolitical goals, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, even the Kremlin's denial of Putin's death is suspect.\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

        "title": "'143 people still missing' after Moscow attack",
        "body": "As many as 143 people are still missing after last week's attack near Moscow when gunmen sprayed concertgoers with automatic weapons and set the venue on fire, a Russian state news outlet reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe official toll from the attack on Crocus City Hall now stands at 140 dead and 182 wounded. But the state Tass news agency quoted Russia's Investigative Committee as saying that 143 more people appeared in lists compiled by the emergency services based on appeals from people about missing relatives.\n\nIn addition, the Investigative Committee said 84 bodies had been identified, including the bodies of five children.\n\n\"Molecular genetic tests are being conducted to establish the identities of the rest of the dead people,\" the committee said.\n\nMaria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children's rights, presented an award on Tuesday to a 15-year-old boy who saved more than 100 people during the attack.\n\nThe teenager worked part-time at the Crocus City Hall concert venue as a cloakroom attendant and was on duty when the shooting occurred.\n\nThe boy saw people panicking. He loudly announced that he was an employee, he knew where the exits were, and pointed the way out.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that it was \"extremely hard to believe\" that Islamic State would have had the capacity to launch the attack.\n\nAt a briefing with reporters, Zakharova instead doubled down on Moscow's assertions, for which it has not yet provided evidence, that Ukraine was behind the attack on the Crocus City Hall, the deadliest Russia has suffered in 20 years.\n\nIslamic State has claimed responsibility for the massacre and United States officials said they have intelligence showing it was carried out by the network's Afghan branch, Islamic State Khorasan. Ukraine has repeatedly denied it had anything to do with the attack.\n\nBut Zakharova said the West had rushed to pin responsibility on Islamic State as a way of deflecting blame from Ukraine and the Western governments that support it.\n\n\"In order to ward off suspicions from the collective West, they urgently needed to come up with something, so they resorted to ISIS, pulled an ace out of their sleeve, and literally a few hours after the terrorist attack, the Anglo-Saxon media began disseminating precisely these versions,\" she said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said earlier the attack was carried out by extremists, but has suggested it was to Ukraine's benefit and that Kyiv may have played a role.\n\nMeanwhile, in remarks to Russian air force pilots on Wednesday, Putin said Russia has no designs on any NATO country and will not attack Poland, the Baltic states or the Czech Republic. But if the West supplies F-16 fighters to Ukraine, they will be shot down by Russian forces.\n\nPutin said the US-led military alliance had expanded eastward toward Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, but that Moscow had no plans to attack a NATO state.\n\n\"We have no aggressive intentions toward these states,\" Putin said, according to a Kremlin transcript released on Thursday.\n\nPutin said the F-16 could also carry nuclear weapons.\n\n\"Of course, if they will be used from airfields in third countries, they become for us legitimate targets, wherever they might be located,\" Putin said.\n\nPutin's remarks followed comments earlier in the day by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that the aircraft should arrive in Ukraine in the coming months.\n\nUkraine has sought F-16s for many months. Belgium, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands are among countries that have pledged to donate F-16s. A coalition of countries has promised to help train Ukrainian pilots in their use.",

        "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that any Western air base hosting U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets earmarked for Ukraine were legitimate targets for Russian air strikes, the AP reported, while he paradoxically ridiculed Western concerns that Moscow would attack NATO countries.\n\n\"Their statements about our alleged intention to attack Europe after Ukraine is sheer nonsense,\" Putin said late Wednesday, in response to Western worries that his invasion of Ukraine could spill over beyond Ukraine's borders.\n\nAdmitting that NATO, in his estimation, has a military budget of more than 10 times that of Russia, while at the same time not excluding the possibility of strikes on European airbases, Putin said that the idea that the Kremlin plans to instigate a broader war with the NATO amounts to mere sound and fury from Western actors.\n\n\"In view of that, are we going to wage a war against NATO? It's ravings,\" he was quoted by the AP as saying to military pilots during a visit to an air base.\n\nSeveral NATO members have promised F-16s and other US-made aircraft to Kyiv, and training of Ukrainian pilots is already underway in Romania and elsewhere in the West. What is less clear is how many Ukrainian airfield runways and bomb-proof hangars can accommodate these jets, and any that can would certainly be Russian targets as well.\n\n\"F-16s are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, and we will also need to take that into account while organizing our combat operations,\" Putin added.\n\nBoots-on-the-ground bloggers claim Russians downed their own warplane\n\nCiting social media reports on Telegram, state news service Ukrinform reported on Wednesday that Russian forces shot down their own warplane shortly after a takeoff from the Belbek airfield in Crimea.",

        "title": "Russia: Religious Freedom Survey - Analysis",
        "body": "Russia's government seriously violates its freedom of religion and belief obligations, along with interlinked human rights such as the freedoms of expression, association, and assembly. Vladimir Putin has ruled Russia as either President or Prime Minister from 1999, and his rule has been marked by multiple serious human rights violations and the invasions of Georgia and Ukraine.\n\nSerious freedom of religion or belief violations documented by Forum 18 within Russia's internationally recognised borders include but are not limited to:\n\n- \"extremism\"-related criminal prosecutions and jailings of Jehovah's Witnesses and of Muslims who meet to study the works of the late Turkish theologian Said Nursi. Both groups have been outlawed as \"extremist organisations\", but adherents continue to meet without state permission in each other's homes to pray and sing together, study sacred texts, and to discuss shared beliefs;\n\n- eight interlocking consequences related to \"extremism\" investigations and criminal convictions for exercising freedom of religion or belief;\n\n- torture, and impunity for officials suspected of torture;\n\n- prisoners of conscience deprived of Russian citizenship and deported from Russia after their sentence;\n\n- a Federal Wanted List of over 95,000 individuals, including at least 42 individuals facing criminal charges to punish them for exercising freedom of religion or belief or for reporting on violations of this right;\n\n- new specific Criminal Code and Administrative Code penalties for allegedly \"discrediting\" the Russian Armed Forces and \"volunteer formations\" and Criminal Code penalties for spreading alleged \"false information\" about the actions of the Armed Forces, \"volunteer formations\", and state bodies (these are aimed at punishing criticism of Russia's renewed invasion of Ukraine);\n\n- prosecuting, fining, and jailing Russians who protest against the invasion from a religious (and non-religious) perspective;\n\n- no legal or practical provision for alternative civilian service (ACS) during mobilisation, leading to conscientious objectors being sent to fight in Ukraine;\n\n- closing the SOVA Center for Information and Analysis for holding events outside Moscow.\n\nA Russian presidential election is due to take place on 15-17 March 2024. Vladimir Putin has ruled Russia as either President or Prime Minister (between 2008 and 2012) from 1999. The last 2018 presidential election was not found to be free and fair by Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) election observers. Human rights defenders the Movement for Defence of Voters' Rights Golos (the only independent nationwide Russian election observation movement) continues to document violations of the human right to participate in free and fair elections, as does European human rights defenders Russian Election Monitor.\n\nRussian human rights defenders such as OVD-Info continue to document serious human rights violations, as do international human rights defenders such as Human Rights Watch.\n\nAmong many human rights violations, torture has been repeatedly documented by Russian journalists working with the Latvia-based Meduza media project. Corruption is also widespread, as has been documented by the Organised Crime and Corruption Media Project.\n\nUnder June 2022 amendments, Russia will not enforce any European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) decision which came into force after 15 March 2022, and will pay outstanding compensation in earlier cases only in Roubles and not to bank accounts in countries deemed \"unfriendly\". \"Russia hasn't been the best in enforcing ECtHR judgments domestically, far from it,\" a Jehovah's Witness lawyer told Forum 18, but added that positive judgments \"generally slowed down the infringements\". Moscow lawyer Sergey Okhotin described the amendments as \"retroactively depriving Russian citizens of the right to international protection\".\n\nThis survey documents the most serious (but not all) freedom of religion or belief violations within Russia's internationally-recognised borders.\n\nThe renewed 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was preceded by the 2014 invasion and illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. In 2014, Russian-backed rebels also seized some eastern parts of Ukraine's Donbas. Since then, the Russian government has continued to commit serious freedom of religion or belief violations in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory.\n\nThese violations, along with violations of other human rights since Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, have also been documented by the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) among others.\n\nBefore Russia's renewed 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the most serious freedom of religion or belief violations within Russia's internationally-recognised borders were \"extremism\"-related criminal prosecutions and jailings of Jehovah's Witnesses and of Muslims who meet to study the works of the late Turkish theologian Said Nursi (1877-1960).\n\nThe activities being prosecuted are similar, including meeting without state permission in homes to pray and sing together, study sacred texts, and to discuss shared beliefs.\n\nMuslims who meet to study the writings of theologian Said Nursi may also be prosecuted under the Extremism Law for organising or participating in the activities of \"Nurdzhular\". Muslims in Russia deny any such formal organisation exists, but the Supreme Court banned it as \"extremist\" in 2008.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses have been liable to criminal prosecution since the 2017 Supreme Court ruling which liquidated their Administrative Centre (and its subsidiary structures) as an \"extremist organisation\" and outlawed their activities nationwide.\n\nTexts by and about Nursi in Russian translation and multiple Jehovah's Witness publications are on the Justice Ministry's Federal List of Extremist Materials, alongside material which incites the violations of human rights. Any lower court can, without considering evidence, order any text to be added to the Federal List, which prohibits their production and distribution within Russia. The List's length, complexity, bibliographical shortcomings, and irregular updates make it very difficult or even impossible to check whether a particular item has been banned.\n\nPossessing texts on the List makes individuals and religious communities liable to administrative prosecution (while the presence of banned literature can form part of evidence in a criminal case). Before the 2017 nationwide ban on Jehovah's Witness organisations, local Jehovah's Witness communities were administratively prosecuted for possession of items on the List - sometimes apparently planted by police during searches - and then banned as local organisations.\n\nThe removal of an item from the Federal List is rare and can be short-lived, and in recent years new texts have been added at an increasing rate.\n\nTypically, the first those targeted know of an \"extremism\" case against them is early morning or late night raids on their homes by large numbers of armed and masked officers from agencies such as the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Investigative Committee, the National Guard, and possibly other agencies - including in one instance the Investigative Department of the Russian Navy's Northern Fleet. Officials search homes and confiscate electronic devices and personal items such as bank cards, money, religious literature, and photographs. Such searches can take many hours.\n\nInvestigators then take some people away for questioning and possible detention. The raids take place after those targeted have been under FSB or police surveillance for some months, using methods such as covert recordings of meetings and conversations, CCTV cameras, and monitoring of social media accounts.\n\nMost of those prosecuted are placed on the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring) \"List of Terrorists and Extremists\", even before any trial takes place (see below).\n\nAfter being kept under FSB security service or police surveillance for some months, Muslims who meet to study the works of Said Nursi and Jehovah's Witnesses tend to be prosecuted under Criminal Code Article 282.2 for \"organising\" (Part 1), or \"participating in\" (Part 2), \"the activity of a social or religious association or other organisation in relation to which a court has adopted a decision legally in force on liquidation or ban on the activity in connection with the carrying out of extremist activity\". The majority of convictions have been under this Article.\n\nPossible punishments are:\n\nPart 1 (\"organising\")\n\n- six to 10 years' imprisonment and compulsory restrictions on freedom for one to two years after release, plus a compulsory ban on holding certain positions and/or carrying out certain activities for up to 10 years (see below);\n\n- or a 400,000 to 800,000 Rouble fine;\n\nPart 2 (\"participating\")\n\n- two to six years' imprisonment, plus a possible ban on holding certain positions and/or carrying out certain activities for up to five years, and compulsory restrictions on freedom for up to one year after release (see below);\n\n- or a 300,000 to 600,000 Rouble fine;\n\n- or one to four years' assigned work and compulsory restrictions on freedom for up to one year, plus a possible ban on holding certain positions and/or carrying out certain activities for up to three years (see below).\n\nProsecutors have also brought charges against several Jehovah's Witnesses under Criminal Code Article 282.3, Part 1 (\"Financing extremist activity\"), apparently for continuing to collect donations for activities from other Jehovah's Witnesses. Possible punishments are:\n\n- three to eight years' imprisonment;\n\n- or a 300,000 to 700,000 Rouble fine;\n\n- or one to four years' assigned work, plus a possible ban on holding certain positions and/or carrying out certain activities for up to three years (see below).\n\nProsecutors have also brought charges against Jehovah's Witnesses and Muslims under Criminal Code Article 282.2, Part 1.1 (\"Inclination, recruitment or other involvement of a person in an extremist organisation\"). Possible punishments are:\n\n- four to eight years' imprisonment;\n\n- or a 300,000 to 700,000 Rouble fine;\n\n- or two to five years' assigned work, plus a possible ban on holding certain positions and/or carrying out certain activities for up to three years (see below).\n\nA fine of 300,000 Roubles represented in early 2024 about 4 months' wages for those in formal work at the average rate of pay across Russia. Levels of pay vary widely, however, from region to region. Such a fine represents about 15 months' pension for those on the average level of pension.\n\nAll the above prison terms may also be suspended. This means that the convicted person does not have to serve the time in prison unless they are found guilty of another crime or repeated administrative offence. This includes offences unrelated to the activity which led to their original conviction. Judges can also impose a range of restrictions on freedom both during the probationary periods of suspended sentences, and for certain periods after a person's release from imprisonment.\n\nSuspended sentences are the most common form of punishment handed down to Jehovah's Witnesses found guilty of \"organising\" or \"participating\" in allegedly \"extremist\" activity such as continuing to meet for worship.\n\nBetween the Supreme Court's 2017 ban on the Jehovah's Witnesses and 13 March 2024, investigators had opened criminal cases against 762 individuals in 73 of Russia's 83 federal subjects. First-instance courts had convicted 466 people and ultimately acquitted none. A total of 128 Jehovah's Witnesses are on trial as of mid-March 2024 in first-instance courts, while another 147 remain under investigation or awaiting court appearances. Investigators and prosecutors have dropped the criminal charges against only 21 people (three of whom are dead).\n\nThirteen Jehovah's Witnesses have died during or after being investigated - two while on trial, two shortly after charges against them were dropped, the rest before their cases reached court. They included a 90-year-old woman who was the oldest person ever to be added to the Rosfinmonitoring \"List of Terrorists and Extremists\". (The oldest person on the List as of mid-March 2024 is also a Jehovah's Witness, who will turn 90 this year.)\n\nOf those convicted, 147 have received prison terms ranging from one to eight years in length, while 247 have received suspended sentences and 60 fines. Five people have been sentenced to terms of assigned work (prinuditelniye raboty). (One man was found guilty posthumously but the court issued no sentence. The sentences of six convicted people remain unclear.)\n\nThere are eight interlocking consequences related to \"extremism\" investigations and criminal convictions for exercising freedom of religion or belief:\n\na) during investigation and even if no trial takes place, inclusion on the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring) \"List of Terrorists and Extremists\", which blocks their bank accounts, and causes problems in finding formal employment, obtaining insurance, buying and selling property, and a range of other financial activities.\n\nb) if convicted, the prison sentence itself, or possible fines which must be paid within 30 days of the fine entering legal force;\n\nc) for suspended sentences, a probationary period during which any other conviction would send the defendant to prison;\n\nd) for those not given prison or suspended sentences, or fines, a possible period of assigned work. This may take the form of a paid job in any organisation, as determined by the correctional centre administering the sentence. Deductions from pay of 5 to 20 per cent may be transferred to the prison service. The assigned work depends on availability and the convicted person has no right to refuse. Officials check on convicted persons' locations at least once a day;\n\ne) a possible period of restrictions on freedom. This normally includes a curfew between particular hours, a ban on visiting certain places, a ban on leaving one's home town, a ban on attendance at or participating in particular events, a ban on changing one's place of residence, work, or study without the probation authorities' permission, and an obligation to register with probation authorities one to four times per month;\n\nf) Sudimost, or the state of having an active criminal record. Individuals may face a harsher sentence if prosecuted and convicted again during this period. Individuals are also barred from holding jobs in sectors such as the aviation industry, education, finance, the police and similar agencies, the civil service, and from standing for election. Although there is no legal bar on employment in other sectors, many people find it hard to secure formal work after criminal convictions. Sudimost expires at the end of the probationary period for those who have received suspended sentences. For those who have received fines, sudimost expires one year after the fine is paid. The length of sudimost for those given prison terms depends on the category of crime of which they have been convicted - for serious offences such as those under Criminal Code Article 282.2 (\"Organisation of\" or \"participating in\" the activity of a banned \"extremist\" organisation), sudimost lasts for eight years;\n\ng) for those given prison sentences, administrative supervision for the entirety of their period of sudimost. Administrative supervision consists of a set of restrictions on movements and activities, and a requirement to register regularly with the police;\n\nh) and for those convicted under Criminal Code Article 282.2 (\"Organisation of\" or \"participating in\" the activity of a banned \"extremist\" organisation), either compulsory or discretionary bans on holding particular positions or undertaking particular activities. These include: leading, participating in, or holding positions of responsibility in religious or public organisations. This would ban an individual from any participating in any registered religious organisation - even a religious community with no connection to their conviction. Individuals can also be banned from other activities, such as speaking publicly and publishing in the media and on the internet.\n\nIn October 2021, the Supreme Court directed judges to ascertain a defendant's \"specific actions\" in relation to continuing a banned organisation, noting that actions \"consisting solely of the exercise of their right to freedom of conscience and freedom of religion .. do not in themselves constitute a crime .. if they do not contain signs of extremism\".\n\nThis guidance appears to have had virtually no effect on the conviction rate for Jehovah's Witnesses charged with \"organising\" or \"participating in\" the activities of a banned \"extremist organisation\". Courts have now overturned all eight acquittals of Jehovah's Witnesses found not guilty of \"extremism\" offences after the 2017 ban on their activity. All the acquittals were at least partly based on amended Supreme Court guidance.\n\nAll eight previously acquitted individuals have since been re-tried and seven were found guilty (a court in Sverdlovsk Region freed one woman from criminal responsibility because the statute of limitations for minors had expired - Darya Dulova was under 18 when her alleged offences took place). Two men received prison term upon re-trial - one of them, Dmitry Barmakin from Vladivostok, was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment, the joint-longest term known to have been imposed on a Jehovah's Witness - while the other five received suspended sentences.\n\nSimilarly, the Supreme Court guidance appears to have had no effect on the conviction rate for Muslims who read the works of theologian Said Nursi, who often face similar \"extremism\"-related charges. The guidance has, however, resulted in the early release from prison of one Muslim prosecuted for studying Nursi's works.\n\nCourts have almost exclusively handed down convictions in criminal cases against both Jehovah's Witnesses and Muslims who meet to read Nursi's works, and more appeals have been unsuccessful than successful. Prosecutors persist in challenging every decision that higher courts may make in favour of defendants.\n\n\"It is necessary to understand that every region and even every court in Russia has its own practice,\" Jehovah's Witness lawyers told Forum 18 on 14 September 2022. \"Everyone is guilty, but the punishment is different everywhere.\" The defence \"of course\" refers to the Supreme Court guidance in every case, Jehovah's Witness lawyers told Forum 18 on 13 June 2023, but \"the judges ignore it completely\".\n\n\"The Supreme Court made a clear indication to all judges when it overturned two of our acquittals in the case of Zolotova et al. in Yelizovo [Kamchatka Region] and the case of Pryanikov et al. in Karpinsk,\" the lawyers added. In both these cases, prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court after the defendants were acquitted based on the Supreme Court guidance. The Supreme Court then ignored its own guidance and sent the cases back to lower courts for re-examination.\n\nRetired bookkeeper Vera Zolotova (born 20 October 1946) and teachers Snezhana Bazhenova and Konstantin Bazhenov were arrested by the Investigative Committee after searches of their homes in the town of Yelizovo in Kamchatka Region on 19 August 2018. On 25 September 2020 all three received two-year suspended sentences, with three-year probationary periods and six months of restrictions on freedom. They were eventually acquitted on 18 January 2022 by appeal judges at Kamchatka Regional Court. Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court, which returned the cases for re-examination in April 2022. In January 2023, all three Jehovah's Witnesses had their punishments upheld by Kamchatka Regional Court - the same court which had acquitted all three a year earlier.\n\nForum 18 asked Kamchatka Regional Court on 9 June 2023 why it had found Zolotova and the Bazhenovs guilty when it had acquitted them a year before, why collective prayer and Bible reading were considered crimes, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's amended guidance, and who had been harmed by the defendants' actions. Zhanna Pchelina, head of the Department for Codification and Harmonisation of Judicial Practice, refused on 14 June to answer Forum 18's questions. Other courts in such cases have also not answered Forum 18's questions.\n\nThere are much smaller numbers of Muslims who meet to read Nursi's works, and so smaller numbers of prosecutions. In one of the two trials in 2023 which have ended in jail sentences, on 13 March, after a nine-month trial in Naberezhnyye Chelny (Tatarstan), Khunar Agayev and Aydar Sageyev were jailed for 2 years and 6 months for meeting other Muslims to read Nursi's works. They were both charged with \"organising the activities of a banned extremist organisation.\" Amrakh Akhmedov, charged with \"participating\", received a suspended sentence of 1 year and 6 months with 2 years' probation. All had been detained since being arrested in November 2021.\n\nAgayev testified in court that he had read Nursi's books \"to understand the Koran [and] strengthen his faith\" and considers himself an \"ordinary Muslim\". When others were interested, he explained Nursi's works to them and translated for those who did not understand Turkish. The judge also ordered a number of books by and about Said Nursi, seized from the men during the investigation, to be destroyed as they were all \"used as the means of commission of a crime\".\n\nThe Tatarstan Investigative Committee, the Federal Investigative Committee in Moscow, and Tatarstan Prosecutor's Office have all not answered Forum 18's questions about why the men were considered dangerous, who had been harmed by their actions, and why jail sentences were sought.\n\nThe largest trial since 2018 of Muslims who met to study the works of Turkish theologian Said Nursi ended in Moscow on 27 June 2023. After nearly 30 hearings from August 2022, Judge Yuliya Frolova jailed all 6 defendants for terms ranging from 2 years and 7 months up to 6 years and 7 months. All six defendants were also given varying terms of post-prison punishments, including four-year bans on \"participating in or leadership of public religious organisations\", and restrictions on freedom (cannot change address or leave place of residence without informing probation authorities, 10pm to 6am curfew unless going out necessary for work).\n\nThese are the harshest punishments handed down to Muslims who met to study Nursi's works since Ilgar Aliyev was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment in 2018.\n\nIn their indictment, investigators noted how the men read aloud from Nursi's books in each other's homes, discussed their meaning, prayed, and drank tea together. The judge should have taken into account 2021 amendments to the Supreme Court's 2011 decree governing the application of the Extremism Law. A lawyer in the Moscow case commented to Forum 18 that the judge had \"interpreted [the guidance] in her own way\".\n\nForum 18 asked Moscow's Kuzminsky District Court why the Judge had found the six men guilty in light of the amended Supreme Court guidance, whom these activities had harmed and why the men were considered dangerous. Galina Gonchar, chair of Kuzminsky District Court, replied without addressing Forum 18's questions on 10 July 2023, but stated that \"When passing sentence, the court examines all the factual circumstances of a case, as a result of which a proper assessment of all the facts will be given\".\n\nIn December 2023, the same court began hearing the case of two more Muslims who read Nursi's works. By mid-March 2024, 45-year-old Zurab Dzhabrailov and 53-year-old Dzheykhun Rustamov had made four court appearances. The two have been held at Moscow's Butyrka prison since August 2023. Investigative Committee and FSB security service documents seen by Forum 18 reveal the investigation - which has involved covert surveillance - has been ongoing since 2017.\n\nInvestigators and prosecutors tend not to specify any \"victims\" in such criminal cases, despite considering defendants dangerous enough to seek long prison sentences. Several of the defendants raise this point themselves.\n\n\"The courts are called to fight crime, but I still do not understand what my crime is,\" Jehovah's Witness Yelena Nikulina told Lenin District Court in Saransk on 15 August 2022. \"There are no victims in our case, but there are still injured parties - and they are in front of you, in the dock!\" Her husband Georgy Nikulin noted in his final speech: \"It turns out that I am on trial not because I committed some real crime and am therefore dangerous to society. I am subject to criminal prosecution only because I am a Christian, a Jehovah's Witness.\"\n\nBoth the Nikulins were on 25 August 2022 sentenced to 4 years and 2 months' imprisonment, with 1 year and 2 months' restrictions on freedom. They were both added to Rosfinmonitoring List on 11 April 2019, after they (along with other Jehovah's Witnesses sentenced in the same trial) were detained during raids on nine homes in Saransk on 6 February 2019. Along with other defendants Nikulin was kept in custody for 147 days, and was not officially charged until 2021.\n\nForum 18 has repeatedly asked the Prosecutor's Offices which lodge criminal cases and the courts which consider them why defendants are convicted in light of the Supreme Court's amended guidance, in what way they could be considered dangerous, and why prosecutors seek such long sentences. No officials have addressed these questions in their responses, instead stating that they are unable to answer such enquiries or directing Forum 18 to statements on court websites.\n\nIn the Nikulins' case above, Lenin District Court's press release of 12 September 2022 stated that \"In imposing punishment on the convicts, the court took into account the nature and degree of social danger of the crimes committed, the character of the perpetrators, [and] mitigating circumstances, as well as the impact of the punishment on their correction, and came to the conclusion that achieving the aim of punishment is possible only by isolating the convicts from society\".\n\nThe United Nations (UN) Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment defines torture as \"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity\".\n\nUnder the Convention, Russia is obliged both to arrest any person suspected on good grounds of having committed torture \"or take other legal measures to ensure his [sic] presence\", and also to try them under criminal law which makes \"these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature\".\n\nTorture nevertheless remains common, and the perpetrators are rarely punished. The UN Committee Against Torture's (CAT) Concluding Observations (CAT/C/RUS/CO/6) on Russia, released in August 2018, stated: \"The Committee is deeply concerned at numerous reliable reports of the practice of torture and ill-treatment in the State party, including as a means to extract confessions, and at many recent reports documenting cases of torture. .. The Committee is also concerned at reports that allegations of torture rarely resulted in criminal prosecutions and that, even when prosecuted, the perpetrators were charged with simple assault or abuse of authority\". The CAT also urged Russia \"to combat impunity in torture and ill-treatment cases\".\n\nFreedom of religion cases involving torture have included the torture of seven Jehovah's Witnesses in Surgut in February 2019 for refusing to give information on fellow-believers and their meetings. Instead of being arrested and investigated, in April 2019 two of the Investigative Committee officials implicated in the torture of the Jehovah's Witnesses were given awards, ostensibly for their work in 2018. Vladimir Yermolayev won \"best local department head\", and Sergei Bogodyorov took second place in the \"best investigator\" competition. No individual or institution is known to have been punished for torture.\n\nFour prisoners of conscience convicted for exercising their freedom of religion or belief are known to have been deprived of Russian citizenship and deported from Russia after completing their prison sentences. In the most recent known case, despite living half his life in Russia and marrying a Russian citizen, 46-year-old Jehovah's Witness Rustam Seidkuliyev was deported to his native Turkmenistan in September 2023 after completing his two-and-half-year jail term for exercising freedom of religion or belief.\n\nOfficials did not explain to Forum 18 why Seidkuliyev's Russian citizenship had been annulled in 2022, given his long residence in Russia, that there were no victims in his criminal case, and that his family had had to leave Turkmenistan in 2000 because of their exercise of freedom of religion or belief.\n\nLike the earlier cases, officials annulled Seidkuliyev's citizenship on the basis of Article 22 of the Citizenship Law, under which conviction for particular criminal offences is taken as equivalent to the provision of false information in a citizenship application.\n\nAs of the beginning of February 2024, Russia's Interior Ministry had included in its Federal Wanted List at least 42 individuals facing criminal charges to punish them for exercising freedom of religion or belief or for reporting on violations of this right. Eleven of these individuals had been included on Russia's list even though they were sought by the authorities of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan or Uzbekistan. Three opponents of Russia's war against Ukraine on religious grounds are also included, as are four Jehovah's Witnesses from Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nOther individuals on the Federal Wanted List include political opponents of the regimes in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Russia's Federal Wanted List is maintained by the Interior Ministry. On 13 February 2024, independent Russian media outlet Mediazona published the full list of 95,994 individuals on the database in early February.\n\nIf any of these individuals wanted in Russia are caught in Russia, arrive in Russia or are caught in states that are friendly to Russia (such as Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan or Uzbekistan), they risk immediate arrest as investigators complete any criminal case. If any are wanted by Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan or Uzbekistan and are found in Russia, they risk arrest and immediate transfer to that country.\n\nThe Interior Ministry has not answered Forum 18's questions on why the Federal Wanted List included Russian citizens who had peacefully exercised their right to freedom of religion or belief, as well as citizens of Belarus, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan who had exercised the same right.\n\nRussia is known to have illegally asked Interpol to distribute Red Notices to try to have other countries arrest and transfer at least some of these individuals, the most recent such known case being in 2020. Yuliya Burenina of the National Central Bureau (NCB) for Interpol of Russia's Interior Ministry in Moscow refused to explain to Forum 18 in March 2023 why Russia has sought Red Notices for individuals wanted for exercising their freedom of religion or belief.\n\nInterpol on 15 February 2024 told Forum 18: \"Since the Interpol General Secretariat implemented heightened supervision and monitoring measures in relation to Russia in March 2022 all outgoing Notices, Diffusions and messages from NCB Moscow are first reviewed for compliance by the General Secretariat before being shared with any member country.\"\n\nAfter Russia's renewed February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin signed into law new specific Criminal Code and Administrative Code penalties for allegedly \"discrediting\" and spreading alleged \"false information\" about Russia's actions in its renewed invasion of Ukraine. These entered into force on 4 March 2022. Other new legal amendments punish calling for sanctions against Russia. Some of the Criminal Code penalties were increased on 28 March 2023.\n\nAlso on 28 March 2023, the Administrative and Criminal Code definitions were widened to include criticism of \"volunteer formations, organisations and individuals who assist in the fulfilment of tasks assigned to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation\" (that is, private mercenary units such as Wagner). On 25 December 2023, further amendments widened the definitions to include criticism of new volunteer units of the National Guard (Rosgvardiya). These units have recruited former Wagner mercenaries.\n\nThese Administrative and Criminal Code articles are:\n\nAdministrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 1 punishes \"Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens [and] maintain international peace and security, including public calls to prevent the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for these purposes, or [actions aimed at] discrediting the execution by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers outside the territory of the Russian Federation for the specified purposes, as well as discrediting the provision of assistance by volunteer formations, organisations or individuals in the performance of tasks assigned to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation\".\n\n- Part 1 carries these possible fines:\n\n- for individuals - 30,000 to 50,000 Roubles;\n\n- for people in official positions - 100,000 to 200,000 Roubles;\n\n- for legal entities - 300,000 to 500,000 Roubles.\n\nA fine of 50,000 Roubles represented approximately three weeks' average wages in early 2024 for those in work, or more than two months' average state retirement pension. The equivalents vary from region to region.\n\nAdministrative Code Article 20.3.3, Part 2 covers the same actions, if they are: \"accompanied by calls to hold unauthorised public events, or create a threat of harm to the life and/or) health of citizens [or] property, a threat of mass disruption of public order and (or) public safety, or a threat of interfering with or stopping the functioning the functioning of objects of life support, transport or social infrastructure, credit organisations, energy facilities, industry or communications.\"\n\n- Part 2 carries possible fines:\n\n- for individuals - 50,000 to 100,000 Roubles;\n\n- for people in official positions - 200,000 to 300,000 Roubles;\n\n- for legal entities - 500,000 to 1 million Roubles.\n\nA fine of 50,000 Roubles represented approximately three weeks' average wages in early 2024 for those in work, or more than two months' average state retirement pension. The equivalents vary from region to region.\n\nA fine of 1 million Roubles represented approximately 13 months' average wages in early 2024 for those in work, or around 4 years' average state retirement pension. The equivalents vary from region to region.\n\nAdministrative Code Article 20.3.3 is used against apparently any form of anti-war statement either in public spaces or online.\n\nIf individuals commit an offence covered by Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 (\"Public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation\") more than once in twelve months, they may be prosecuted under Criminal Code Article 280.3.\n\nPart 1 carries these possible punishments:\n\n- a fine of 100,000 to 300,000 Roubles;\n\n- or up to three years' assigned work;\n\n- or 4 to 6 months' detention in an \"arrest house\" (arestny dom);\n\n- or up to 5 years' imprisonment, followed by up to 5 years' deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities.\n\n- Part 2 punishes the same actions, if \"resulting in death by negligence and/or causing harm to the health of citizens, [or] property, [or causing] mass violations of public order and/or public safety, or interfering with or stopping the functioning of life support, transport or social infrastructure, credit organisations, energy facilities, industry or communications.\"\n\nThe punishments are:\n\n- a fine of 300,000 to 1 million Roubles;\n\n- or up to 7 years' imprisonment, followed by up to 7 years' deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities.\n\nA fine of 1 million Roubles represented approximately 13 months' average wages in early 2024 for those in work, or around 4 years' average state retirement pension. The equivalents vary from region to region.\n\nCriminal Code Article 207.3, Part 1 punishes \"Public dissemination, under the guise of credible statements, of knowingly false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in order to protect the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens [and] maintain international peace and security, or about the exercise by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers outside the territory of the Russian Federation for those purposes, as well as [knowingly false information] on the provision of assistance by volunteer formations, organisations or individuals in the performance of tasks assigned to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation or the troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation\".\n\n- Part 1 carries the following punishments:\n\n- a fine of 700,000 to 1.5 million Roubles;\n\n- or up to 1 year's correctional work;\n\n- or up to 5 years' assigned work;\n\n- or up to 5 years' imprisonment.\n\nA fine of 1 million Roubles represented approximately 13 months' average wages in early 2024 for those in work, or around 4 years' average state retirement pension. The equivalents vary from region to region.\n\nAssigned work may be imposed instead of imprisonment, and may take the form of any job in any organisation, as determined by the correctional centre responsible for administering the sentence. It is paid, but deductions of 5-20 per cent may be transferred to the prison service.\n\nCorrectional work - a lesser category of punishment - involves payment to the state of 5-20 per cent of wages, either from one's own job or, if unemployed, from a job allocated by the local authority in cooperation with the prison service.\n\nCriminal Code Article 207.3, Part 2 punishes the same actions, \"a) by a person using their official position; b) \"by a group of persons, a group of persons by prior conspiracy or an organised group\"; v) with the artificial creation of evidence for accusations; g) for selfish motives; or d) for reasons of political, ideological, racial, national or religious hatred or enmity, or for reasons of hatred or enmity against any social group\".\n\n- Part 2 carries the following punishments:\n\n- a fine of 3 million to 5 million Roubles;\n\n- or up to 5 years' assigned work \"with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years\";\n\n- or 5 to 10 years' imprisonment \"with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years\".\n\nCriminal Code Article 207.3, Part 3 punishes the same actions if they have \"grave consequences\", and carries the following punishment:\n\n- 10 to 15 years' imprisonment \"with deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to 5 years\".\n\nPolice and other investigative agencies also use other Criminal Code articles against people protesting against the war, such as Article 213 (\"Hooliganism\"), Article 214 (\"Vandalism\"), and Article 318 (\"Violence against the authorities\"). These are not yet known to have been used against anyone protesting from a religious perspective.\n\nSince Russia's renewed invasion of Ukraine, the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) had blocked access to over 3,000 websites for reasons of \"military censorship\", according to a 13 July 2022 report by digital rights organisation Roskomsvoboda. These include foreign media outlets such as Radio Free Europe, Russian independent media such as Meduza, and human rights defenders such as Human Rights Watch.\n\nRoskomnadzor has blocked Russian-language religious news websites, including Latvian-based news website Baznica.info, and foreign Protestant website InVictory.org. In September 2023 Roskomnadzor blocked access to the Russian-language shaltnotkill.info website of the Christians Against War group. It had earlier blocked access to foreign websites such as Fordham University's Orthodox Christian Studies Centre's website publicorthodoxy.org which has critically covered Russian Orthodoxy and the war.\n\nRoskomnadzor has also blocked access in Russia to the websites of a number of religious organisations in Ukraine, including the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organisations.\n\nRussia's government has used a range of tactics to pressure religious leaders into supporting the renewed invasion of Ukraine. These tactics include warnings to senior and local religious leaders, and prosecuting and fining religious believers and clergy who have publicly opposed the war. It is unclear what effect this has had on religious believers who may have considered making a public protest against Russia's war. Similar warnings and prosecutions have been used against many Russians who express opposition to the war for any reason.\n\nIn March, as Russia's war against Ukraine was intensifying, the FSB security service warned local religious leaders not to publicly oppose the war. In some cases lack of opposition is due to warnings to senior and local religious leaders, and prosecuting and fining religious believers and clergy who have publicly opposed the war. In one region, a Protestant pastor noted, at least three fellow pastors received such individual warnings. \"Such warnings don't take place now,\" the pastor told Forum 18 on 15 July 2022. \"Those [March warnings] were enough for everyone.\"\n\nTwo senior religious leaders - Lutheran Bishop Dietrich Brauer and Chief Rabbi of Moscow Pinchas Goldschmidt - both felt they had to leave Russia. They have stated that they and other religious leaders came under pressure not to discuss or condemn Russia's renewed war against Ukraine, Bishop Bauer stating that at the start of the war, Vladimir Putin's administration made \"a clear demand\" of religious leaders to speak out in favour of the invasion.\n\nOn 27 January 2023, the Justice Ministry named Telo Tulku Rinpoche (Erdni-Basan Ombadykov), the Dalai Lama's representative in Russia, as a \"foreign agent\" because he spoke against the war - the first religious leader to be added to the \"foreign agents\" register. The following day, Rinpoche - who had left the country months earlier - stood down from his position as president (Supreme Lama) of the Association of Buddhists of Kalmykiya. \"I wish that the people of Kalmykiya and all followers of Buddhism in these difficult times maintain courage, steadfastness, and adherence to the ideals of compassion, love and non-violence,\" he commented.\n\nMany Russian religious leaders, most prominently the Moscow Patriarchate hierarchy, support the renewed invasion without any apparent coercion being applied. These figures include Patriarch Kirill of the Moscow Patriarchate, Mufti Talgat Tadzhuddin of the Central Spiritual Administration of Muslims of Russia, Old Believer Metropolitan Kornily, and Bishop Sergey Ryakhovsky of the Pentecostal Union.\n\nWhile many religious organisations in Russia support the invasion of Ukraine, small numbers of laypeople and clergy continue to protest from an explicitly religious perspective. Like thousands of other Russians who every day voice their opposition to the war in public spaces and online, they are soon detained by police and frequently prosecuted and fined. Many of the religious believers who have opposed the war have been Russian Orthodox, both of the Moscow Patriarchate and other branches.\n\nThey have included Russian Orthodox priest Fr Ioann Burdin of the Moscow Patriarchate's Kostroma Diocese, who was on 10 March 2022 fined one month's average local wages for online remarks and a Sunday sermon in church condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and stressing the importance of the commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill\". Similarly, Moscow Patriarchate Deacon Sergey Shcherbyuk in Samara was also fined about one month's average local wages for \"discrediting the Russian armed forces\" in conversations with parishioners and colleagues. One of them apparently reported him to the Interior Ministry. In October 2022, Russian Orthodox (ROCOR) priest Nikandr Pinchuk became the first person criminally convicted for opposing Russia's war in Ukraine on religious grounds. A court in the Urals fined him two months' average local wages for a social media post.\n\nOther Russian Orthodox priests have resigned from their posts and in some cases left the country, after their opposition to the war brought them into conflict with their Moscow Patriarchate dioceses. These have included Moscow Patriarchate priest Aleksandr Dombrovsky, who left Russia in January 2023, thinking that he would be prosecuted for preaching about \"how terrible is war and how important is peace\".\n\nUntil late 2022, Fr Aleksandr was Rector of the Church of St Nicholas the Miracle-worker in the village of Muzhinovo in Bryansk Region. Fr Aleksandr described how, on 28 October 2022, Bishop Vladimir (Novikov) of Klintsy and Trubchevsk Diocese (part of the Bryansk Metropolitanate) \"reproached me for my dislike of Russia and asked me not to speak out on political topics in the future, because: 'The church is separate from the state'\".\n\n\"However\", Fr Aleksandr commented to Forum 18, \"this 'separation' has not prevented Patriarch Kirill from blessing this war, passing off outright evil for patriotism.\" The diocesan authorities asked Fr Aleksandr to write an \"explanation\" and threatened to remove his rank of priest: \"I really tried for a while not to preach anti-war sermons, but it still didn't help me.\"\n\nIn December 2022, the Bryansk Metropolitanate banned him from serving as a priest and made him supernumerary [pochislit za shtat], ostensibly over \"negligence\" in relation to a fire which destroyed the church building. The Diocese also banned him from serving as a priest and made him \"supernumerary\" in mid-December, also citing his anti-war statements and - since there is nothing in canon law allowing the removal of priestly rank for criticising the secular authorities - his second marriage (which took place in 2003 but was later annulled).\n\nMuzhinovo's wooden church (and some other buildings in the village) burned down on 31 October 2022 after a power surge. In a public post on 6 January 2023 in the VKontakte group of another parish of which Fr Aleksandr was the rector - St Elijah in the village of Mirny - he noted that the fire service had found that the Muzhinovo church had caught fire because faults in its electrical wiring rendered it vulnerable to the power surge. He stated that all electrical work on the recently finished building had been organised by the churchwarden [starosta] - who, as he learned on 9 January, appears to have denounced him to the police and FSB for his anti-war sermons.\n\nFr Aleksandr explained to Forum 18, however, that the diocesan authorities had earlier reprimanded him for his \"dislike of Russia\" and \"threatened to defrock\" him because of his preaching against Russia's war in Ukraine. Late on 9 January 2023, local police \"invited\" Fr Aleksandr to the police station in nearby Kletnya, he told Forum 18 on 31 January, and informed him that the Bryansk Region branch of the Federal Security Service (FSB) had opened a criminal case against him.\n\nThe investigation was initiated on the basis of a statement from the churchwarden [starosta] of the Muzhinovo parish. She had apparently also provided investigators with \"all my notes, correspondence, [and] voice messages, and even managed to record me in church on a dictaphone\", Fr Aleksandr added. \"Everything related to my anti-war position was recorded in a most thorough manner.\"\n\nThe police allowed him to leave after he wrote a statement. Faced with criminal prosecution, Fr Aleksandr decided to leave the country shortly afterwards, and is now \"far from the Russian Federation,\" as he told Forum 18 on 9 February 2023.\n\nIt is unknown under which article of the Criminal Code the FSB opened its case against Fr Aleksandr, but it is likely to be Criminal Code Article 207.3 (\"Public dissemination, under the guise of credible statements, of knowingly false information on the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation\").\n\nForum 18 wrote to the Bryansk Region police and FSB about the case before the start of the working day of 8 February 2023, but no reply has yet been received.\n\nAnother of the Russians who have protested against the war is Nina Belyayeva, a Russian Protestant and Communist Party municipal deputy. She was the first known person to face criminal prosecution for opposing the war on explicitly religious grounds. During a 22 March 2022 Semiluk District Council meeting she called the invasion a war crime, asserting over the shouting of fellow deputies: \"A Christian is not someone who wears a cross, but someone who follows Christ, for whom the word of God - the authority of Christ - is much higher than the authority of the President .. for a Christian, first of all, the authority of Christ is higher than the opinion of the Patriarch..\" When accused of inciting Russian troops to surrender, Belyayeva explained that this was \"one way out for a Christian,\" and that every soldier chooses for himself: \"There are lawful orders and there are unlawful orders.\"\n\nTwenty out of 23 deputies voted to ask prosecutors to investigate Belyayeva, she was expelled from the Communist Party, and a case was opened against her under the new Criminal Code Article 207.3 (\"Public dissemination, under the guise of credible statements, of knowingly false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation\"). She had by then fled Russia.\n\nSimilarly, Russian Orthodox musician and teacher Anna Chagina was on 7 August 2023 fined and handed a ban on posting on the internet for two years for her opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Chagina was accused of \"discrediting\" the Russian armed forces more than once in a year - firstly, by displaying a poster reading \"Blessed are the peacemakers (Matthew 5:9)\" at an anti-war protest, and secondly, by making anti-war posts on social media, including reposts of texts by religious philosopher Nikolay Karpitsky.\n\nJudge Roman Zaynulin imposed the punishment \"with the aim of restoring social justice and preventing [Chagina] from committing a new offence.\" Chagina was fined almost 6 weeks' average wages in Tomsk Region, and must abide by travel restrictions and a good behaviour order. Her mobile phone will remain confiscated as it was \"used in the commission of the offence.\"\n\nThe first known prison term for opposing Russia's war against Ukraine from a religious perspective was imposed on 30 March 2023, when a Moscow court jailed 63-year-old Orthodox Christian Mikhail Simonov for 7 years for disseminating \"false information\" about the Russian armed forces on the basis of \"political hatred\". He had made two short social media posts condemning Russia's war against Ukraine, including: \"We, Russia, have become godless. Forgive us, Lord!\" The Investigative Committee and Prosecutor's Office did not answer Forum 18's questions about why they sought a long jail term for Simonov, who suffers from health problems\n\nThe second such jail term was on 31 August, when a St Petersburg court jailed former Moscow Patriarchate Orthodox 55-year-old Fr Ioann Kurmoyarov for 3 years and banned him from posting on the internet for 2 years for distributing \"false information about the Russian Armed Forces\". He had been in detention since June 2022 for posting videos opposing the war. Darya Lebedeva, head of the joint court system press service for St Petersburg, told Forum 18 that Fr Ioann must be held in detention as: \"If at liberty and not isolated from society, Kurmoyarov may continue his criminal activity, conceal himself from investigators and the court, destroy evidence and otherwise interfere with the criminal proceedings.\"\n\nOpposition to the war on religious grounds - as well as on non-religious grounds - continues.\n\nFor example, the clergy of a non-Moscow Patriarchate Russian Orthodox Church in the southern Krasnodar Region have repeatedly spoken out against Russia's war in Ukraine. Hieromonk Iona Sigida of the Holy Intercession Tikhonite Church (who was tortured during a raid and jailed for 2 days in October 2023) told Forum 18 on 25 October 2023: \"At least five searches took place simultaneously. One in the church, one at Archbishop Viktor [Pivovarov]'s place of registration, one at my place of registration, one at Fr Aleksandr's house church, and the fifth at the place of registration of Fr Aleksandr. All early in the morning.\" The raid on the church \"scared many people\", he said.\n\nIt remains unclear which agencies organised and carried out the raid. Neither the armed men nor the officers who interrogated Fr Iona identified themselves. The Krasnodar Region branches of the Investigative Committee, Federal Security Service (FSB), Interior Ministry, and National Guard have not replied to Forum 18's questions about the case.\n\nInvestigators have since brought a criminal case against 86-year-old Archbishop Viktor for repeat \"discreditation\" of the Armed Forces (he was initially fined 40,000 Roubles on 24 March 2023 under Administrative Code Article 20.3.3 Part 1). Archbishop Viktor \"is concerned that his persecution could harm both those around him and those who are trying to help\", a church member told Forum 18 on 5 January 2024, but is \"generally in good spirits\". The Archbishop made two appearances at Slavyansk City Court in February and March 2024; church members believe he will be sentenced on 8 April.\n\nSunday services have continued at the Holy Intercession Tikhonite Church, both after the armed raid and after the criminal case was opened against Archbishop Viktor. \"Officers come to every service, openly film everything and all the parishioners; others, under the guise of random people or parishioners, also holding their phones, ask intrusive questions,\" a church member told Forum 18.\n\n\"This is probably a method of intimidation. Near the church there is a car on duty around the clock, which changes in shifts, and those sitting inside it monitor people coming and going. During a service, one unknown suspicious person introduced himself as Fr Iona's lawyer, and asked where he could find him. Officers are now also talking to parishioners, trying to persuade them to become informants through lies and intimidation, and there is some evidence that they have already succeeded in persuading someone to cooperate.\"\n\nNo legal or practical provision exists for alternative civilian service (ACS) during mobilisation, despite the Constitution guaranteeing this right for every citizen. This has led to military recruitment offices refusing applications for ACS and sending conscientious objectors to military units. Moreover, a November 2022 legal amendment allows those already undertaking ACS in civilian institutions after being called up for regular conscript military service to be transferred to a non-combat role within the Armed Forces. The amendment effectively \"abolishes ACS as a peaceful alternative to military service\" during mobilisation, lawyer Valeriya Vetoshkina commented.\n\nRussian conscientious objectors to military service face many obstacles. Since President Vladimir Putin announced the \"partial mobilisation\" in September 2022, regular contract troops have been unable to resign. A legal loophole means that mobilised men who request alternative civilian service are typically refused. Individuals who refuse outright to go to Ukraine can be criminally prosecuted and imprisoned for failing to obey orders. In November 2023, military officials denied four young Baptist men in Siberia and the Far East the opportunity to carry out alternative civilian service, rather than military service, despite their efforts to prove their pacifist religious convictions. All had applied for alternative civilian service.\n\nOnly one - Timofey Reznichenko from Primorye Region - has successfully challenged this refusal in court, thus gaining the right to have his application re-examined. Brothers Daniil and German Strelkov, from Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Region, failed in their attempts to have their refusals ruled unlawful in court and are now preparing to appeal.\n\n\"Faith forbids him to take up arms, kill, or take oaths,\" a witness in Daniil's case told the court. In German's case, his father testified that he \"is a deeply religious person and will not take up arms or take an oath, as this is prohibited by [his] religion\". Krasnoyarsk Region courts twice declined to uphold Zakhar Asmalovsky's lawsuit against the military authorities, meaning he will now be subject to conscription in the future.\n\nNo official has answered Forum 18's questions about why Daniil and German Strelkov had been denied the opportunity to do alternative civilian service.\n\nAmong other freedom of religion or belief violations, individuals and religious organisations are prosecuted for unlawful \"missionary activity,\" including ordinary worship meetings for fellow believers, and not showing their complete officially registered names on literature, online, and most frequently on buildings. These prosecutions are based on amendments to the Administrative Code and Religion Law introduced in July 2016 as part of the \"Yarovaya\" package of \"anti-terrorism\" laws.\n\nThere were in 2021 at least 71 prosecutions across Russia under Administrative Code Article 5.26, Part 4 (\"Russians conducting missionary activity\") and Part 5 (\"Foreigners conducting missionary activity\"), according to Forum 18's analysis of available court records. A shift towards more prosecutions for Muslim religious activities, first observed by Forum 18 in 2019, continued. There was a conviction rate (for those cases which reached a verdict) of 84.62 per cent. All those convicted received fines, though seven of these were later overturned on appeal.\n\nReligious organisations also continue to face prosecution under Administrative Code Article 5.26, Part 3 (\"Implementation of activities by a religious organisation without indicating its official full name, including the issuing or distribution, within the framework of missionary activity, of literature and printed, audio, and video material without a label bearing this name, or with an incomplete or deliberately false label\").\n\nOn 27 April 2023, Moscow City Court approved Moscow's Justice Department's suit claiming that the Moscow-based SOVA Center for Information and Analysis should be closed down because it held events outside Moscow. SOVA monitored nationalism and xenophobia, the relationship between religion and society, and the formation and implementation of \"anti-extremist\" policy in Russia.\n\nThe order followed the pattern that led to the forced closure of the Memorial human rights organisation, with a media campaign, a complaint from the Veterans of Russia organisation, a demand from the General Prosecutor's Office, a Moscow Justice Department inspection and court suit. \"Organisations like SOVA or Memorial conducting subversive activity in Russia must be liquidated and brought to criminal responsibility,\" Ildar Rezyapov, who lodged the Veterans of Russia complaint and was involved in the closure of Memorial, told Forum 18. No Russian official or court answered Forum 18's questions about the liquidation suit.\n\nThe suit - seen by Forum 18 - noted that representatives of the SOVA Center had taken part in 24 events outside Moscow between 2020 and 2022. These included the Human Dimension Conference of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) online in 2020 and in-person in 2022, as well as other OSCE events, and events in Russian cities, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. On 17 August 2023, the First Appeal Court of General Jurisdiction refused SOVA's appeal and the order entered into legal force.\n\nThe SOVA Center has vowed to continue its work. \"SOVA is not going to stop monitoring and analysing the situation in the field of religious freedom, regardless of the form in which our organisation will continue to exist,\" Olga Sibiryova of SOVA Center told Forum 18. \"Sooner or later, this stage will also end, but the need for freedom of conscience and religion will not.\"\n\nAfter SOVA's forcible liquidation, a group of its former staff are now a community of researchers under the name of SOVA Research Center.",

        "title": "Building A Decent Gaza - Analysis",
        "body": "On Feb. 22, 2024, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented his Security Cabinet with a short document, \"The Day After Hamas.\" His office calls it \"principles reflecting a broad public consensus on the goals of the war, and the civil alternative to the terrorist organization's rule in the Gaza Strip.\" Its key passage states that the Government of Israel plans to work primarily with Gazans to rebuild their territory, secondly with friendly Arab states.\n\n\"Civil affairs and responsibility for public order will be based on local actors with \"management experience\" and not identified with countries or organizations supporting terrorism or receive payments from them; a de-radicalization program will be promoted in all religious, educational, and welfare institutions in the [Gaza] strip with as much as possible the involvement and assistance of Arab countries that have experience in promoting de-radicalization.\"\n\nIn a step toward this program of self-rule, the IDF in late February began an informal pilot program of what it called \"humanitarian pockets.\" Established in parts of north Gaza cleared of Hamas, they consist of local governing bodies of community leaders, including merchants and civil society leaders, whose duties include distributing humanitarian aid and revising school curricula. The process moves slowly. \"We're looking for the right people to step up to the plate,\" an official said. \"But it is clear that this will take time, as no one will come forward if they think Hamas will put a bullet in their head.\"\n\nIt bears noting that the Feb. 22 document does not mention the Palestinian Authority (PA), neither including nor excluding it. More generally, it avoids contentious issues. The New York Timescharacterized it as \"carefully written to postpone long-term decisions about the territory's fate and to avoid irreversible confrontations with both domestic allies and foreign partners.\"\n\nA confidential source informs me the plan relies heavily on a report, \"Building Pillars of Peace: An Option for Gaza,\" an independent analysis submitted to the government in August 2014. That report contains a mechanism for Gazans to run their own affairs through the creation of a Transitional International Presence based on the Oslo Accords. It recommends twelve Sector Working Groups to cover agriculture, education, employment creation, environment, health, infrastructure and housing, institution-building, police, private sector, public finance, tourism, and transport and telecommunications.[1]\n\nThe idea of Israel working with Gazans faces two main criticisms. One prefers to fit Gaza into a larger political context. U.S. President Joe Biden calls for \"a revitalized Palestinian Authority\" (abbreviated as RPA). Accordingly, U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby responded coolly to the plan, saying that \"the Palestinian people should have a voice and a vote ... through a revitalized Palestinian Authority.\"\n\nThe PA, naturally, hates the plan. A spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, derided it as \"aimed at continuing Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.\" So does Hamas; Palestinian analyst Mustafa Ibrahim dismissed it as \"a vision solely centered around Israel and its interests, with no regard for the humanity or rights of Palestinians.\"\n\nOthers propose alternative schemes. Mohammed Dahlan, a Gazan politician in exile, foresees a new Palestinian leader of Gaza (himself?) ruling with Arab state support. Yisrael Beytenu party leader Avigdor Liberman believes the Egyptians should take control of Gaza \"as a mandate of the United Nations and the Arab League.\" Natan Sharansky, the democracy advocate, hopes Saudis and Emiratis will help build \"an independent economy, a normal education, normal housing, a civil society.\" Nearly 40 percent of Israelis, including two prominent government ministers, want Jewish settlement of the territory.\n\nThe second criticism accepts that Gaza remain a separate territory but holds that Israel cannot find \"local actors\" to work with. They have several reasons to reject the relative optimism implicit to Netanyahu's plan.\n\nSenior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri derides Israeli efforts to rule Gaza as \"pointless\" and predicts they \"will never succeed.\" Former head of Israel's National Security Council Meir Ben Shabbat agrees, expecting that Hamas \"will clearly continue to be the dominant power in the Gaza Strip.\" The Economist newspaper concludes that Gaza will become \"another of the Middle East's failed states, broken but never rebuilt.\"\n\nThe following analysis supports the Netanyahu plan and its implicit optimism,[3] arguing for what I call a decent Gaza run by decent Gazans.[4] My hope rests on the fact that Gazans have endured something monstrous and possibly unique in human experience over the past fifteen years: exploitation by their rulers as cannon fodder for public relations. This means that, however anti-Zionist they may be, most Gazans despise Hamas and desperately want to move on, even if that means working with the Zionist enemy, and are ready to run a typical Middle East-style police state.\n\nThat \"monstrous and possibly unique experience\" lays the premise for anti-Hamas sentiments. Throughout history, dictators have seen their troops as expendable human drones replaceable with new conscripts. Russia's disregard of its Wagner prison recruits in the Battle of Bakhmut typifies this casual use of cheap manpower. It hardly mattered to Russia's President Vladimir Putin how much of his cannon fodder perished, so long as the front line moved forward. Battlefield gains justified any loss of life.\n\nThen there is Hamas, the jihadi organization that has ruled Gaza since 2007. For seventeen years, it has implemented an opposite and perhaps historically unique purpose: purposefully tormenting its subject population. Rather than sacrifice soldiers for battlefield gains, it sacrifices civilians for public relations purposes.\n\nHamas repeatedly attacks Israel to provoke retaliation, correctly expecting that the destruction and suffering in Gaza will bring support from antisemites and radicals of all persuasions, including Palestinian nationalists, Islamists, far-leftists, far-rightists, and sundry dictatorships. After Hamas attacks and Israel retaliates, blame for the violence quickly shifts from Hamas to Israel, to Hamas' benefit.[5] Perversely, the more misery endured by Gazans, the more convincingly can Hamas accuse Israel of aggression - and the wider and the more vehement its support.\n\nTo ensure that Gazan civilians will be rendered hungry, homeless, injured, and dead, Hamas bases troops and missiles in mosques, churches, schools, hospitals, and private homes. An Emirati political figure, Dirar Belhoul al-Falasi, explained in one case that \"Hamas fired a rocket from the hospital's roof, so that Israel would bomb this hospital.\" Hamas calls on Gazans to serve as human shields. It parks vehicles in the roads to block civilians from moving southwards and out of harm's way. It shoots would-be refugees.\n\nThe U.S. government has noted this pattern of behavior. In 2014, the diplomat Dennis Ross commented that Gazans paid a \"staggering\" price for Hamas' aggression but its leaders \"have never been concerned about that. For them, Palestinians' pain and suffering are tools to exploit, not conditions to end.\" Douglas Feith, a former high-ranking Pentagon official, correctly finds it \"unprecedented for a party to adopt a war strategy to maximize civilian deaths on its own side.\" He dubs this \"not a human shield strategy [but] a human sacrifice strategy.\"\n\nA trove of evidence-polling, demonstrations, and statements-suggests that Gazans understand this Hamas strategy and reject serving as its pawns in an obsessive and illusory jihad.\n\nFor starters, polling makes this evident. Fortunately, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy conducted an extensive poll of Gazans in July 2023. Its findings include:\n\nAn Arab Barometer survey of Gazans completed the day before Oct. 7 confirms these results, finding that\n\n\"Gazans were more likely to blame their material predicament on Hamas's leadership than on Israel's economic blockade. ... Overall, 73 percent of Gazans favored a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On the eve of Hamas's October 7 attack, just 20 percent of Gazans favored a military solution that could result in the destruction of the state of Israel.\"\n\nIts pollsters concluded that,\n\n\"rather than supporting Hamas, the vast majority of Gazans have been frustrated with the armed group's ineffective governance as they endure extreme economic hardship. Most Gazans do not align themselves with Hamas's ideology, either. Unlike Hamas, whose goal is to destroy the Israeli state, the majority of survey respondents favored a two-state solution with an independent Palestine and Israel existing side by side.\"\n\nAmaney Jamal of Princeton University, who participated in the Arab Barometer survey, estimates that 27 percent of Gazans would have voted for Hamas before Oct. 7. Gershon Baskin, a far-left Israeli with many connections in Gaza, agrees: the pre-Oct. 7 support for Hamas was well under 30 percent \"because in Gaza they have experienced 17 years of Hamas rule.\"\n\nAccording to a Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research poll conducted six weeks after Oct. 7, Gazan support for Hamas stands at 42 percent, a slight increase over the 38 percent three months earlier. In other words, the massacre did slightly increase backing for Hamas, but most Gazans reject it.\n\nPolling in Gaza's brutal environment may be vulnerable to manipulation; other manifestations confirm the anti-Hamas sentiment. Public demonstrations offer one vivid example.\n\nA video of hundreds of Gazans evacuated from the north to the south of Gaza shows them chanting \"Down with Hamas.\" Outside Deir al-Balah's Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, displaced northern Gazans demanded that Hamas release Israeli hostages, end the fighting, and make possible their return home. Children held white pieces of paper with \"Yes to giving back the hostages.\" Protesters shouted out:\n\n\"The people want to end the war! We put our trust in Allah, he is our best supporter! We don't want [food] coupons! We want to live! We want to go back home, to Beit Lahia! We want to go back home, to Al-Shati! We want to go back home, to Jabalia!\"\n\nVideos of a demonstration in Rafah show Gazans cursing Hamas and Yahya Sinwar. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Military Intelligence Directorate's Unit 504 has held tens of thousands telephone conversations with Gazans, urging civilians to evacuate combat areas. Along the way, it learns about local resistance to Hamas, as when locals chased Hamas away when it tried to take over their homes.\n\nThe issue of Hamas stealing humanitarian aid provokes high emotions.\n\nFurther reports indicate that \"Some Palestinians are openly challenging the authority of Hamas ... in scenes unimaginable just a month ago.\" Those scenes include:\n\nIn a live televised scene, a passerby disrupted a speech by a Hamas spokesman, brandishing his bandaged hand in the air and shouting \"May God hold you to account, Hamas!\" The much-shared clip of this incident led to Hamas issuing a public threat: \"We warn against publishing any pictures, videos or materials that are offensive to the image of the steadfastness and unity of our people in Gaza.\" To prevent protests, JNS reports, Hamas \"deployed security personnel to refugee centers, schools and other locations.\"\n\nIn all, Maj.-Gen. Rasan Aliyan, who heads the Israel Defense Forces' liaison office with Palestinians, noted \"more and more evidence of public criticism voiced by the residents of Gaza against the Hamas terrorist organization.\"[6]\n\nA survey of the press prompts the Gatestone Institute's Bassam Tawil to conclude that anti-Hamas Gazans \"have been almost completely ignored by mainstream media in the West.\" Arab media likewise \"has made it a habit of ignoring any Palestinian who dares to criticize Hamas.\" Still, dissident views come out.\n\nLive media interviews on Al Jazeera and other Arabic media that go awry inadvertently broadcast hatred of Hamas and its state backers.\n\nThey also publicize their views. An impassioned young Gazan man made an Internet video to criticize Hamas for neglecting the interests of Gaza's population, especially not having planned for the dire consequences of Oct. 7. Israeli intelligence Unit 504 gathers many such opinions about Hamas, such as: \"We're dying and they're saving themselves.\" The \"Voices of Gaza\" project of the Center for Peace Communications (CPC) collected bitter expressions from real-life Gazans.\n\nGazans living abroad can speak frankly, especially on the delicate topic of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the Oct. 7 mastermind. One exile says that Gazans \"were surprised\" by the attack and calls Sinwar \"a fool and a madman. ... We know that Hamas started this war, what Sinwar did was suicidal.\" In all, \"People are very tired of war. It's enough -- how much more? Enough.\" In a video of his interrogation by the Israeli government, Yousef al-Mansi, a former \"communications minister\" for Hamas criticized Sinwar: he \"feels like he is above everyone else\" and has \"delusions of grandeur.\" Further,\n\n\"People in the Gaza Strip say that Sinwar and his group destroyed us, we must get rid of them. ... I have not seen anyone in the Gaza Strip who supports Sinwar; nobody likes Sinwar. There are people who, day and night, pray that God will free us from him.\"\n\nIn all, he says, Hamas \"destroyed the Gaza Strip, set it back 200 years.\" Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Gaza's Al-Azhar University who fled Gaza, reports on \"a lot of criticism among Palestinians that the Oct. 7 attack -- the killing of Israeli civilians, women and children -- was a strategic mistake that provoked Israel into the current war.\" He predicts that. \"Once the war is over, you will hear more and more criticism against Hamas.\" Even a Gazan living in Gaza found the courage to spew venom against Sinwar:\n\n\"I want to convey my message to the Hamas government. May God take revenge on you [and] curse your forefathers. ... May God curse you, O Sinwar, you son of a dog. May God take revenge on you, you've destroyed us. ... Give the [Israeli] prisoners [back to Israel], these dogs who are in your possession. ... Sinwar is underground, hiding together with [Muhammad] Deif and all the other disgusting ones.\"\n\nAnother anti-Sinwar protestor called for a \"revolution of the hungry.\" Eventually whole crowds bellowed complaints against Sinwar and other Hamas leaders, reportedly leading to Hamas forces firing on the demonstrators.\n\nIn all, these many data points point to a solid majority of Gazans wanting liberation from the tyranny of Hamas. While few Gazans accept Israel and most adhere to the concept of \"resistance,\" Joseph Braude of CPC argues, \"a substantial majority oppose Hamas' brand of resistance -- that is, starting wars it can't win while hiding in bunkers and leaving civilians to suffer the consequences.\" Further, \"a large number of Gazans, while opposed to Israel, adopt a pragmatic outlook on cooperation if it delivers tangible benefit to them. These pragmatists, combined with the minority who believe in coexistence as a principle, constitute a solid base of support for any post-Hamas administration committed to reconstruction.\" Together, they \"show that a different, brighter, and more peaceful future is possible.\"\n\nDespite the high-profile pessimism about decent Gaza, this prospect finds solid support. Bassam Tawil finds that while \"many Palestinians continue to support Hamas,\" increasing numbers of them \"deplore what the Hamas terrorists did and who are willing to speak out.\" The CPC reports that its network in Gaza includes \"a critical mass of educators, intellectuals, and activists who oppose Hamas and support systemic change and development. ... The possibility of a brighter future for Gaza hinges on a smart plan to empower these and other Gazans who share the will to reach for it.\" West Bank human rights activist Bassam Eid hopes that \"Israel will very soon free Gaza from Hamas. After the war, the best thing to do is to give Gaza to its own people to rule.\" The clans in each of Gaza's five districts should take charge. \"Let those big tribes start ruling their own cities by themselves. ... Those tribes will provide a very good security to Israel.\"\n\nArab state leaders, one report finds, support a post-war Gaza ruled by \"neither Abbas nor Hamas.\" Abbas was told to stay away, Hamas told that \"Not one dollar will flow as long as you control the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nEven U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken endorsed something along these lines: \"We can't have a reversion to the status quo, with Hamas running Gaza. We also can't have ... Israel running or controlling Gaza. ... In between those ... are a variety of possible permutations that we're looking at very closely now.\" Blinken wants Israel to \"be a partner of the Palestinian leaders who are willing to lead their people and living side by side in peace with Israel.\" U.K Foreign Secretary James Cleverly agrees: \"As soon as practicable, a move towards a peace-loving Palestinian leadership is the most desired outcome\" in Gaza.\n\nMany Israelis are on board. Mordechai Kedar of Bar-Ilan University has long argued for Israel to deal with Palestinian clans. Contrasting the success of the United Arab Emirates, with its seven clans, with disasters in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Sudan, and Libya, he concludes that one clan per government offers \"the best way to establish a state in the Middle East.\" Such states, he finds, seek stability and prosperity, not foes. They have no need for \"an external enemy like Israel in order to galvanize all the groups into one nation.\" Member of Knesset Moshe Saada wants something similar: \"A local mukhtar [village elder] will rule civil life in each area. There will be no central government.\"\n\nShaul Bartal of the BESA Center foresees two stages after Israeli forces seize Gaza: \"a full Israeli military government\" and then \"the integration of local and regional forces, including military forces, into the newly formed government.\" He sees these made up of Palestinian, Egyptian, and other elements. Jonathan Rynhold and Toby Greene of Bar-Ilan University want Israel to plan \"how it can incorporate elements of the existing bureaucracy into a stable post-Hamas political order.\" Glen Segell of Haifa University hopes that \"educated and competent Palestinians\" will establish local committees that \"assume management of utilities such as water, electricity, education, and health together with the IDF.\" Natan Sharansky holds that only a free Palestinian society in which people \"enjoy a normal life, normal freedom, the opportunity to vote and have their own human rights\" can assure Israel's security. A poll found 21 percent of Israelis endorse such a Palestinian government.\n\nAmerican analysts concur. Robert Satloff of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy hopes that \"out of this crisis comes opportunity ... to make in Gaza a reasonably well-functioning administration that puts first the needs of its citizens, and not the ideology of its rulers.\" Former government officials Lewis Libby and Douglas J. Feith note that for the Gazans who oppose Hamas, the coming months will present an opportunity, for the outside world will eagerly assist \"Gazans who take a stand for a new, honest government that respects its people and favors peace through mutual compromise with Israel.\" Jeff Jacoby, a Boston Globe columnist, sees an Israeli administration \"explicitly committed to nourishing a healthy civil society\" as the best path to \"effective and peaceful self-rule.\"\n\nIsrael can reasonably expect to find a substantial cohort of Gazans ready to work with it to establish a new authority in Gaza that begins to return them to normal life. These Gazans will take on a wide range of tasks: policing, utilities, municipal services, administration, communications, teaching, urban planning, and so on.\n\nWhile this may sound like wishful thinking, it bears recalling that Gazans not that long ago led decent lives under Israeli rule. Gaza and the West Bank in the 1970s, recounts historian Efraim Karsh, \"constituted the fourth fastest-growing economy in the world -- ahead of such 'wonders' as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Korea, and substantially ahead of Israel itself.\" Medicine, electricity, schools, literacy -- all flourished. Gazans benefited from refrigerators, clean running water, and much else. Gazans are not immune to the charms of normal life.\n\nUnfortunately, Israel failed to cultivate relations with relatively friendly Gazans and lacked decent Gazan partners in its first period of rule, 1967-2005. Then, in an act of historic stupidity, it handed the territory to the genocidal Yasir Arafat. In a further mistake, it not only permitted the even more horrific Hamas to control Gaza after 2007 but encouraged external funders such as Qatar.\n\nCall the new entity the Revitalized Palestinian Authority if you like, but it must have no connection whatsoever to the execrable Palestinian Authority that rules parts of the West Bank. Nor should Arab or international bodies take part in its administration.\n\nDecent Gaza means tough Israeli military rule overseeing a tough police state along the lines of what exists in Egypt and Jordan, countries where one can lead a normal life so long as one stays out of trouble and never, ever criticizes the ruler. Gaza can become decent, not at war with its neighbor and economically viable. Will Israelis have the acumen and stamina to make this happen? Can they retrieve something positive out of tragedy?\n\nAbout the author: Daniel Pipes (DanielPipes.org, @DanielPipes) is president of the Middle East Forum and author of, most recently, Islamism vs. The West: 35 Years of Geopolitical Struggle (Wicked Son, 2023). \u00a9 2024 by Daniel Pipes.

They claim to have identified and arrested a man who was \"involved in financing terrorists.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin indicated a few days ago that he did not believe the Islamists had acted on their own. \"We care about who the customer is,\" he said. In addition, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it was difficult to imagine that the Islamic State would be capable of carrying out such an action, and the head of the FSB spoke on Tuesday that Western services supporting Ukraine also played a role role in the attack.\n\nKirby called it all \"nonsense and propaganda\" and said the United States had repeatedly warned Russian authorities about possible extremist attacks on concerts and rallies in Moscow, including in writing at 11:15 a.m. March 7.

        "body": "Vladimir Putin this month secured a new presidential term that means his leadership of Russia could continue until at least 2030. By then, he will have served as leader for a total of 26 years.\n\nHowever, his celebrations were cut short by the horrific attack in Moscow last weekend, which could have key implications for the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe attack, the worst case of terrorism in Moscow for about two decades, highlighted yet again the vulnerabilities of the Russian central state, especially while key security resources are diverted to Ukraine.\n\nThis was the second time in less than a year that this weakness has been exposed, following the Wagner mutiny last summer led by Yevgeny Prigozhin. What that episode revealed was the fissures that have developed within the elite of the security services and military intelligence over the trajectory of the war in Ukraine.\n\nAnother reason why last weekend's attack is important is that while Russia now appears to be in a significantly stronger position in Ukraine than it was last summer, the regime might still in fact be fragile. This is despite the extraordinary skills Putin has demonstrated in ensuring his political longevity over the past quarter of a century.\n\nPart of the reason why the tragic events of last weekend were a such blow to the regime is that they came so soon after Putin's election victory.\n\nThe attack in Moscow was carried out by a group of armed individuals who opened fire on concertgoers at the Crocus City Hall venue in northwestern Moscow. Responsibility was claimed by the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, a branch of the terror group Daesh operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It has been fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, which it regards as being insufficiently militant.\n\nAccording to some reports, greater numbers of foreign fighters have joined Daesh from former Soviet republics than any other region. Most of the perpetrators of last weekend's attack were apparently radicalized citizens of Tajikistan.\n\nDaesh has previously carried out wide-ranging attacks on Moscow's interests, including an incident in October 2015 when a Russian plane carrying 224 people exploded over Egypt, killing all on board. In 2017, an ISKP suicide bomber blew up a subway car in the St. Petersburg metro system. This month, Russia's Tass media agency reported that authorities had prevented an ISKP attack on a Moscow synagogue.\n\nThe attack last weekend, which resulted in the deaths of at least 137 people, raises troubling questions about the ability of the Russian security apparatus to prevent such deadly incidents. This is especially true, given that Western security services had issued warnings of a threat about two weeks prior.\n\nRussian special forces are thin on the ground at home, and even some police officers have been deployed to the front lines in Ukraine. This seemingly allowed a relatively small number of terrorists to cause deadly chaos for a significant period of time; it reportedly took National Guard troops more than an hour to arrive from their base only about two miles away.\n\nISKP has released information on social media about the relatively small number of men it said were involved in the attack, along with details of how they planned and executed it.\n\nPutin has linked the activities with Kyiv, saying the terrorists \"tried to hide and moved toward Ukraine where, previously, a window had been prepared for them to cross the border.\" He also described the attackers as \"Nazis,\" his oft-used codename for Ukrainians.\n\nAt least part of the Kremlin's motivation for apportioning blame to Kyiv could be an attempt to divert attention and avoid difficult questions about why Russia's security services failed to take more seriously the advance warnings from the West of an imminent attack.\n\nHowever, there is also a significant possibility that Putin will use it to double down on the Russian war effort in Ukraine, with potentially key economic, and not just political, implications.\n\nEven before the attack, there were signs of Russia shifting gears in Ukraine. For instance, the Kremlin for the first time declared Russia was involved in a \"de facto war\" with Ukraine, rather than carrying out a \"special military operation,\" as had been its previous stance.\n\nThe commander of Ukraine's ground forces, Lt. Gen. Oleksandr Pavliuk, warned last week that Moscow plans to assemble a force of 100,000 troops for a possible new offensive. This follows a period of sustained Russian battlefield gains, including in the city of Avdiivka in February, which has been fueled in part by lack of weapons supplies to Kyiv from Western allies.\n\nPresuming the Russian war effort continues apace, the most likely scenario in the coming weeks is a continued war of attrition. However, one key difference now compared with the spring of 2023 is that Moscow is making gains on the ground, rather than Ukraine.\n\nStill, attrition seems the most likely scenario while both sides are prepared to expend massive resources, albeit Ukraine's ability to match Russia in this aspect will depend on an increase in Western financial support this year.\n\nWhile a war of attrition might imply a degree of stability in the conflict, this is not necessarily the case, and the level and range of risks actually remain very high. This is one reason why the outcome of the war is still so unpredictable.\n\nIn the context of VUCA (an established theory about the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous nature of conditions and situations), there might well be further significant \"surprises\" in the coming weeks. This includes the possibility of major nuclear incidents of some kind, possibly \"accidents\" at nuclear energy sites.\n\nSo the conflict will probably continue for many more months, at least. Even in the most positive scenario for peace, in which major fighting ends this year or next, periodic tensions between Russia and Ukraine will probably continue for much longer.",

        "body": "According to Al Jazeera reports: Ukraine launched a devastating missile strike against Russian military targets in the Crimean port of Sevastopol late on Saturday, further debilitating Russia's Black Sea Fleet.\n\nThe combination of a reported 40 Storm Shadow missiles, decoy missiles and drones damaged a communications centre, the Yamal and the Azov, two Ropucha-class landing ships, and other infrastructure, possibly including an oil depot.\n\nThe Yamal was especially badly damaged. Ukrainian military intelligence said it was listing to starboard with a large hole in its top deck two days later, and Russian crews had to keep pumping its bilges to keep the ship afloat. The damage to the Yamal and the Azov reportedly left Russia with just three of its landing ships operational, from an original fleet of 13 at the start of the war.\n\nUkrainian military intelligence coordinated a seaborne attack using Ukrainian Magura V5 surface drones to coincide with the aerial attack. The surface drones also struck the repair yard where the Yamal was moored, said deputy military intelligence chief Vadym Skibitskyi, and additionally damaged the Ivan Khurs reconnaissance ship.\n\nApart from the moral satisfaction of putting the Yamal out of action - it had taken part in the capture of Crimea in 2014 - Ukraine had a practical benefit.\n\nSevastopol is reportedly the only Black Sea facility capable of loading Kalibr ballistic missiles onto Russian submarines and ships, and strikes on the port have reduced the number of vessels carrying these missiles, which are particularly difficult to intercept.\n\nUkraine's attack came a day after Russia launched a massive aerial attack on energy and other infrastructure in Ukraine, using 151 drones and missiles launched from both Russia and occupied Crimea.\n\nUkraine's General Staff said their defences shot down 55 of the 63 Shahed drones used and 37 of the 88 missiles of various types. The remainder caused power and water outages that Ukrainian authorities said were later restored.\n\n\"Russian strikes on energy infrastructure ... likely aim to collapse the energy grid in part to stall Ukrainian efforts to rapidly expand its [defence industrial base],\" said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nRussia falls down on security at home\n\nRussian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure have also aimed to undermine Ukrainians' sense of security and support for the war.\n\nBut on the day of Russia's large-scale strike, it was Russian insecurity that was heightened. Four gunmen massacred at least 133 Russian civilians at the Crocus City Hall concert hall on the outskirts of Moscow. The Islamic State in Khorasan, a Taliban splinter group, later claimed responsibility.\n\nEven so, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other public figures attempted to blame Ukraine for the attack.\n\n\"Who benefits from this?\" asked Putin in a televised address on Monday. \"This atrocity may be only a link in a whole series of attempts by those who have been fighting our country since 2014 at the hands of the neo-Nazi Kyiv regime. And the Nazis, as is well known, never disdained to use the most dirty and inhumane means to achieve their goals,\" Putin said.\n\nRussian authorities arrested four Tajik nationals they said were trying to escape to Ukraine in a van with a Ukrainian numberplate.\n\nThe explanation did not travel well outside Russia.\n\nBelarus President Alexander Lukashenko said the van was possibly headed for his country as they were arrested on Russian territory adjacent to Belarus.\n\nThe US embassy in Moscow had issued a warning to avoid large gatherings on March 7, and Washington said its intelligence agencies had followed a duty to warn policy, passing on intelligence directly to Russian authorities.\n\nPutin dismissed these and other warnings as \"outright blackmail\" and \"an attempt to intimidate and destabilise our society\" three days before the attack - meaning the failure to respond to intelligence came from the top.\n\n\"The terrorists' car was stopped near Bryansk, which is in western Russia, and so vaguely near Ukraine, which means that the four Tajiks in a Renault were intending to cross the Ukrainian border, which means that they had Ukrainian backers, which means that it was a Ukrainian operation, which means that the Americans were behind it,\" wrote Yale University history professor Timothy Snyder.\n\n\"The reasoning here leaves something to be desired. And the series of associations rests on no factual basis.\"\n\nRussians gunning for Chasiv Yar\n\nRussian forces continued to make minor advances in Ukraine's east during the past week.\n\nThey have taken the offensive initiative this year, and have been inching forward since the fall of Avdiivka on February 17.\n\nOn March 20, Ukrainian forces said they repelled a \"massive\" attack at the northern end of the front in Kharkiv that thrust towards Lyman. The assault left the Russian positions marginally ahead of where they had been a day earlier.\n\nFurther south, in the Donetsk region, Russian forces seemed to fix their sights on Chasiv Yar, west of Bakhmut, which fell last May. During the week they appeared to gradually swallow two settlements, Bohdanivka and Ivanivske, which lie northeast and southeast of Chasiv Yar, respectively.\n\nSeizing Chasiv Yar \"would be more operationally significant than the Russian seizure of Avdiivka\", said the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nFor a start, it would mean Ukrainian forces could no longer harass Russian logistics convoys in occupied territory east of Bakhmut and would have to bring artillery into harm's way to disrupt Russian logistics closer to the front lines.\n\nMore importantly, Chasiv Yar would bring Russian forces much closer to their objective of capturing the last major urban centres of Donetsk - Konstyantynivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk - said the ISW.\n\n\"Available imagery, which ISW will not present or describe in greater detail at this time to preserve Ukrainian operational security, shows that Ukrainian forces have established significant fortifications in a ring shape in the Chasiv Yar area, and Russian forces will likely struggle to break through these defences at their current offensive tempo in the area,\" said the ISW.",

        "body": "In some ways, last week's horrific attack on the Crocus City Hall concert venue in a Moscow suburb, apparently by Islamist extremists, was reminiscent of terror attacks in other countries -- above all, the 2015 Bataclan theatre massacre in Paris. But the differences are far more startling -- and they are a stark reminder that Russia in 2024 is not only a brutally authoritarian state but one that is terrifyingly lawless and caught up in the fake reality of its own propaganda.\n\nOn March 22, just before the start of a sold-out concert by a popular rock band, four masked gunmen in military fatigues entered the building. Concertgoers were shot with Kalashnikov rifles. Explosives were set off, causing dozens of people who sought refuge in bathrooms to suffocate from the smoke. The death toll now stands at 143, with more than 350 injured. ISIS-K, a branch of the Islamic State terrorist army, has taken responsibility for the attack; the actual alleged perpetrators were migrants from Tajikistan, apparently recruited online.\n\nAmong independent Russian commentators -- these days, mostly in exile -- a question foremost on many people's minds was: How does this kind of attack, which required extensive planning, happen in a police state where surveillance is pervasive? Were security agencies too busy hunting down anti-war protesters and gay rights activists?\n\nThe question is all the more baffling because the United States warned Russia about an impending ISIS attack, based on clues picked up by intelligence. Just three days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed those warnings in a public televised meeting with security officials as an attempt at intimidation.\n\nIn a democracy, a president who dropped the ball that badly would likely have faced calls for resignation, or at least for major explanations. Of course, nothing of the sort has happened in Russia, where some of Putin's propagandists are claiming that the warning is a clue the U.S., along with Ukraine, is party to the attack.\n\nAlmost from the start, Russian officials, including Putin himself, started talking about a \"Ukrainian footprint\" while producing no evidence other than the fact that the four suspects may have been headed toward the Ukrainian border when they were apprehended. Yet Russia-friendly Belarusian authorities have said that the suspects were planning to cross into Belarus, not Ukraine.\n\nThe propagandists' calls for vengeance divert attention from the fact that Russia's security services and law enforcement have been horrendously incompetent (unless one believes, as some do, that they deliberately staged the attack as a false flag operation). The police delay in storming the building almost certainly exacerbated the death toll: Paramedics and firefighters had to wait for about an hour and a half to go in. Given the speed with which anti-war protesters usually get arrested, some dissident commentators have made the grim joke that perhaps survivors in the building should have tried chanting \"Stop the war\" -- then the cops would have charged in right away.\n\nWhile the alleged terrorists weren't stopped in advance, they were, apparently, beaten and tortured after their capture; video clips of the torture soon turned up, and the four men's battered and bloodied look in the courtroom told the rest of the story.\n\nThere's a common view that most Russians support Putin's autocracy because they like a \"strong hand\" at the helm of the state. Now, it turns out that the \"strong hand\" offers no protection -- only savage retribution toward alleged culprits and conspiracy theories blaming the regime's enemies.",

        "body": "President Biden will have an entourage of support from celebrities and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at a historic campaign fundraiser set to raise more than $25 million Thursday night, as Biden continues to aggressively campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe event at Radio City Music Hall in New York is meant to reinforce Biden's campaign finances and widen his voter outreach.\n\nBiden already has a commanding lead over Trump in campaign finances, especially as Trump and his groups are figuring out how to cover Trump's legal costs. But Biden and Democrats aren't holding back to increase that gap: By mid March, Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee amassed a combined $155 million cash on hand, while the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee ended February with $44.85 million cash on hand. Since Super Tuesday, the Biden campaign has outspent the Trump team on pre-booked advertising by nearly four times.\n\n\"This historic raise is a show of strong enthusiasm for President Biden and Vice President Harris and a testament to the unprecedented fundraising machine we've built,\" said Biden-Harris 2024 campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nObama and Clinton uniting forces behind Biden could help the incumbent weather the unique political challenges that his predecessors -- who both had higher approval ratings than Biden during their reelection campaigns -- did not have to face: the aftermath of a worldwide pandemic, the Jan. 6 insurrection, turmoil over abortion access, and a growing protest vote campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nA star-studded cast will also appear with the former presidents and Biden, including Mindy Kaling, Ben Platt and Stephen Colbert hosting the event.\n\nIt's an opportunity for Biden to counter concerns about his age and polls that show a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nThe Trump campaign notes that Biden hasn't had to spend money fending off primary challengers, like Trump has. The Trump campaign also is just now getting access to the Republican National Committee support since officially securing the nomination.\n\n\"Our digital online fundraising continues to skyrocket, our major donor investments are climbing, and Democrats are running scared of the fundraising prowess of President Trump,\" said Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung.\n\nAnother challenge for Trump, though, are his mounting legal fees, which his political action committee is spending money on.\n\nKatzenberg took a swipe at that fact, and said Biden is focused on demonstrating his track record to voters.\n\n\"Unlike our opponent, every dollar we're raising is going to reach the voters who will decide this election -- communicating the President's historic record, his vision for the future and laying plain the stakes of this election.\"\n\nThe money race isn't anywhere near over. Trump and the Republican Party have a fundraiser next week that they say will overshadow Biden's event by raising at least $33 million.",

The extensive document reveals Washington's priorities in instituting online censorship and combating so-called \"fake news\" in the post-Trump, post-Brexit era.But \"much of the organization's focus appears to be on preventing individuals from finding information online that challenges official narratives and leads to increased questioning of the system more generally,\" says journalist Alan MacLeod in an analysis published by MintPress News.Anthropologist Adrienne Pine joined Sputnik's Political Misfits program Thursday to discuss the article and shed light on one of the United States' most underhanded tools of global subversion.\"USAID's focus relates to \"misinformation, disinformation and mal-information,\" notes host Michelle Witte, referring to terms which are employed frequently by so-called experts in the field. \"Malinformation\" has proven to be perhaps the most controversial among the three, referring to factually true information presented in a way to allegedly harm or manipulate.Malinformation may lead people towards inconvenient narratives for those in power such as the conclusion that Israeli ethnic cleansing is bad or the Iraq War wasn't about \"spreading democracy.\"\"Experts have described this phenomenon as an information disorder, a condition in which the truth and facts coexist in a milieu of misinformation and disinformation - like conspiracy theories, lies, propaganda and half-truths,\" explained Witte. \"Which I will stop and say describes every press briefing by a White House press secretary or John Kirby for the State Department or whoever.\"The tactic was recently employed by establishment mouthpiece The New York Times in an article about the anti-war group Code Pink that was widely slammed as McCarthyist in its tone. McCarthyism refers to disgraced former US Senator Joseph McCarthy's Cold War tactic of smearing opponents by accusing them of association with communism or Soviet Russia.Pine explained the Cold War origins of USAID as a tool of US \"soft power.\" The organization was created around the same time as other government agencies such as the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress, \"a US imperialist program aimed at preventing revolutions in Latin America,\" she noted.USAID operates by funding \"civil society\" groups purportedly focused on \"democracy promotion,\" labor rights, strengthening \"independent media,\" and other anodyne causes. But covert influence, as well as such groups' desire to maintain US funding, transforms them into tools of US foreign policy.Such non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can play a role in strengthening opposition to movements and figures perceived to work against US interests. In more extreme cases these groups promote civil unrest that creates a fertile environment for US-backed regime change. These efforts are known as \"color revolutions\" and have taken place in such countries as Bolivia in 2019 and Ukraine in 2004 and 2014.Witte slammed the \"hypocrisy\" of the tactic given the US fixation on the conspiracy theory that Russia altered the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The host called USAID's efforts \"profoundly anti-democratic, because it's the notion that the United States can fund organizations that are against governments that the United States doesn't like, in lieu of the democratic processes that those governments and those people would like to set up.\"Pine noted the USAID document, in addition to smearing alternative news outlets like the Ron Paul Institute, Black Agenda Report and Truthout, also attempts to promote US intelligence-linked sources like the Atlantic Council and Bellingcat.The Atlantic Council is a NATO offshoot created by the US defense department, MacLeod's article notes, with seven former CIA chiefs on its board. Bellingcat, which presents itself as an independent \"open source\" intelligence operation, receives grants from the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and other Western government agencies.",

        "body": "The federal three-judge panel acknowledged the \"unusual\" nature of its decision to reinstate a map that it found to have moved 30,000 Black residents out of a congressional district based on their race in violation of their constitutional rights. Freighter pilot called for tugboat help before plowing into Baltimore bridge The pilot of the cargo freighter that knocked down a highway bridge into Baltimore Harbor had radioed for tugboat help and reported a power loss minutes earlier, federal safety officials said on Wednesday, citing audio from the ship's \"black box\" data recorder.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current US domestic news briefs.\n\nA million solar eclipse enthusiasts expected at Niagara Falls\n\nFrom vintage train rides costing almost $4,000 per person to hotel rooms listed at $1,600 a night, businesses in and around majestic Niagara Falls are preparing to cash in on the April 8 total solar eclipse - with around a million visitors expected. The dramatic waterfall, situated along the Canadian-U.S. border, is in the path of the eclipse, and many people are splurging on hotels and rentals in advance to experience the phenomenon at one of North America's natural wonders. Demand has pushed up prices of hotels as people making last-minute plans book the last of the available accommodations.\n\nWhite House issues new federal standards to collect data on race\n\nThe White House on Thursday announced new standards for collecting federal data on race and ethnicity, a decision that will touch organizations that receive federal funding, determine how congressional districts are drawn and whether equal employment policies can be enforced. The standards from the White House's Office of Management & Budget (OMB)- revised for the first time since 1997- requires federal agencies to use one combined question for race and ethnicity, encourages respondents to select multiple options on how they identify and adds Middle Eastern or North African as a new identification category.\n\nUS gives Maryland $60 million to rebuild collapsed Baltimore bridge\n\nThe U.S. government awarded the state of Maryland $60 million in federal emergency relief on Thursday in response to the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, an extraordinarily fast disbursement after such a disaster. The bridge came tumbling down early on Tuesday after a massive cargo freighter that had lost power plowed into the structure in Baltimore Harbor. Two bodies have been recovered and four other missing people are presumed dead.\n\nTexas judge transfers lawsuit over card fees to Washington, D.C\n\nA federal judge in a Texas court that has become a favorite for conservative challenges to Biden administration policies transferred a lawsuit challenging a rule curbing credit card late fees to a court in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman said half of the business groups that sued are based in Washington, as are most of the lawyers representing them and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which wrote the rule the groups are seeking to block.\n\nBiden's campaign war chest exceeds Trump's before major fundraising event\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's campaign has pulled in more money ahead of November's election than that of his Republican rival Donald Trump, which analysts attribute to Biden's incumbent status and support from Democratic predecessors. That support will be on full display Thursday at a fundraising event for Biden in New York City, where former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, both prominent Democrats, will be in attendance.\n\nSouth Carolina voting map faulted for racial bias by court revived for 2024\n\nA federal court that previously threw out a Republican-drawn South Carolina electoral map for bias against Black voters decided on Thursday that it can be used in this year's congressional elections, a ruling that could undercut Democratic chances of winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives. The federal three-judge panel acknowledged the \"unusual\" nature of its decision to reinstate a map that it found to have moved 30,000 Black residents out of a congressional district based on their race in violation of their constitutional rights.\n\nFreighter pilot called for tugboat help before plowing into Baltimore bridge\n\nThe pilot of the cargo freighter that knocked down a highway bridge into Baltimore Harbor had radioed for tugboat help and reported a power loss minutes earlier, federal safety officials said on Wednesday, citing audio from the ship's \"black box\" data recorder. The head of the National Transportation Safety Board also said that Francis Scott Key Bridge, a traffic artery over the harbor built in 1976, lacked structural engineering redundancies common to newer spans, making it more vulnerable to a catastrophic collapse.\n\nImmigrants killed in Baltimore bridge collapse died doing job 'others do not want to do'\n\nThey came to the United States for a chance at a better life. They found work filling pot holes on a bridge in the middle of the night, and they ended up dead in the Baltimore harbor. The six victims of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse were all immigrants from Mexico and Central America, doing the kind of grueling work that many immigrants take on, when a container ship crashed into a support pillar at 1:30 a.m. EST on Tuesday and sent them plunging into the icy Patapsco River.\n\nUS House to deliver Homeland Secretary Mayorkas impeachment to Senate April 10\n\nThe Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will deliver two articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate on April 10, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Thursday. Mayorkas, who Republicans blame for record flows of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border, was narrowly impeached by the House last month on allegations that he has not enforced U.S. immigration laws and has made false statements to Congress.\n\nTrump can't match Biden's 2024 fundraising, Republican's campaign says\n\nDonald Trump will be unable to match President Joe Biden's fundraising totals in this year's presidential election race, the Republican candidate's campaign said on Thursday. \"We're never gonna be able to raise dollar for dollar with Biden,\" a Trump campaign adviser said in a call with reporters.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "body": "(Reuters) - A federal judge in a Texas court that has become a favorite for conservative challenges to Biden administration policies transferred a lawsuit challenging a rule curbing credit card late fees to a court in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Pittman said half of the business groups that sued are based in Washington, as are most of the lawyers representing them and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which wrote the rule the groups are seeking to block.\n\nThe CFPB had asked the judge to transfer the case, as no card issuer subject to the rule is based in Fort Worth.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sued with five other groups, countered that potentially affected cardholders reside there.\n\nPittman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, rejected that argument on Thursday, saying it would allow the lawsuit to be filed anywhere in the country, instead of where the underlying events occurred.\n\n\"Venue is not a continental breakfast; you cannot pick and choose on a plaintiffs' whim where and how a lawsuit is filed,\" Pittman said.\n\nSpokespeople for the CFPB and Chamber of Commerce did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe groups had urged Pittman to block the rule, which is set to take effect in May, while the lawsuit plays out, arguing that in order to make changes that may be necessary, they will need to send out notices to consumers starting on Friday. They have asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review Pittman's decision not to expedite the case.\n\nThe rule deals with what the CFPB has called \"excessive\" fees credit card issuers charge for late payments, something the consumer protection agency estimated costs consumers $12 billion a year.\n\nUnder that rule, credit card issuers with more than 1 million open accounts can only charge $8 for late fees, unless they can prove higher fees are necessary to cover their costs. The previous rule allowed issuers to charge up to $30 or $41 for subsequent late payments.\n\nPittman, one of two active federal judges in Fort Worth, had raised concerns about whether the lawsuit belonged in his court after the federal court administrators announced a new policy aimed at curbing \"judge shopping.\"\n\nThe Fort Worth courthouse has become a popular destination for conservative litigants and business groups challenging the policies of President Joe Biden's administration, including on student debt, guns and LGBTQ rights.\n\nPittman said Thursday several factors supported transferring the credit card case, including that his court is busier than the one in Washington, and that taxpayers would pay for CFPB lawyers to travel to Texas.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Donald Trump will be unable to match President Joe Biden's fundraising totals in this year's presidential election race, the Republican candidate's campaign said on Thursday.\n\n\"We're never gonna be able to raise dollar for dollar with Biden,\" a Trump campaign adviser said in a call with reporters.\n\nThe adviser blamed the fundraising disparity on \"billionaire\" supporters of the Democratic president, and appeared keen to paint a picture of a Trump campaign fueled by grassroots, working-class supporters.\n\nA second campaign adviser said Trump's campaign is \"fueled by hundreds of thousands of grassroots contributors across the country, and I'd much rather have that because each one of those votes.\"\n\nAsked for a response, Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said: \"Trump's campaign is strapped for cash.\"\n\nDemocratic candidates have raised more money in support of their White House bids than their Republican counterparts in all election cycles after 2004. Money, however is not always an indication of success; Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 even though she raised far more cash than he did.\n\nBiden has been routinely outraising former President Trump, whose campaign, together with a joint fundraising committee, pulled in $20.3 million in February compared with the more than $53 million raised by Biden's reelection effort that month.\n\nLarge contributions make up about 55% of the $128.7 million that Biden's campaign committee has raised so far in the election cycle, OpenSecrets data showed, compared with 45% from small contributions.\n\nFor Trump, large contributions comprise 64% of the $96.1 million his campaign committee has raised, versus 36% from small contributions.\n\nThe two face a Nov. 5 general election rematch, in a race that opinion polls suggest will be extremely close.\n\nBiden was holding a star-studded fundraiser in New York on Thursday night with his Democratic predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton that his campaign said has already raised $25 million.\n\nThe Trump campaign is due to hold a fundraiser on April 6 hosted by billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson in south Florida that aims to bring in $33 million, according to a person familiar with the event.\n\nThe Trump advisers on Thursday said that together with the Republican National Committee, the campaign will be opening dozens of offices and hiring hundreds of staff in the next few weeks, as they ramp up their general election infrastructure now that Trump has become the Republican Party's presidential candidate.\n\nTrump cemented his grip over the RNC in March when a loyalist, his daughter-in-law, and a senior campaign adviser were installed as chair, co-chair and chief of staff of the organization following his endorsement. An aggressive overhaul ensued, with dozens of employees losing their jobs.\n\nAs part of the leadership restructuring, a new slate of deputies will focus on battleground states as well as relationships with state parties and grassroots organizations, the second Trump campaign adviser said. Gone are regional directors who oversaw broad areas of the country.\n\n\"Folks that are focused on the battleground states will have a very narrow focus,\" the adviser said. \"We will not have that sort of middle layer that has historically existed to oversee a large region.\"\n\n(Reporting by Tim Reid and Nathan Layne; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Leslie Adler)",

Trump has accused Biden of lacking toughness and his campaign sought to contrast his visit with Biden's fundraiser.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, noted Trump's visit and said, \"Meanwhile, the Three Stooges -- Biden, Obama, and Clinton -- will be at a glitzy fundraiser in the city with their elitist, out-of-touch celebrity benefactors.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that the president has spoken with New York City's mayor, but she said she didn't have any \"private communications to share\" when asked if Biden had spoken to the family of the officer who was killed. Jean-Pierre said the administration's hearts go out to the officer's family.\n\nSpeaking aboard Air Force One, she said Biden has supported law enforcement throughout his entire career and took a dig at Trump's record. \"Violent crime surged under the previous administration,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"The Biden-Harris administration have done the polar opposite, taking decisive action from the very beginning to fund the police and achieving a historic reduction in crime.\"\n\nAfter visiting in the funeral home with Diller's family, Trump spoke outside to news reporters with about a dozen local police officers, half in patrol uniforms, half in tactical gear, forming as a backdrop behind him. One officer standing in front held his rifle across his chest.\n\nYou might be interested in\n\nBreaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star\n\nDec 31, 1969 Breaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star\n\nDec 31, 1969\n\nTrump called Diller's killing \"such a sad, sad event, such a horrible thing.\"\n\n\"The police are the greatest people we have. There's nothing and there's nobody like them. And this should never happen,\" Trump said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe spoke about Diller's wife and young son, saying he \"doesn't know how his life has been changed.\"\n\n\"We have to get back to law and order. We have to do a lot of things differently. This is not working. This is happening too often,\" Trump said.\n\nAfter his brief remarks, he repeated himself as he walked away toward his motorcade and added: \"We've got to toughen it up.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate.\n\nTrump has deplored crime in heavily Democratic cities, called for shoplifters to be shot immediately and wants to immunize police officers from lawsuits for potential misconduct. But he's also demonized local prosecutors, the FBI and the Department of Justice over the criminal prosecutions he faces and the investigation while he was president into his first campaign's interactions with Russia.\n\nHe has also embraced those imprisoned for their roles on the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, when a mob of his angry supporters overran police lines and Capitol and local police officers were attacked and beaten.\n\nMassapequa and the surrounding South Shore towns have long been a popular destination for city police officers and firefighters looking to set down roots on Long Island. The road leading to the funeral home was painted with a thin blue line, a symbol used as a sign of police solidarity, and the road was flanked by American flags and American flags with a thin blue line.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nParked nearby were two pickup trucks with pro-Trump decals and flags bearing his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Dozens of supporters wearing Trump paraphernalia stood nearby in pouring rain.\n\nThough Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York, this area is a heavily Republican part of Long Island that Trump won in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nNassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican, accompanied Trump and told reporters it was \"a tremendous comfort to the family\" to have Trump visit.\n\nInside the funeral home, Trump spent more than 10 minutes meeting privately with Diller's wife, Stephanie, before joining her in the main viewing room and saying a prayer over the officer's casket, Blakeman said later.\n\nTrump then met with the rest of the family, giving his condolences to Diller's mother, siblings, aunts and uncles, he said. Diller's grandmother asked the former president for a hug and the family also asked him to write a note on a mass card.\n\n\"It was a really good, warm conversation,\" Blakeman said. \"It was all talking about Jon and what kind of person he was as a father, son, husband. It was not about public policy or anything like that.\"\n\nThe former president and his supporters sought a similar split screen with Biden earlier this month as they went after the president over crime and illegal immigration while both were campaigning in Georgia. Trump during his visit to the state met with the family of slain nursing student Laken Riley. An immigrant from Venezuela who entered the U.S. illegally is charged with her death.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump posted about Diller's death on his social media network Tuesday, offering prayers to Diller's family and appreciation for law enforcement. He also called the shooter a \"thug\" and noted that police said the shooter had numerous prior arrests, declaring that he \"NEVER should have been let back out on the streets.\"\n\nOn Thursday, prosecutors in Queens charged the alleged shooter, Guy Rivera, with first degree murder and other charges. Rivera, who was shot in the back when Diller's partner returned fire, was arraigned from his hospital bed. Rivera's lawyers at Legal Aid declined to comment, according to spokesman Redmond Haskins.\n\nDiller was the first New York City police officer killed in the line of duty in two years.\n\nThe previous line-of-duty deaths were the fatal shootings of two New York City police officers, and the day after the second funeral, Biden visited the police department's headquarters and spoke to officers and top brass.\n\nBiden has pledged that the federal government will work more closely with police to combat gun violence and crack down on illegal guns.\n\nNew FBI statistics related earlier this month showed that overall violent crime in the U.S. dropped again last year, continuing a downward trend after a pandemic-era spike. The FBI data found murders dropped 13% in the last three months of 2023 compared with the same period the year before, and violent crime overall was down 6%.\n\nThe FBI's report was in line with the findings of the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice, which found that homicides were down an average of 10% from the year before in a survey of 32 cities, though it found violent crime still remained higher than before the coronavirus pandemic in many cities.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nPrice reported from New York.

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans on Thursday invited President Biden to testify before Congress in what appears to be a last-ditch effort to deliver on their stalled monthslong impeachment inquiry into the Biden family businesses.\n\nRep. James Comer, R-Ky., speaks during a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing on March 20. Jose Luis Magana/Associated Press\n\nRep. James Comer, chair of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to the Democratic president, inviting him to sit for a public hearing to \"explain, under oath,\" what involvement he had in the Biden family businesses. So far, the GOP-led inquiry has not produced hard evidence of wrongdoing while Biden was in public office.\n\n\"In light of the yawning gap between your public statements and the evidence assembled by the Committee, as well as the White House's obstruction, it is in the best interest of the American people for you to answer questions from Members of Congress directly, and I hereby invite you to do so,\" the Kentucky Republican wrote.\n\nWhile it is highly unlikely that Biden would agree to appear before lawmakers in such a setting, Comer pointed to previous examples of presidents' testifying before Congress.\n\n\"As you are aware, presidents before you have provided testimony to congressional committees, including President Ford's testimony before the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974,\" Comer continued.\n\nThe invitation comes as the monthslong inquiry into Biden is all but winding down, as Republicans face the stark reality that it lacks the political appetite from within the conference to go forward with an actual impeachment. Nonetheless, leaders of the effort, including Comer, are facing growing political pressure to deliver something after months of work investigating the Biden family and its web of international business transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House has repeatedly called the inquiry baseless, telling Republicans to \"move on\" and focus on \"real issues\" that Americans want addressed.\n\n\"This is a sad stunt at the end of a dead impeachment,\" White House spokesman Ian Sams said in a social media post last week. \"Call it a day, pal.\"\n\nThe committee has asserted for the past year that the Bidens traded on the family name - an alleged influence-peddling scheme in which Republicans are trying to link a handful of phone calls or dinner meetings between Joe Biden, when he was vice president or out of office, and his son Hunter Biden and his business associates.\n\nBut despite dedicating countless resources and interviewing dozens of witnesses, including Hunter Biden and the president's brother James Biden, Republicans have yet to produce any evidence that shows Joe Biden was directly involved or benefited from his family's businesses while in public office.\n\nDemocrats have remained unified against the inquiry, with Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, calling for his Republican counterpart to end the investigation absent any credible evidence.\n\n\"The GOP impeachment inquiry has been a circus,\" Oversight Democrats wrote on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. \"Time to fold up the tent.\"\n\nSeeking testimony from the president could ultimately be the inquiry's final act. Late last year, Republicans leading the investigation had privately discussed holding a vote on articles of impeachment in the new year, but growing criticism from within their party forced a shift in strategy. Now, Comer is eyeing potential criminal referrals of the family to the Justice Department, a move that would be largely symbolic and unlikely to be taken up by the department.\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

        "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A local official in a rural Northern California survived a recall attempt spurred in part by his effort to get rid of the county's vote-counting machines following unfounded accusations of fraud amplified by former President Donald Trump.\n\nKevin Crye was elected to the Shasta County Board of Supervisors in 2022. He and two other supervisors then voted to get rid of the county's vote-counting machines, directing local officials to hand count ballots. The machines were made by Dominion Voting Systems, the company at the center of debunked conspiracy theories of how Trump lost the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe decision divided the community and prompted a group of residents to file a recall petition to remove Crye from office a little over one year into his four-year term. That effort failed by just 50 votes out of more than 9,300 ballots cast, according to official results that were certified on Thursday by the Shasta County Registrar of Voters more than three weeks after Election Day. Crye won his seat in 2022 by just 90 votes.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Assistant Registrar of Voters Joanna Francescut said they did that because the race was so close and they wanted to increase the community's confidence in the accuracy of the results. She said the hand count resulted in only one discrepancy, where the machine did not count a ballot that had not been completely filled in. Elections officials ended up counting that ballot, which did not change the outcome of the race.\n\nNow that the results have been certified, Francescut said voters have five days to request a recount in any election. Voters who do request a recount would have to pay for it.\n\nThe committee behind the effort to recall Crye has not decided if it will request a recount, according to spokesperson Dana Silberstein.\n\nWhile Crye will stay in office, one of his allies on the board will not. Patrick Jones, a supervisor who also voted to get rid of the vote-counting machines and was running for reelection, was defeated by business owner Matt Plummer.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "body": "The Biden campaign once again has proven that it has a messaging problem. \"Bidenomics is great!\" Fail. \"Republicans are responsible for the border crisis!\" Nobody bought that either. \"Democracy is under attack!\" That's lost its punch. Well, they are still trying, and this latest attempt is quite a doozy.\n\nWould you believe that the Biden campaign is accusing Donald Trump of hiding in his basement?\n\nIt's true.\n\nOn Thursday, Joe Biden's X/Twitter account posted a video boasting about how he's visited eight swing states in just over two weeks, while accusing Trump of just playing golf the entire time.\n\nAnother post by the Biden-Harris campaign takes a far more juvenile approach, showing a mock schedule that includes three entries that read \"hide in basement.\"\n\nDid anyone at the Biden campaign think this through at all? Do they think we don't remember how Joe Biden literally campaigned from his basement in 2020?\n\nBut, that's not even the worst part of it. Thursday turned out to the worst possible day for the Biden campaign to make the candidates' schedules an issue. Why?\n\nBoth Trump and Joe Biden happened to be in New York City on Thursday, but for very different reasons. Trump attended the funeral of a New York City police officer who was shot by a career criminal during a traffic stop on Monday.\n\n\"President Trump is moved by the invitation to join NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller's family and colleagues as they deal with his senseless and tragic death,\" Karoline Leavitt, Trump's campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nAs for Joe Biden, he's holding a campaign fundraiser at Radio City Music Hall with Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and a slate of left-wing celebrities.\n\nThe stars are coming out for President Joe Biden's campaign fundraiser Thursday with former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\n\nStephen Colbert, host of CBS' \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" will moderate an \"armchair conversation\" with Biden, Obama and Clinton at the high-dollar event at Radio City Music Hall in New York, according to the campaign.\n\nActress Mindy Kaling, who starred in the television shows \"The Office\" and \"The Mindy Project,\" is set to host the program. The evening will feature musical guests Lizzo, Queen Latifah, Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo, and Lea Michele.\n\nThe fundraiser is expected to be the most lucrative to date for Biden's reelection campaign, which has significantly outraised former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy is Lizzo's inclusion in the fundraiser, seeing as she is currently facing accusations of sexual harassment and religious and racial discrimination from former backup dancers.\n\n\"It's shameful that Lizzo would be chosen to headline an event like this amid such egregious allegations,\" Ron Zambrano, an attorney for the backup dancers, told NewsNation. \"Without getting into the politics, I can't imagine why anyone would want Lizzo representing them in any way given her reprehensible behavior. It's just a terrible look.\"\n\nJoe Biden has also been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women.\n\nSo, this was terrible timing for the Biden campaign to make an issue of the two candidates' schedules, because Donald Trump clearly had the more noble agenda today.",

        "body": "President Biden will have an entourage of support from celebrities and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at a historic campaign fundraiser set to raise more than $25 million Thursday night, as Biden continues to aggressively campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe event at Radio City Music Hall in New York is meant to reinforce Biden's campaign finances and widen his voter outreach.\n\nBiden already has a commanding lead over Trump in campaign finances, especially as Trump and his groups are figuring out how to cover Trump's legal costs. But Biden and Democrats aren't holding back to increase that gap: By mid March, Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee amassed a combined $155 million cash on hand, while the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee ended February with $44.85 million cash on hand. Since Super Tuesday, the Biden campaign has outspent the Trump team on pre-booked advertising by nearly four times.\n\n\"This historic raise is a show of strong enthusiasm for President Biden and Vice President Harris and a testament to the unprecedented fundraising machine we've built,\" said Biden-Harris 2024 campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nObama and Clinton uniting forces behind Biden could help the incumbent weather the unique political challenges that his predecessors -- who both had higher approval ratings than Biden during their reelection campaigns -- did not have to face: the aftermath of a worldwide pandemic, the Jan. 6 insurrection, turmoil over abortion access, and a growing protest vote campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nA star-studded cast will also appear with the former presidents and Biden, including Mindy Kaling, Ben Platt and Stephen Colbert hosting the event.\n\nIt's an opportunity for Biden to counter concerns about his age and polls that show a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nThe Trump campaign notes that Biden hasn't had to spend money fending off primary challengers, like Trump has. The Trump campaign also is just now getting access to the Republican National Committee support since officially securing the nomination.\n\n\"Our digital online fundraising continues to skyrocket, our major donor investments are climbing, and Democrats are running scared of the fundraising prowess of President Trump,\" said Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung.\n\nAnother challenge for Trump, though, are his mounting legal fees, which his political action committee is spending money on.\n\nKatzenberg took a swipe at that fact, and said Biden is focused on demonstrating his track record to voters.\n\n\"Unlike our opponent, every dollar we're raising is going to reach the voters who will decide this election -- communicating the President's historic record, his vision for the future and laying plain the stakes of this election.\"\n\nThe money race isn't anywhere near over. Trump and the Republican Party have a fundraiser next week that they say will overshadow Biden's event by raising at least $33 million.",

        "title": "Joe Biden Spikes Immigrant Population to 51.4 Million",
        "body": "The number of migrants in the United States is at a record 51.4 million, up by 6.4 million people since President Joe Biden took office, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe data shows one in six people, or 15.5 percent of the U.S. population, arrived via the federal government's myriad official and unofficial migration paths.\n\nAlmost one in five workers was born outside the United States, according to the March 28 report.\n\nCIS reported:\n\nSince President Biden took office in January 2021, the foreign-born population has grown by 6.4 million -- larger than the individual populations of 33 states.\n\n...\n\nIf current trends continue, the foreign-born population will reach nearly 60 million and 17.5 percent [one in six] of the U.S. population by the end of a second Biden term -- both figures would be without any precedent in American history.\n\nThe U.S. population consists of 280 million native-born Americans and 51 million immigrants.\n\nOne century ago, voters forced Congress to sharply reduce immigration in 1924. The shutdown lasted 41 years until 1965. The low level of migration helped to spread the wealth created by the industrial economy, so ensuring a wealthy and powerful middle class.\n\nBut in 1965, lobbyists persuaded the federal government to reopen the doors and adopt the Cold War's \"Nation of Immigrants\" narrative. The government doubled the inflow in 1990 under Republican President George H.W. Bush and then re-doubled the inflow in 2021 under President Joe Biden. The result is a bigger national economy -- and smaller per-person income.\n\nMost migrants arrive via the government's many legal migration routes, according to CIS. \"Legal immigrants still account for roughly three-fourths of the total foreign-born population,\" the report said.'\n\nCIS estimated that Biden has increased the population of illegal immigrants by roughly four million, hitting \"14 million in February 2024 [which is] four million larger than in January 2021, when President Biden took office.\"\n\nThe population of illegal migrants grows as the government fails to stop them coming over the border. But it also shrinks as some illegals go home, die, or win legal status.\n\nBiden's nation-changing inflow is enabled by the Democratic Party's powerful combination of big government politicians and activists, the party's Wall Street donors, and the investors' astroturf empire of open-border ideological progressives,\n\nThe Democrats' pro-migration political coalition is strongest in major cities.\n\nMany cities rely on a flood of new migrants to replace the millions of Americans who quit the high-crime, high-rent cities for middle-class suburbs, and greener states. On March 18, for example, New York politicians called for taxpayers to fund the immigration lawyers who will bring in their replacements:\n\nImmigration is a boon for New York City's economy - immigrants are more likely to work, start a business, and contribute billions of dollars into our New York economy in spending power and tax revenue,\" said Comptroller Brad Lander. \"Investing in immigration legal services will bolster New York City's bottom line by keeping workers in the workforce, getting new arrivals work authorization, keeping families together and providing pathways to upward mobility.\n\n\"An international migration Ponzi scheme is the only thing that averts a demographic doom loop for cities like New York and San Francisco,\" as Americans flee the Democrats' huge and badly-run cities, Lind wrote in a September 2023 article for Compact Magazine. He continued:\n\nThe rentier cities have come to depend on a constant influx of new immigrants from other countries to replace the immigrants and natives who move out in search of lower prices or higher wages. Low-wage immigrants are welcome as servants for the urban managerial elite, tenants for urban slumlords, clients for public agencies and nonprofits, riders for mass transit, and taxpayers for urban governments.\n\nThe immigration policy is very unpopular, but government officials insist they profit by extracting more government clients from poor countries.\n\n\"Its clear that even though we welcome refugees and asylees for humanitarian reasons, they bring cultural richness, enhance community vibrancy, and - as we showed in our report - add a net positive economic contribution to the U.S.!,\" claimed Miranda Lynch-Smith, a deputy assistant secretary for Human Services policy. \"There are so many reasons to do what is right and welcome and assist refugees and asylees,\" she said in February 2024.\n\nHowever, the main drivers of immigration are the nation's corps of bipartisan investors and CEOs who gain more wealth from the inflow of additional consumers, renters, and workers.\n\nExtraction Migration\n\nSince at least 1990, the federal government has relied on Extraction Migration to grow the economy after allowing investors to move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries.\n\nThe policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens in Canada and the United Kingdom.",

        "body": "SBF could potentially earn enough credit to reduce his sentence by half.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried (SBF), founder of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX, recently received a 25-year prison sentence for crypto fraud. This sentence is far less than the 40-year minimum prosecutors sought and the 110-year maximum suggested by sentencing guidelines. Legal experts said that SBF might serve even less time with good behavior.\n\nJames Murphy, a renowned crypto lawyer, outlined possible next steps in the SBF case. According to him, SBF's team will appeal the conviction and sentence as part of its legal strategy.\n\nMurphy's point came after SBF's legal team confirmed plans to file appeals against both the guilty verdict and the sentence on fraud and money laundering charges in today's court.\n\nMurphy also suggested that supporters of SBF, particularly those involved in Effective Altruism, might lobby the Biden administration for a pardon or commutation. Additionally, he added that SBF could be released early under federal \"good time credit\" policies.\n\nIn the federal prison system, inmates are typically required to serve 85% of their sentence before being eligible for release. This is known as \"good time credit,\" designed to incentivize good behavior and reduce recidivism.\n\nSharing Murphy's viewpoint, Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor, told CNN that SBF's good time credit could significantly reduce his actual time served.\n\n\"There is no possibility of parole in federal criminal cases, but Bankman-Fried can still shave time off his 25-year sentence with good behavior,\" stated Epner. \"SBF may serve as little as 12.5 years, if he gets all of the jailhouse credit available to him.\"\n\nStill, the appeal's success, any potential lobbying efforts, and SBF's actual prison time are all uncertain at this point.\n\nFTX's saga of lies and fraud has reached a turning point as Sam Bankman-Fried received a 25-year prison sentence in Manhattan federal court for crypto fraud on Thursday. Judge also ordered a forfeiture of $11.02 billion and recommended medium-security for SBF's federal prison term.\n\nSBF's inner circle, including Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh, and Ryan Salame were previously convicted for their roles in the FTX saga. Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, is expected to face sentence on May 1, as reported by Bloomberg.",

        "body": "BALTIMORE (AP) -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore warned Thursday of a \"very long road ahead\" to recover from the loss of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge as the Biden administration approved $60 million in immediate federal aid after the deadly collapse.\n\nMassive barges carrying cranes streamed toward the site to begin the challenging work of removing twisted metal and concrete as a first step toward reopening a key shipping route blocked by the wreckage of the span.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nMoore promised that \"the best minds in the world\" were working on plans to clear the debris, move the cargo ship that rammed into the bridge from the channel, recover the bodies of the four remaining workers presumed dead and investigate what went wrong.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Government is working hand in hand with industry to investigate the area, including the wreck, and remove the ship,\" said Moore, a Democrat, who said quick aid is needed to \"lay the foundation for a rapid recovery.\" President Joe Biden has pledged the federal government would pay the full cost of rebuilding the bridge.\n\n\"This work is not going to take hours. This work is not going to take days. This work is not going to take weeks,\" Moore said. \"We have a very long road ahead of us.\"\n\nU.S. Coast Guard officials said Wednesday night that barges were on their way to the spot where the bridge crossed the Patapsco River, but it was not clear when they would arrive.\n\nThe devastation at the site of the collapse, which happened when the powerless cargo ship struck a pillar supporting the bridge early Tuesday, is extensive. Divers recovered the bodies of two men in a pickup truck near the bridge's middle span Wednesday, but officials said they have to start clearing the wreckage before anyone could reach the bodies of four other missing workers.\n\nState police said the vehicles appeared to be encased in a \"superstructure\" of concrete and other debris.\n\nYou might be interested in\n\nBreaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star\n\nDec 31, 1969 Breaking News Headlines & Top Stories | The Star\n\nDec 31, 1969\n\n\"We have exhausted all search efforts in the areas around this wreckage, and based on sonar scans, we firmly believe that the vehicles are encased in the superstructure and concrete,\" Col. Roland L. Butler Jr., superintendent of Maryland State Police, said Wednesday.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board officials boarded the ship, the Dali, to recover information from its electronics and paperwork and to interview the captain and other crew members. Investigators shared a preliminary timeline of events before the crash, which federal and state officials have said appeared to be an accident.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The best minds in the world are coming together to collect the information that we need to move forward with speed and safety in our response to this collapse,\" Moore said Thursday.\n\nOf the 21 crew members on the ship, 20 are from India, Randhir Jaiswal, the nation's foreign ministry spokesperson, told reporters. One was slightly injured and needed stitches, but \"all are in good shape and good health,\" Jaiswal said.\n\nThe victims, who were part of a construction crew fixing potholes on the bridge, were from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, Butler said. At least eight people initially went into the water when the ship struck the bridge column, and two of them were rescued Tuesday, officials said.\n\nThe crash caused the bridge to break and fall into the water within seconds. Authorities had just enough time to stop vehicle traffic, but didn't get a chance to alert the construction crew.\n\nDuring the Baltimore Orioles' opening day game Thursday, Sgt. Paul Pastorek, Cpl. Jeremy Herbert and Officer Garry Kirts of the Maryland Transportation Authority were honored for their actions in halting bridge traffic and preventing further loss of life.\n\nThe three said in a statement that they were \"proud to carry out our duties as officers of this state to save the lives that we could.\"\n\nThe Dali, which is managed by Synergy Marine Group, was headed from Baltimore to Sri Lanka. It is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd., and Danish shipping giant Maersk said it had chartered it.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSynergy extended sympathies to the victims' families in a statement early Thursday.\n\n\"We deeply regret this incident and the problems it has caused for the people of Baltimore and the region's economy that relies on this vitally important port,\" Synergy said, noting that it would continue to cooperate with investigators.\n\nScott Cowan, president of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 333, said the union is scrambling to help its roughly 2,400 members whose jobs are at risk of drying up until shipping can resume in the Port of Baltimore.\n\n\"If there's no ships, there's no work,\" he said. \"We're doing everything we can.\"\n\nThe huge vessel was carrying nearly 4,700 metal shipping containers, 56 of them with hazardous materials inside. Thirteen of those were destroyed, officials said. However, industrial hygienists who evaluated the contents identified them as perfumes and soaps, according to the Key Bridge Joint Information Center.\n\n\"There was no immediate threat to the environment,\" the center said.\n\nBooms were placed to control the spread of any oil that seeped into the water, and state environmental officials were also sampling the water Thursday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCommercial divers sent to work beneath the bridge debris and container ship will be met with challenging conditions, including limited visibility and moving currents, one expert said.\n\n\"Debris can be dangerous, especially when you can't see what's right in front of you,\" said Donald Gibbons, an instructor with the Eastern Atlantic States Carpenters Technical Centers.\n\nThe sudden loss of a highway that carries 30,000 vehicles a day and the port disruption will affect not only thousands of dockworkers and commuters but also U.S. consumers, who are likely to feel the impact of shipping delays.\n\nThe governors of New York and New Jersey offered to take on cargo shipments that have been disrupted, to try to minimize supply chain disruptions.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who met Thursday with supply chain officials, has said the Biden administration was focused on reopening the port and rebuilding the bridge, but he did not put a timeline on those efforts.\n\nFrom 1960 to 2015, there were 35 major bridge collapses worldwide due to ship or barge collisions, according to the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWitte reported from Annapolis, Maryland.

        "title": "Republican States File Lawsuit Challenging Biden's Student Loan Repayment Plan - WCCB Charlotte's CW",
        "body": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A group of Republican-led states is suing the Biden administration to block a new student loan repayment plan that provides a faster path to cancellation and lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers.\n\nIn a federal lawsuit filed Thursday, 11 states led by Kansas argue that Biden overstepped his authority in creating the SAVE Plan, which was made available to borrowers last year and has already canceled loans for more than 150,000.\n\nIt argues that the new plan is no different from Biden's first attempt at student loan cancellation, which the Supreme Court rejected last year. \"Last time Defendants tried this the Supreme Court said that this action was illegal. Nothing since then has changed,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Education Department declined to comment on the lawsuit but noted that Congress in 1993 gave the department the authority to define the terms of income-driven repayment plans.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris Administration won't stop fighting to provide support and relief to borrowers across the country -- no matter how many times Republican elected officials try to stop us,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nBiden announced the SAVE repayment plan in 2022, alongside a separate plan to cancel up to $20,000 in debt for more than 40 million Americans. The Supreme Court blocked the cancellation plan after Republican states sued, but the court didn't examine SAVE, which was still being hashed out.\n\nThe new lawsuit was filed this same week the White House hosted a \"day of action\" to promote the SAVE Plan. The Biden administration says more than 7.7 million borrowers have enrolled in the plan, including more than 5 million who have had their monthly payments reduced to $100 or less because they have lower yearly incomes.\n\nThe challenge was filed electronically in federal court in Kansas by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who requested that any trial be in Wichita, the state's largest city. The lawsuit asks a judge to halt the plan immediately. Along with Kansas, the suit is backed by Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.\n\n\"In a completely brazen fashion, the president pressed ahead anyway,\" Kobach said during a news conference at the Kansas Statehouse. \"The law simply does not allow President Biden to do what he wants to do.\"\n\nBiden's new repayment plan is a modified version of other income-based repayment plans that the Education Department has offered since the '90s. The earliest versions were created by Congress to help struggling borrowers, capping payments at a portion of their income and canceling any remaining debt after 20 or 25 years.\n\nThe new plan offers more generous terms than ever, offering to reduce monthly payments for more borrowers and canceling loans in as little as 10 years. Unlike other plans, it prevents interest from snowballing as long as borrowers make their monthly payments.\n\nThe plan's provisions are being phased in this year, and the quicker path to cancellation was originally scheduled to take effect later this summer. But the Biden administration accelerated that benefit and started canceling loans for some borrowers in February.\n\nBiden said it was meant \"to give more borrowers breathing room so they can get out from under the burden of student loan debt.\"\n\nInstead of creating a new plan from scratch, the Education Department amended existing plans through federal regulation. Supporters saw it as a legal maneuver that put the plan on firmer grounding, anticipating a challenge from Republicans.\n\nBut in the new lawsuit, Kobach argues that Biden needed to go through Congress to make such significant changes.\n\nThe states argue that Biden's plan will harm them in many ways.\n\nWith such a generous repayment plan, fewer borrowers will have an incentive to go into public service and pursue the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, the states argue. They predict more state employees will leave their jobs, and it will worsen public schools' struggles to recruit and retain teachers.\n\nThey argue the plan will inject hundreds of billions of dollars in loan relief into the U.S. economy, which would require states to increase fraud protection efforts. The plan \"will create enormous opportunities for fraudsters to exploit student debt borrowers that would not otherwise exist,\" according to the suit.\n\nIf successful, it would effectively kill the last remnant of Biden's first attempt at widespread student loan relief. After the Supreme Court blocked his wider plan last year, Biden ordered the Education Department to craft a new plan using a different legal justification. The agency is now pursuing a more limited plan for mass cancellation.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin",

        "title": "With 3rd Democratic senator opposed, Biden judicial nominee in jeopardy",
        "body": "President Biden's pick to be the first Muslim American appeals court judge appears to be in jeopardy after a third Democratic senator came out against him Wednesday, part of a groundswell of opposition over the nominee's ties to an organization that represents Muslim, Arab and South Asian law students and a group that advocates for incarcerated people and their families.\n\nSen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., told the Nevada Independent that she would not support Adeel A. Mangi's nomination to the Philadelphia-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, citing \"concerns I've heard from law enforcement in Nevada.\"\n\nRosen is the third Democratic senator -- and second senator from Nevada -- to come out against Mangi, a Harvard- and Oxford-trained lawyer in private practice who has been accused by Republican senators of being antisemitic and anti-police.\n\nSens. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., have also said they would not vote for him. Cortez Masto expressed concerns about Mangi's membership on the advisory board of the criminal justice reform group Alliance of Families for Justice. Manchin told Politico he will not vote for any judicial nominee who does not have at least some bipartisan support.\n\nThe White House said Thursday that it is still trying to marshal support for Mangi and convince lawmakers that the attacks against him are baseless.\n\n\"Some Senate Republicans and their extreme allies are relentlessly smearing Adeel Mangi with baseless accusations that he is anti-police,\" White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients said in a statement. \"That could not be further from the truth, and the close to a dozen law enforcement organizations that have endorsed him agree.\"\n\nThe White House earlier this month called the attacks against Mangi a \"cruel, Islamophobic, smear campaign.\"\n\nRepublicans and conservative groups such as the Judicial Crisis Network have accused Mangi of sharing antisemitic views espoused by panelists who spoke at events hosted by Rutgers Law School's Center for Security, Race and Rights. Mangi, an experienced litigator and a partner at a New York law firm, previously served as a member of the center's advisory board.\n\nIn 2021, on the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2021, attacks, the center hosted a roundtable discussion that featured several controversial speakers. Republicans criticized that event and a more recent lecture on life under \"violent occupation and settler colonial violence in Palestine,\" which the center hosted just days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 Israelis and included the kidnapping of about 250 hostages. During Mangi's Dec. 13 nomination hearing, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned him about the Hamas attack and whether he believed they were justified.\n\n\"The events of October 7 were horrific. A horror,\" Mangi said, noting that his time on the center's advisory board did not mean he shares the views of all who work or speak there. \"The attacks on civilians were abominable and against everything that I stand for.\"\n\nMangi has separately drawn criticism from more than a dozen law enforcement organizations, such as the Police Conference of New York, according to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. But other groups, including the International Law Enforcement Officers Association and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, are supporting him, as are the AFL-CIO, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee and a coalition of more than a dozen Jewish organizations.\n\n\"Mr. Mangi has displayed the qualities of leadership, empathy, excellence, and persistence in supporting and defending the U.S. Constitution while ensuring equal protection and justice for all Americans,\" NOBLE wrote in an endorsement letter reviewed by The Post.\n\nPriya Purandare, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, also expressed support for Mangi in a statement. \"The baseless attacks against Mr. Mangi have a chilling effect,\" she said. \"If left unanswered, the nation runs the risk of losing a generation of talent who shares Mr. Mangi's faith from entering public service and the opportunity to compose a federal bench that reflects the changing demographics of the United States. History will remember this moment.\"\n\nWith Cortez Masto, Manchin and Rosen opposed to his confirmation, Mangi would need the support of moderate Republicans such as Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to be confirmed. The Judicial Crisis Network has launched anti-Mangi ads in Montana, Pennsylvania and D.C., targeting Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Bob Casey, D-Pa.\n\nIf Biden pulls Mangi's nomination or he withdraws, it would be a rare defeat for a president who has made diversifying the nation's federal judiciary a key priority. Biden nominated Zahid N. Quraishi as the first Muslim federal district court judge early in his term.\n\nMangi would be Biden's third judicial nominee to withdraw. Michael Delaney gave up his nomination to the Boston-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit in May following Democratic concerns about his past work defending a New Hampshire boarding school in a lawsuit over sexual assault.\n\nLess than a week later, Jabari Wamble dropped his bid to become a U.S. district judge in Kansas. The White House didn't provide an explanation for the withdrawal, but The Associated Press, citing an official familiar with the confirmation process who spoke on the condition of anonymity, reported that Wamble was expecting to receive a \"not qualified\" rating from the American Bar Association, which grades judicial candidates.\n\nThe firestorm surrounding Mangi's nomination comes at a time of heightened political sensitivity surrounding the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and Israel's prolonged military response. Threats against Arab, Jewish and Muslim Americans are on the rise, according to federal officials, and college campuses have been embroiled in angry debates over Zionism, Palestinian rights, antisemitism and free speech.\n\nBut Mangi's supporters, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., still stand behind him.\n\n\"When we look at Mr. Mangi's record -- his professional life, his commitment to religious freedom and civil rights, his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee -- it only reinforces his commitment to upholding and advancing the fundamental values we all hold as Americans,\" Booker said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"I'm proud to champion his nomination and I know the White House, Senate Democratic leaders, and I stand behind Adeel Mangi 100 percent.\"",

        "title": "King County gets $500M loan from EPA to update wastewater treatment in era of climate change",
        "body": "Climate Lab is a Seattle Times initiative that explores the effects of climate change in the Pacific Northwest and beyond. The project is funded in part by The Bullitt Foundation, Mike and Becky Hughes, University of Washington and Walker Family Foundation, and its fiscal sponsor is the Seattle Foundation.\n\nDISCOVERY PARK -- Solar panels sit atop the newest building at King County's West Point Treatment Plant. Inside, you won't find pipes funneling the region's sewage and stormwater; instead stand rows of newly installed high-voltage batteries intended to keep the pumps pumping during storms -- and contaminated water out of Puget Sound.\n\nThese batteries are part of ongoing efforts to improve wastewater treatment here and prepare for storms, which are likely to become more frequent or more intense with human-induced climate change. The county plans to invest $10 billion in these projects over the next decade.\n\nThe plans got a huge boost Thursday when King County and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced the first installment of a nearly $500 million loan package from the agency that will finance 14 wastewater infrastructure projects across the county. It's the largest financial commitment to the county's wastewater system from the EPA, and the initial installment is expected to save sewer utility ratepayers $19.8 million.\n\nThe facility, perched on a peninsula on Puget Sound in North Seattle, treats millions of gallons of wastewater each day. The loans will help replace raw sewage pumps and corroded pipes and will provide seismic upgrades for the administration building.\n\n\"When you're standing at this facility and you're looking at the water, it is really crystal clear what it is you're working to protect,\" said Casey Sixkiller, regional administrator of the EPA, at a news conference Thursday at West Point.\n\nWastewater and stormwater are pumped into the treatment plant where screens remove large trash, sand, gravel and twigs. Cooking oils, grease, soaps and hair are removed from the wastewater before raw sewage and stormwater move to tanks where sludge bugs -- sewage-eating microbes -- reduce the volume of solids produced in the treatment process and kill harmful pathogens and bacteria. Then the water is disinfected and sent thousands of feet offshore into Puget Sound.\n\nWest Point, one of the largest wastewater treatment plants on the West Coast, receives sewage and stormwater flows from Seattle, Shoreline, north Lake Washington, North King County and parts of South Snohomish County.\n\n\"This one really handles some unique challenges because the combined system of flows into this plant can go from 90 million gallons per day level up to over 400 million gallons,\" said Kamuron Gurol, director of the King County Wastewater Treatment Division. \"You get a rainstorm ... and that plant has to be able to accommodate and successfully treat flows that can literally quadruple in size and in an hour. The type of equipment that's necessary to handle that kind of flow variation needs to be as robust as we can.\"\n\nThe regional wastewater system was created by community leaders who envisioned a way to address water pollution in Lake Washington, Puget Sound and the Duwamish River, and to serve a growing population, said Christie True, recently retired director of the county Department of Natural Resources and Parks.\n\nIn the 1950s, wastewater flowed into Lake Washington, Puget Sound and many rivers and smaller lakes, without enough treatment; beaches were fouled with waste and black bacterial slime.\n\nThe West Point Treatment Plant and South Treatment Plant in Renton came online in the 1960s, and the results were dramatic, True said. But the system wasn't built all at once.\n\nWhen construction began, about 30 billion gallons of combined sewage and stormwater would overflow into the Sound every year, True said. Today it's closer to 1 billion gallons.\n\nMore recent discharges have shown the vulnerability of the system in extreme weather.\n\nSeveral system failures at West Point during heavy rainfall in 2017 caused significant flooding at the facility and resulted in an estimated 244 million gallons of untreated or partially treated sewage discharging into Puget Sound. Nearly 8 billion gallons of wastewater received limited primary treatment and disinfection over the next 77 days.\n\nIn 2019, True said, a three-quarters-of-a-second power interruption brought the equipment to a halt and caused a discharge of untreated sewage and stormwater into Puget Sound.\n\nA 2019 audit found the risks at the plant would not be fully mitigated for years, and today, there's still work to be done.\n\nThe past five years have been the most productive for these improvements since the regional treatment system was built in the 1960s, according to the county. The Wastewater Treatment Division has already begun making seismic upgrades, replacing aging pumps and pipes, and building the 24,000-square-foot structure full of batteries at West Point that will provide operators with a more reliable power supply.\n\nIn 2021, King County closed on a $96.8 million loan to help design and construct the Ship Canal Water Quality Project, a tunnel that will store up to 30 million gallons of untreated sewage and polluted stormwater.\n\nIt's part of a $615 million-plus effort by Seattle and King County to keep untreated liquid from spilling into the Lake Washington Ship Canal, Lake Union and Salmon Bay when the antiquated drainage system in nearby neighborhoods is overwhelmed by heavy rains.\n\nKing County was the first to receive a loan from the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, for the Georgetown Wet Weather Treatment Station, and the loan package announced Thursday marks the third round of awards the county has been selected in.\n\nThe $498.3 million loan package from the EPA is expected to help the county complete seismic upgrades at two regional wastewater treatment plants, improvements to the recycled water system and upgrades to miles of conveyance and sewer pipes.\n\nThe first installment, a $194 million loan package funded by the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, is expected to save King County ratepayers millions and lower the county's annual debt payments through an extended repayment period.\n\nThe projects include:\n\nThe loans will also help the county comply with a settlement agreement with the Suquamish Tribe that outlined an estimated $600 million in improvements to be made at the treatment plant over the next decade.\n\nIn 2020, the tribe filed an intent to sue the county, documenting nearly a dozen times in 2018 and 2019 when untreated or improperly treated sewage overflowed into the Sound from the West Point plant.\n\nWithout these investments, Suquamish Chairman Leonard Forsman said, the degrading water quality impacts shellfish, fish and the people who rely on them for subsistence and commercial harvest.\n\n\"It's a constant battle, in addition to climate change, we just try to push back as hard as we can to preserve what we've been gifted by the Creator and have a responsibility to preserve it for the next generations,\" Forsman said.\n\nBut these projects won't address new and emerging contaminant issues like nutrient pollution or PFAS.\n\nThe county is currently drawing up plans for a project to control overflows from five combined sewer outfalls where the Duwamish River meets Elliott Bay.\n\n\"Thanks to bold action by President Biden and by the EPA, we will achieve even more for people, for salmon, for the orca, and for all living things that call this remarkable corner of the continent home,\" King County Executive Dow Constantine said.",

        "body": "The federal three-judge panel acknowledged the \"unusual\" nature of its decision to reinstate a map that it found to have moved 30,000 Black residents out of a congressional district based on their race in violation of their constitutional rights. Freighter pilot called for tugboat help before plowing into Baltimore bridge The pilot of the cargo freighter that knocked down a highway bridge into Baltimore Harbor had radioed for tugboat help and reported a power loss minutes earlier, federal safety officials said on Wednesday, citing audio from the ship's \"black box\" data recorder.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current US domestic news briefs.\n\nA million solar eclipse enthusiasts expected at Niagara Falls\n\nFrom vintage train rides costing almost $4,000 per person to hotel rooms listed at $1,600 a night, businesses in and around majestic Niagara Falls are preparing to cash in on the April 8 total solar eclipse - with around a million visitors expected. The dramatic waterfall, situated along the Canadian-U.S. border, is in the path of the eclipse, and many people are splurging on hotels and rentals in advance to experience the phenomenon at one of North America's natural wonders. Demand has pushed up prices of hotels as people making last-minute plans book the last of the available accommodations.\n\nWhite House issues new federal standards to collect data on race\n\nThe White House on Thursday announced new standards for collecting federal data on race and ethnicity, a decision that will touch organizations that receive federal funding, determine how congressional districts are drawn and whether equal employment policies can be enforced. The standards from the White House's Office of Management & Budget (OMB)- revised for the first time since 1997- requires federal agencies to use one combined question for race and ethnicity, encourages respondents to select multiple options on how they identify and adds Middle Eastern or North African as a new identification category.\n\nUS gives Maryland $60 million to rebuild collapsed Baltimore bridge\n\nThe U.S. government awarded the state of Maryland $60 million in federal emergency relief on Thursday in response to the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, an extraordinarily fast disbursement after such a disaster. The bridge came tumbling down early on Tuesday after a massive cargo freighter that had lost power plowed into the structure in Baltimore Harbor. Two bodies have been recovered and four other missing people are presumed dead.\n\nTexas judge transfers lawsuit over card fees to Washington, D.C\n\nA federal judge in a Texas court that has become a favorite for conservative challenges to Biden administration policies transferred a lawsuit challenging a rule curbing credit card late fees to a court in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman said half of the business groups that sued are based in Washington, as are most of the lawyers representing them and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which wrote the rule the groups are seeking to block.\n\nBiden's campaign war chest exceeds Trump's before major fundraising event\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's campaign has pulled in more money ahead of November's election than that of his Republican rival Donald Trump, which analysts attribute to Biden's incumbent status and support from Democratic predecessors. That support will be on full display Thursday at a fundraising event for Biden in New York City, where former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, both prominent Democrats, will be in attendance.\n\nSouth Carolina voting map faulted for racial bias by court revived for 2024\n\nA federal court that previously threw out a Republican-drawn South Carolina electoral map for bias against Black voters decided on Thursday that it can be used in this year's congressional elections, a ruling that could undercut Democratic chances of winning control of the U.S. House of Representatives. The federal three-judge panel acknowledged the \"unusual\" nature of its decision to reinstate a map that it found to have moved 30,000 Black residents out of a congressional district based on their race in violation of their constitutional rights.\n\nFreighter pilot called for tugboat help before plowing into Baltimore bridge\n\nThe pilot of the cargo freighter that knocked down a highway bridge into Baltimore Harbor had radioed for tugboat help and reported a power loss minutes earlier, federal safety officials said on Wednesday, citing audio from the ship's \"black box\" data recorder. The head of the National Transportation Safety Board also said that Francis Scott Key Bridge, a traffic artery over the harbor built in 1976, lacked structural engineering redundancies common to newer spans, making it more vulnerable to a catastrophic collapse.\n\nImmigrants killed in Baltimore bridge collapse died doing job 'others do not want to do'\n\nThey came to the United States for a chance at a better life. They found work filling pot holes on a bridge in the middle of the night, and they ended up dead in the Baltimore harbor. The six victims of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse were all immigrants from Mexico and Central America, doing the kind of grueling work that many immigrants take on, when a container ship crashed into a support pillar at 1:30 a.m. EST on Tuesday and sent them plunging into the icy Patapsco River.\n\nUS House to deliver Homeland Secretary Mayorkas impeachment to Senate April 10\n\nThe Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will deliver two articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate on April 10, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Thursday. Mayorkas, who Republicans blame for record flows of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border, was narrowly impeached by the House last month on allegations that he has not enforced U.S. immigration laws and has made false statements to Congress.\n\nTrump can't match Biden's 2024 fundraising, Republican's campaign says\n\nDonald Trump will be unable to match President Joe Biden's fundraising totals in this year's presidential election race, the Republican candidate's campaign said on Thursday. \"We're never gonna be able to raise dollar for dollar with Biden,\" a Trump campaign adviser said in a call with reporters.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "body": "(Reuters) - A federal judge in a Texas court that has become a favorite for conservative challenges to Biden administration policies transferred a lawsuit challenging a rule curbing credit card late fees to a court in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Pittman said half of the business groups that sued are based in Washington, as are most of the lawyers representing them and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which wrote the rule the groups are seeking to block.\n\nThe CFPB had asked the judge to transfer the case, as no card issuer subject to the rule is based in Fort Worth.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which sued with five other groups, countered that potentially affected cardholders reside there.\n\nPittman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, rejected that argument on Thursday, saying it would allow the lawsuit to be filed anywhere in the country, instead of where the underlying events occurred.\n\n\"Venue is not a continental breakfast; you cannot pick and choose on a plaintiffs' whim where and how a lawsuit is filed,\" Pittman said.\n\nSpokespeople for the CFPB and Chamber of Commerce did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe groups had urged Pittman to block the rule, which is set to take effect in May, while the lawsuit plays out, arguing that in order to make changes that may be necessary, they will need to send out notices to consumers starting on Friday. They have asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review Pittman's decision not to expedite the case.\n\nThe rule deals with what the CFPB has called \"excessive\" fees credit card issuers charge for late payments, something the consumer protection agency estimated costs consumers $12 billion a year.\n\nUnder that rule, credit card issuers with more than 1 million open accounts can only charge $8 for late fees, unless they can prove higher fees are necessary to cover their costs. The previous rule allowed issuers to charge up to $30 or $41 for subsequent late payments.\n\nPittman, one of two active federal judges in Fort Worth, had raised concerns about whether the lawsuit belonged in his court after the federal court administrators announced a new policy aimed at curbing \"judge shopping.\"\n\nThe Fort Worth courthouse has become a popular destination for conservative litigants and business groups challenging the policies of President Joe Biden's administration, including on student debt, guns and LGBTQ rights.\n\nPittman said Thursday several factors supported transferring the credit card case, including that his court is busier than the one in Washington, and that taxpayers would pay for CFPB lawyers to travel to Texas.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

        "body": "(Reuters) - Donald Trump will be unable to match President Joe Biden's fundraising totals in this year's presidential election race, the Republican candidate's campaign said on Thursday.\n\n\"We're never gonna be able to raise dollar for dollar with Biden,\" a Trump campaign adviser said in a call with reporters.\n\nThe adviser blamed the fundraising disparity on \"billionaire\" supporters of the Democratic president, and appeared keen to paint a picture of a Trump campaign fueled by grassroots, working-class supporters.\n\nA second campaign adviser said Trump's campaign is \"fueled by hundreds of thousands of grassroots contributors across the country, and I'd much rather have that because each one of those votes.\"\n\nAsked for a response, Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said: \"Trump's campaign is strapped for cash.\"\n\nDemocratic candidates have raised more money in support of their White House bids than their Republican counterparts in all election cycles after 2004. Money, however is not always an indication of success; Trump beat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 even though she raised far more cash than he did.\n\nBiden has been routinely outraising former President Trump, whose campaign, together with a joint fundraising committee, pulled in $20.3 million in February compared with the more than $53 million raised by Biden's reelection effort that month.\n\nLarge contributions make up about 55% of the $128.7 million that Biden's campaign committee has raised so far in the election cycle, OpenSecrets data showed, compared with 45% from small contributions.\n\nFor Trump, large contributions comprise 64% of the $96.1 million his campaign committee has raised, versus 36% from small contributions.\n\nThe two face a Nov. 5 general election rematch, in a race that opinion polls suggest will be extremely close.\n\nBiden was holding a star-studded fundraiser in New York on Thursday night with his Democratic predecessors Barack Obama and Bill Clinton that his campaign said has already raised $25 million.\n\nThe Trump campaign is due to hold a fundraiser on April 6 hosted by billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson in south Florida that aims to bring in $33 million, according to a person familiar with the event.\n\nThe Trump advisers on Thursday said that together with the Republican National Committee, the campaign will be opening dozens of offices and hiring hundreds of staff in the next few weeks, as they ramp up their general election infrastructure now that Trump has become the Republican Party's presidential candidate.\n\nTrump cemented his grip over the RNC in March when a loyalist, his daughter-in-law, and a senior campaign adviser were installed as chair, co-chair and chief of staff of the organization following his endorsement. An aggressive overhaul ensued, with dozens of employees losing their jobs.\n\nAs part of the leadership restructuring, a new slate of deputies will focus on battleground states as well as relationships with state parties and grassroots organizations, the second Trump campaign adviser said. Gone are regional directors who oversaw broad areas of the country.\n\n\"Folks that are focused on the battleground states will have a very narrow focus,\" the adviser said. \"We will not have that sort of middle layer that has historically existed to oversee a large region.\"\n\n(Reporting by Tim Reid and Nathan Layne; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Leslie Adler)",
