Colorado voters have zealously guarded that refund mechanism, rejecting measures that would redirect significant amounts to state programs, while approving some with limited spending figures.\n\nDemocrats with spending plans face a quandary this 2024-25 budget year, which is tight.\n\nConsider this: The \"set-aside\" -- general fund dollars that pay for bills still working their way through the process -- is only about $22 million, according to the budget narrative. About $3 million is already committed to sunset bills that reauthorize state programs.\n\nHowever, the lawmakers' wish list for general fund dollars is about $500 million. That means lawmakers will have to find a way to cut the costs of their spending priorities or see them go by the wayside.\n\nSo, lawmakers are turning to tax credits, particularly tax credits that tap the state's TABOR surplus.\n\nTo Democrats who are pushing for what amounts to spending reallocation from taxpayers to specific programs, the change is needed because the state doesn't invest enough in crucial areas, and it's more effective to focus a bigger amount on a specific need, rather than disperse money in smaller quantities among the population.\n\nCritics, meanwhile, countered that doing so takes away money from Coloradans, particularly those who need them the most, in order to fund \"special interest groups\" preferred by lawmakers.\n\nAt its core, the argument touches on the classic debate over whether it's best for government to spend people's money on specific priorities, under the assumption that it would produce the most benefit, or whether taxpayers should be able to keep -- in this case get back -- their dollars and spend it on their priorities.\n\nRep. Steven Woodrow, D-Denver, insisted he doesn't see the tax credit bills as spending down the TABOR surplus.\n\n\"We chronically underinvest in this state\" in areas such as infrastructure, education, and affordable housing,\" he told Colorado Politics recently. \"TABOR requires us to find mechanisms that incentivize the conduct we're trying to promote. When we look at how we can accomplish the things we need to, tax credits are what we have to work with.\"\n\nWoodrow said the question for lawmakers is whether those dollars should be returned to people in a \"less-than-equitable\" way or whether lawmakers can advance policy goals and investments.\n\nThat effort to tap TABOR began in earnest on April 8, with a committee passing the biggest of the 43 tax credit bills that remained alive.\n\nAnd some in the lawmakers' wish list would spend big dollars. Two measures -- one dealing with family tax credits and another for caregivers -- could take more than $900 million out of the TABOR surplus for 2024-25, estimated at $2 billion.\n\nIndeed, the wish lists for tax credit bills total $1.5 billion in 2024-25 and that amount will increase further in the years to come.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are betting that taxpayers would be okay with giving up their TABOR refunds well into the future, should the majority of those measures pass, in order -- they say -- to provide funding for low-income families, seniors, health care and childcare workers, housing, the homeless and many others.\n\nTable of Tax Credits, 2024-25\n\nSponsors: tax credit could slash child poverty rate in half\n\nThe House Finance Committee recently greenlighted House Bill 1311, the Family Affordability Tax Credit, sponsored by Reps. Chris deGruy Kennedy of Lakewood and Jenny Willford of Northglenn.\n\nIt would tap $655 million from the TABOR surplus in 2024-25. In following years, the tax credits will tap $695 million, specifically targeting the six-tiered sales tax refund that goes out to taxpayers when they file their taxes every year.\n\nThe legislative declaration for HB 1311, as amended, said Colorado is projected to have $2 billion in revenue over the TABOR limit and will continue to have similar amounts available in the future.\n\n\"At a time when these resources are available, it is imperative that the state distribute them in order to make the greatest impact on families and the economy,\" the bill said.\n\nDespite having one of the fastest growing economies in the United States, Colorado is unaffordable for working families and more than 133,000 children are living in poverty, said deGruy Kennedy during the hearing on HB 1311.\n\nFamilies need six-figure incomes to afford a median-priced home. Even for the cheapest one-bedroom apartment, at $1,364 per month, a worker would need to work 77 hours per week, he said.\n\nPoverty in early childhood, deGruy Kennedy said, results in an increased risk of toxic stress that can disrupt brain development and increase the long-term cognitive risks over the course of a child's life. Eventually, that affects educational attainment, earnings, adult health, reliance on public benefits, and even arrest rates, he said.\n\nWillford told the committee that the tax credit would put money into the hands of families with children under the age of 16: Up to $4,400 per child would be available for families with children aged five and younger, while families with children up to the age of 16 could receive up to $2,400 per child combined with existing tax credits, including earned income and child care tax credits.\n\n\"This initiative could slash our child poverty rate in half, making Colorado a beacon of hope and progress in the fight against childhood poverty,\" Willford said.\n\nShe added that it's not just about alleviating immediate financial burdens. The funds would \"smooth\" the transition for families moving off of public benefits and incentivize workers to pursue higher-paying jobs, which helps address the state's workforce shortage.\n\nDeGruy Kennedy said the bill's structure addresses child poverty and helps families that aren't below the poverty line -- those that earn up to $95,000 in income for joint filers.\n\nAn individual with income below $25,000 would receive $3,200 per child for children under six years of age and about 75% of that amount for children between six years and under 17.\n\nKennedy acknowledged that, with the spending measures approved by lawmakers over the years, the TABOR surplus won't last forever.\n\nHe noted the patchwork of spending lawmakers have adopted in recent years, such as providing money for school supplies, diapers and car seats.\n\nDeGruy Kennedy said the fundamental problem is when a family lives below the poverty line. \"No piecemeal support\" solves the problems, he said, adding the tax credits would help families with housing and other expenses. He called the proposed spending a game changer.\n\nHB 1311 does not have a sunset or repeal date, although as amended, it would depend on the state's September revenue forecast and whether the surplus is sufficient to pay for it. In years when it's not, that could mean a reduced benefit or possibly no benefit at all. DeGruy Kennedy said he is open to a sunset or repeal date.\n\nCritic: 'Gob-stopping' price tag Featured Local Savings\n\nRep. Lisa Frizell, R-Castle Rock, while calling the program's price tag \"gob-stopping,\" argued that HB 1311 doesn't help seniors who live below the poverty line and rely on the \"meager\" tax exemption they get for the senior property tax program. And that property tax program is only for seniors who own their own homes, not for renters.\n\n(Another proposal, House Bill 1052, would create a housing tax credit for seniors who rent, taking $37.4 million from the TABOR surplus. The credit is not available to seniors who claim the homestead exemption but to seniors with an income below $70,000 per year, whether they rent or own a home.)\n\nThe next most significant tax credit bill is House Bill 1312, which would provide around $256 million per year in tax credits, also tapping the TABOR surplus, for someone working in the \"care workforce.\"\n\nUnder the bill, the tax credit would apply to a \"child care worker, home health-care worker, personal care aide, certified nursing assistant, or other qualifying personal care worker including a family member, friend, and neighbor who provides care.\"\n\nUnlike HB 1311, the care worker bill sunsets in 2034 and requires the state auditor to measure the bill's effectiveness.\n\nRep. Mary Young, D-Greeley -- one of the sponsors of the bill that would divert $65.8 million in TABOR surplus dollars to reduce property tax-assessed values on the homes of seniors who had previously qualified for the homestead exemption but have since moved -- said her measure continues the tradition of using those surplus dollars to fund this extension for seniors, who have relied on it for years.\n\nAll three likely meet the definition of \"people-centered tax policies,\" according to the Colorado Fiscal Institute.\n\nEsther Turcios, a deputy director with the Colorado Fiscal Institute who views taxation a \"tool of oppression,\" said that lawmakers can't change the TABOR revenue cap, even for \"worthy\" programs, such as increasing teacher pay.\n\n\"We know that all folks are taxpayers, from the lowest to the highest incomes. The money going back is going to the same people who pay it, but should be done in more targeted ways,\" she said.\n\nShe also argued that workers' wages \"have not kept up with the cost of living.\"\n\n\"If the TABOR surplus can be returned through targeted tax credits, that's the most people-centered way to do it,\" she said, adding people should start thinking about them as a \"collective pot of funds that help.\"\n\nShe said the market hasn't fixed the wage problem, so depending on it to raise wages to livable levels isn't working. Trickle-down economics, which involves giving tax breaks to the wealthiest few, hasn't worked, either, she claimed.\n\nAs to whether it \"wealth redistribution,\" a criticism raised by opponents of using the TABOR surplus, Turcios said it's misleading because it gives the impression that those who would receive those dollars are not paying taxes themselves. They pay sales taxes, a regressive tax, in which people at the lowest income level pay a higher percentage of their income than those at the highest income level.\n\n'How is that fair?'\n\nDuring the past two years, taxpayers have received equalized TABOR refunds.\n\nIn 2022, the refund was $750 per individual or $1,500 for joint filers, and this year, it is $800 per individual and $1,600 per joint filer. The first refund was a check issued just before the general election, which the governor considered a political ploy to sway voters. This year's refund will be applied to tax returns.\n\nBefore the 2022 refund, TABOR refunds were relatively small, when they existed.\n\nDuring the hearing on HB 1311, Natalie Menten of the TABOR Foundation noted that refunds have totaled $11.7 billion over 30 years, most of which have been in the last few years.\n\nTaxpayers have given up three times that amount for various state purposes, such as voter approval of Proposition 123 for affordable housing in 2022. That's expected to tap $270 million annually from the TABOR surplus.\n\n\"How is that fair?\" Menten asked during the HB 1311 hearing. \"How is it fair that you continue to take money from somebody who's making a moderate income?\"\n\nJon Caldara of the Independence Institute says the tax credits are a form of wealth redistribution.\n\n\"It's maddening,\" he told Colorado Politics.\n\n\"Let's keep in mind that candidate (and now governor) Jared Polis campaigned on ending special interest tax breaks and use that excess money to lower income taxes,\" Caldara said. Lawmakers \"are sucking away that extra revenue so there will never be another income tax cut,\" he said.\n\nIf the governor wants to lower income taxes -- a request he makes annually in his State of the State address, although he's never backed any proposals to do so in the General Assembly -- he needs to end these tax breaks for special interests, even the \"warm and fuzzy\" ones, Caldara said.\n\nA white paper from the Independence Institute noted that in his 2020 State of the State, Polis said he was \"enthusiastic about working to deliver permanent income tax relief, and we should continue down the path of eliminating tax breaks for special interests so that we can lower rates for everyone without reducing state revenue.\"\n\nInstead, the governor and the legislature have adopted more tax breaks, the white paper claimed, resulting in a $200 million smaller TABOR surplus for 2024-25, the Independence Institute said.\n\nFrizell, who sits on the finance committee, said spending down the surplus is a carve-out for special interest groups and taking money away from everyone.\n\n\"It shouldn't be directed to pet projects and special interest groups,\" she said.\n\n\"You have to look at how (the TABOR surplus) is being tapped\" and for whom, she said. As for HB 1312, she said she finds it problematic since it's intended to \"supplement income.\"\n\n\"This is a free market issue,\" Frizell said. \"If we have a need for care workers, and nobody is disputing that, we need to pay them appropriately. It's not the role of the state to incentivize that behavior and those professions.\"\n\nDiverting funding to these groups is not sustainable, she added.\n\nAnd what happens when the surplus disappears?\n\nThat's the $2 billion question, Frizell said, adding she worries about imposing obligations on the state that may not be sustainable.\n\n\"It's our money. It's our citizens' money. If (the surplus) ends, we don't get our money back,\" she said, adding she also worries that the tax credits will create a sense of entitlement.\n\nThe big questions remain: How many of these tax credits will make it to the governor's desk? And which approach does he favor? Or does he prefer not tapping TABOR at all?\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Dalits are ready to realise their dreams by breaking the stereotypes to emerge socially and economically stronger. In an interview to Shubhangi Khapre he says Viksit Dalit is going to become a reality by 2047. Excerpts:\n\nI will say with absolute certainty that this is the right time for the aspirational dalits to go begin startups. With a perfect ecosystem, those vying for entrepreneurship should capitalise the opportunity provided through Mudra and other startup schemes.\n\nWhat about the social and financial support system?\n\nThe DICCI working with the Union government of India has created what is now described as the 3M approach - Money, Mar-kets and Mentoring- for Sched-uled Caste-Scheduled Tribes (SC- ST) entrepreneurs. This is in adherence to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's vision of economic empowerment of the SC-STs.\n\nDoes it translate into reality?\n\nThe statistics don't lie. I have closely worked with policy making to its execution. I can say the total number of MSME owned by SC/ STs combined is 1.05 crore. In April 2015, the Government of India made 4 per cent procurement from SC / ST MSEs mandatory. In the fiscal year 2022-23, procurement from SC-ST entrepreneurs was Rs 1546.86 crore, from 10348 entrepreneurs.\n\nBut getting funds is not that simple, right?\n\nA) This is a misconception. Our role is to lead the eligible candidates through guidance to proper schemes. DICCI plays the role of catalyst informing candidates about financial support ranging from Rs.50,000 to Rs. 15 crore available to SC-ST entrepreneurs through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (Support from 50,000 to 10 lakh without collateral).\n\nMudra is the biggest ever measure in financial inclusion that has benefited SC-STs in India. The cumulative statistics for 9 years in FY 2022-23 show:\n\nIn terms of financial support, General received INR 18.01 lakh crore, SC received INR 2.87 lakh crore, ST received INR 1.04 lakh crore, and OBC received 5.76 lakh crore.\n\nWhat is DICCI's role in addressing the socio-economic issues?\n\nOur larger objective is economic empowerment of the dalits. I believe that dalits are a politically very aware class, both about their past and present struggles and challenges. The literacy level is 75 percent. It has to rise up to 100 per cent.\n\nIn 2024, Modi talks about Viksit Bharat? Where do dalits stand in the 2024 polls?\n\nI am not a politician. In Viksit Bharat 2047, I see Viksit dalit. The aspirational dalits are moving forward embracing diverse and newer fields like artificial intelligence, technology, communications.

Nowhere is this more evident than in Zimbabwe, where President Mnangagwa's Second Republic has risen to the challenge of combating the El Nino-induced drought with compassion, determination and inclusivity.\n\nAs the country grapples with the devastating effects of the drought caused by the global climate crisis, President Mnangagwa's administration has embarked on a bold and unprecedented initiative to distribute 81 000 tonnes of grain to vulnerable families across the nation.\n\nThis monumental effort reflects not only the Government's commitment to addressing food insecurity, but also its unwavering dedication to leaving no one behind, irrespective of political affiliation or geographic location.\n\nThe El Nino-induced drought has wreaked havoc on Zimbabwe's agricultural sector, decimating crops, depleting water sources and leaving millions of people on the brink of starvation.\n\nIn the face of such dire circumstances, President Mnangagwa's administration has acted swiftly and decisively to alleviate the suffering of those most affected by the crisis.\n\nBy mobilising resources, coordinating relief efforts and prioritising the needs of vulnerable communities, the Government has demonstrated its readiness to confront even the most daunting challenges head-on.\n\nCentral to the success of the Government's response has been its unwavering commitment to inclusivity and equity. Against all odds, President Mnangagwa's Second Republic has adopted a principled approach that places the welfare of all Zimbabweans above partisan interests.\n\nIn distributing 81 000 tonnes of grain, the Government has ensured that assistance reaches those who need it most, regardless of their political affiliation or geographic location. This ethos of inclusivity reflects a profound shift in Zimbabwean politics, one that prioritises the common good over narrow self-interest and fosters a sense of national unity and solidarity.\n\nMoreover, President Mnangagwa's administration has recognised the importance of engaging with local communities and leveraging their expertise and resilience in responding to the drought crisis.\n\nBy working closely with traditional leaders, community organisations and civil society groups, the Government has been able to identify and address the unique needs of different regions and communities, ensuring that relief efforts are targeted, effective and sustainable.\n\nThis collaborative approach not only enhances the impact of Government interventions, but also empowers communities to take ownership of their own development and resilience-building efforts.\n\nIn addition to its immediate relief efforts, the Government has already been prioritising long-term solutions to address the root causes of food insecurity and vulnerability to drought.\n\nThrough initiatives such as the Command Agriculture and the famous Pfumvudza/Intwasa programmes, which promote climate-smart agricultural practices and sustainable land management techniques, President Mnangagwa's administration is laying the groundwork for a more resilient and food-secure future.\n\nBy investing in irrigation infrastructure, promoting drought-resistant crops and providing training and support to smallholder farmers, the Government is empowering communities to adapt to the changing climate and build a more sustainable agricultural sector.\n\nFurthermore, President Mnangagwa's administration has recognised the importance of international cooperation and partnership, for example, with Russia donating 25 000 tonnes of grain in response to combat the effects of the El Nino-induced drought crisis.\n\nTherefore, through partnerships with international organisations, donor agencies and neighbouring countries, Zimbabwe has been able to access additional resources and expertise to augment its own efforts. This spirit of collaboration underscores the interconnected nature of global challenges such as climate change and food insecurity and highlights the importance of collective action in addressing them.\n\nAs Zimbabwe recently celebrated its 44th year of independence on April 18, the Government's response to the El Nino-induced drought crisis serves as a powerful testament to the resilience, resourcefulness and compassion of the Zimbabwean people.\n\nIn the face of adversity, President Mnangagwa's administration has demonstrated true leadership by mobilising resources, fostering collaboration and prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable.\n\nAs the country looks to the future, it does so with renewed hope and determination, confident in its ability to overcome the challenges that lie ahead and build a brighter, more prosperous future for all Zimbabweans, leaving no one and no place behind.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/President-Mnangagwa-3.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 452043896, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a60"}

Six months on from the October 7 attacks, and with the Israeli scorched-earth response ongoing, it seemed timely to talk again to Loewenstein.\n\nHis thesis is that repressive states crave the battle-proven defence and surveillance technology Israel has deployed in Gaza.\n\n\"On the face of it, October 7 shows Israel's multi-billion-dollar intelligence military apparatus failed,\" he says. \"Israel was caught asleep at the wheel, the military disappeared for hours, the wall, the surveillance, all disappeared or was knocked out by Hamas very effectively.\n\n\"You would think that would diminish the image of Israel as a technical marvel. I would argue that in fact the opposite is happening.\"\n\nAgainst the background of entire suburbs being flattened by Israeli munitions, and seemingly every movement of Palestinians - would-be guerrillas and civilians alike - tracked by drones and sensors, personal direct text messages being monitored and the exploration and destruction of the Hamas tunnel network, Israeli defence companies have continued to exhibit at major arms shows and sell their technology.\n\n\"Israel has spent the past six months testing and showing huge amounts of new weapons: drones, quadcopters, surveillance tech and various other equipment in Gaza,\" says Loewenstein. \"It's too early to know exactly who's buying that equipment. We do know, in the past six months, for example, that Israel has had a large presence at arms fairs.\"\n\nStocks soar\n\nAlthough some technology failed on October 7, the incursion was mostly seen as a governmental and intelligence failure to which the answer might be more gear.\n\n\"The companies that have deployed the technology and other surveillance tech on the border that failed haven't taken a step back. If anything, they've simply, very clinically, said, 'Let's not look at the past. Let's focus on the fact that we are now the saviours of Israel.' In other words, 'You need us to protect Israel.\"'\n\nThe main publicly listed Israeli defence companies - IAI, Elbit, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems - have done record business since the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago and their stock prices have generally performed strongly this year.\n\nGlobal interest\n\nLife for Loewenstein has become more intense, as it has for many Jews in the diaspora, as well as in Israel. His book was somehow even more relevant and people worldwide wanted to know more about the failure of Israeli intelligence represented by the October 7 massacre and the implications of the devastating response.\n\n\"It's been very, very difficult. My book came out before October 7 and was doing pretty well. I got a lot of attention. Then October 7 happened and it's just exploded in ways that I could never have imagined. I wake up every day to interview requests from every corner of the globe.\"\n\nThe Sydney-based Loewenstein was already no stranger to attacks from fellow Jews and come-what-may backers of Israel. His journalism has been highly critical of the Israeli state and what he sees as decades of repression of Palestinians. His 2007 book, My Israel Question, was a searing indictment of Zionism and his rejection of it as a Jew.\n\nHe says Israel is profiting financially and in regional and global influence by demonstrating its military effectiveness and the depth of its monitoring capabilities. Far from failing on October 7 - a failing that may land on the military and not its equipment - Israel is exploiting the power of its weaponry deployed in Gaza.\n\nArab states that signed the so-called Abraham Accords (United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco) to normalise relations with Israel under the Trump administration have stuck with the relationship, as has Saudi Arabia, which had been close to establishing normal relations before October 7.\n\nIn each case, the authoritarian regimes may pay lip service to suppressed domestic protests against the Israeli destruction of Gaza, but in the end, Loewenstein believes, their political elites want access to Israel and its technology.\n\n\"None of them have cut ties and none of them will. I'm talking about the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Bahrainis, the list goes on. They know their people, in general, are very against what Israel is doing. And, to some extent, they have to show deference to that anger.\n\n\"But ultimately, I would argue that these nations are increasingly fearful of their own people for a range of reasons of which Palestine is one among many. They feel like they need the most sophisticated, repressive technology that they're buying from Israel to control their own people.\"\n\nLoewenstein expresses gloom about the outlook for Palestinians and for Israel, a country he sees as in the grip of a right wing that dehumanises Palestinians. Israel, he says, has no intention of bowing to what he sees as illusory and performative demands for a two-state solution - one which all who talk about it cynically know will never happen.\n\nIsrael radicalised\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be personally unpopular, but his policies and the right-wing elements in his coalition are popular, especially after October 7. Loewenstein says Israel is increasingly on a course that assumes Israeli ethnic superiority. Its uncompromising stance combines with extreme ideas of the end of days on the religious right to create sometimes odd bedfellows on the hard right of populist politics worldwide, especially given the history of the Holocaust.\n\n\"There is a major constituency in Israel for an ongoing war for endless occupation. Israeli society has been radicalised very strongly for years. October 7 has certainly made that even stronger.\"\n\nThe hideous bragging videos of atrocities and the dehumanisation of Palestinians posted by Israeli soldiers involve \"not just a few bad apples,\" he says. \"No. A massive amount of Israeli soldiers in cars are filming themselves on TikTok dehumanising Palestinians and this is not a handful of soldiers. This is ubiquitous.\"\n\nDuring our Zoom conversation, Loewenstein made a striking observation that put the scale of the destruction in Gaza into a historical context - one which should have been obvious but was somehow lost in the immediacy of the conflict: this war has displaced hundreds of thousands more people than the expulsion (or withdrawal, depending on who is telling the story) of Palestinians in 1948. The UN estimates 1.7 million people have been displaced in Gaza. In 1948, about 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled the region.\n\nKnown to Palestinians as the Nakba or Catastrophe, it is the origin of the occupation of the West Bank, the creation of an isolated Gaza Strip, and the status of Palestinians as refugees in camps created in that era, many of which are still there 75 years later. It's a scary calculus when you think how long the effects of the war against Hamas may last. \"What's happening now is on a scale far bigger than 1948. There's more displacement. And the killing was not even close to where we are now,\" he says of the more than 33,000 people reported killed in Gaza.\n\n\"We all know that this is going to take literally decades to rebuild.\"\n\nHe expects a generational explosion of anti-Israel and anti-Western sentiment across the Arab world.\n\nSlow dawning\n\nWith most domestic media in Israel reporting a strongly Israeli perspective on the conflict, and with social media tending to channel discussion into pre-existing camps, Loewenstein sees no sign that the Israeli public recognise the scale of the Gaza crisis or the likelihood they will live with its consequences for decades to come.\n\nNetanyahu may be the bogeyman, but he represents, or is in cahoots with, a large and robust portion of Israelis and certainly of Israeli hard-right politicians. He continues to face corruption charges, but he may well be replaced by someone just as hardline. Settlers continue to expand territory in the West Bank and even propose going to Gaza.\n\n\"It's fair to say that it's hard not to be even more despairing now than I would have been when we spoke [last July],\" Loewenstein says. \"Things are so grim. The only silver lining, in a way, is that there are growing numbers of young Jews who have been at the forefront of opposition to what's going on, mostly in the US, UK, Jewish Voice for Peace [for example]. They're a minority, but they're a growing minority.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "its@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "its", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tech@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "tech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/QR262UV6TZEEJCGA7CGIADA27E.jpg?auth=680a535794b5c19f590d567f5dca29d9a862b8e9a2a225abbac2cbeaf78ce3fd&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "eventUri": "eng-9515473", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 452043809, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a61"}

At the start of the year, the talk in Canberra was that the Labor government may call an early election to ride the momentum of rate cuts anticipated in the second half.\n\nNow, with at least one analyst -- Capital Economics -- predicting a hike at next week's RBA meeting, prospects of an early relief from lower rates are fading. Money markets have switched from pricing in strong chances of a cut this year to now ascribing a near-60% probability of another 25-basis-point increase to 4.6% - a level last seen in October 2011.\n\nRead more: RBA's Guarded Policy Stance Highlights Sticky Inflation Worries\n\nAustralians are caught in a squeeze of rising prices and high borrowing costs, with a Resolve poll last week showing over half of respondents describing themselves as being on the brink of economic hardship. The survey finds that only 27% of voters trusted Labor on economic management, down from almost 40% two years ago.\n\nThe Labor government does have one ace up its sleeve, with tax cuts due to begin in July. But given that Australia has some of the world's highest household debt, rate cuts are potentially more significant. With lingering inflation pressures, Treasurer Jim Chalmers faces a tricky balancing act when he hands down the annual budget on May 14.\n\n\"On the one hand, Labor would really like to stimulate economic growth,\" said Zareh Ghazarian, a senior lecturer in politics at Monash University. \"But on the other hand, any attempts to do so will presumably lift the inflation rate.\"\n\nAustralia, like much of the developed world, had seen consumer prices steadily fall back from a 2022 peak, leading money markets to confidently price in rate cuts this year. But concerns that the \"last mile\" for inflation to return to the RBA's 2%-3% target will take longer have now come to the fore.\n\nThe RBA raised rates 13 times between May 2022 and November 2023 to try to get control over inflation. Unlike the US, most households in Australia have floating-rate mortgages, meaning rate hikes flow quickly through to monthly repayments. Governor Michele Bullock recently highlighted that this makes RBA policy tightening much more potent.\n\n\"The risks to easing too soon, and so eroding inflation's return to target, are significant and so it's appropriate that the market now does not expect the RBA to cut rates this year,\" said Jonathan Kearns, chief economist at money manager Challenger Ltd. and a former senior RBA official.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\"Consumers are already very unhappy and that's been prolonged already. Stretching it further could hurt the government.\"\n\nOne place where inflation pressures remain particularly acute is in housing rental costs, which at an annual 7.7% in the first quarter are around the highest level recorded in the 30 years that the RBA has targeted inflation.\n\nLabor's economic strategy of running a tight fiscal policy to buttress tight monetary policy and bring down inflation early in its term was based on the idea that, later on, a combination of tax cuts, lower rates and increased fiscal spending would ease the pain and smooth the path to reelection.\n\nLabor is currently only narrowly ahead of the opposition Liberal-National coalition two years into its first term in office. The latest Newspoll survey showed Albanese's party leading 51% to 49% on a two-party preferred basis.\n\nAlbanese currently holds power only by a couple of seats in Australia's 151-member lower house of parliament and if an election was held today, Labor may be forced into minority government, relying on independent lawmakers and smaller parties to maintain its grip.\n\n\"If the government doesn't have a positive story to tell in terms of its economic strategy, then convincing voters who are sitting on the fence becomes much harder,\" said Ghazarian.\n\n--With assistance from Tomoko Sato and Garfield Reynolds.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

No one else, however, saw it that way. The public reaction has been overwhelmingly one of disgust (unsurprisingly to everyone except perhaps Noem herself.)\n\nNoem initially defended herself on social media by arguing that shooting pets in the head is just a normal part of farm work. Now she is arguing again in a longer post, in which she implies that anyone upset is just holding a grudge too long (after all, she says, the shooting was 20 years ago) and demands people acknowledge that this was an example of being a \"responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor.\" She declares, in part:\n\n\"The fact is, South Dakota law states that dogs who attack and kill livestock can be put down. Given that Cricket had shown aggressive behavior toward people by biting them, I decided what I did.\"\n\nThat's a significant shift from her initial story, that she shot the dog because it was \"less than worthless\" and at 14 months had not yet been successfully trained into a hunting animal. In the book, she says she hated the pet and describes shooting it in a fit of emotion after the pup failed to kill quail, and attacked chickens instead.\n\nIf you're trying to back up your behavior, and the best you can come up with is that it's not illegal, you've already lost the moral argument.\n\nAnd nope, the voters and general public aren't letting it go, even after Noem insisted:\n\n\"I followed the law and was being a responsible parent, dog owner, and neighbor.\"\n\nInstead, they're calling her out for revamping her story to justify her actions.\n\nShe's being called out for changing her story, and for expecting sympathy.\n\nWidespread speculation is that she has ended her own political career.\n\nPlenty of folks are pointing out that the failure was Noem's. She was responsible for training her pet -- the puppy wasn't responsible for knowing better on its own.\n\nAnd the memes are getting brutal (though not a fraction as brutal as shooting a puppy).\n\nPeople are even pointing out that animal abuse often correlates with escalating violence and even serial killers.\n\nGeorge Conway is leading a movement to donate to animal shelters near Noem.\n\nAnd one social media user says he's collected photos of dogs to send to Noem, to let her know that these pets, at least, are out of her reach.\n\nEven major MAGA influencers like Catturd are calling out Noem's actions. In the post below, he says shooting the pup was unjustifiable, and in a separate post, he offered to take in \"untrainable\" dogs.\n\nWhat about untrainable politicians?

Biden tries humor on the campaign trail\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is out to win some votes by scoring some laughs at the expense of Donald Trump. Biden is using mockery with the goal of getting under Trump's skin and reminding the country of Trump's blunders. Like a comic honing his routine, the Democratic president has been testing and expanding his jokes over the past few weeks. It started with jabs about his Republican opponent's financial problems, and now Biden regularly jeers Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and much more. The jokes are the latest attempt to crack the code on how to clap back at Trump, whose own schtick has redrawn the boundaries of what's acceptable in modern politics.\n\nDonald Trump is running against Joe Biden. But he keeps bringing up another Democrat: Jimmy Carter\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Donald Trump is running against Joe Biden, but Trump keeps bringing up another Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Trump likes to cite the 99-year-old Carter as a measuring stick to belittle Biden. Trump calls Carter a happy man because, according to Trump, Biden's performance in office makes Carter's presidency look good in comparison. It was once common for Republicans to mock Carter, who lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan in 1980 amid inflation, energy shortages and the Iran hostage crisis. Trump's implication is that Biden's economy makes Carter's look better. Federal figures show today's economy is stronger and more stable than in the late 1970s. And over the years, Carter's overall presidency has gotten stronger assessments from historians.\n\nTornadoes kill 4 in Oklahoma, leaving trail of destruction and thousands without power\n\nSULPHUR, Okla. (AP) -- Tornadoes have killed four people in Oklahoma and left thousands without power. The tornadoes began late Saturday night and left at least 100 people injured around Oklahoma. One tornado destroyed several downtown buildings in Sulphur, Oklahoma, flipping over cars and shearing rooftops off houses across a 15-block radius. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt toured the destruction on Sunday and said every business in the town of Sulphur appeared to have been destroyed. Oklahoma's severe weather adds to the dozens of reported tornadoes that have wreaked havoc in the nation's midsection since Friday. Authorities said Sunday that one person also died in Iowa because of the storms.\n\nPutin likely didn't order death of Russian opposition leader Navalny, US official says\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely didn't order the death of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny in February. An official says the U.S. intelligence community has found \"no smoking gun\" that Putin was aware of the timing of Navalny's death or directly ordered it. The official says it's believed Putin was ultimately responsible for the death of Navalny, who endured brutal conditions during his confinement. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. Navalny was Russia's best-known opposition politician and died while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he called politically motivated. A month later, Putin won reelection.\n\nPassage of harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law in Iraq draws diplomatic backlash\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) -- Human rights groups and diplomat have criticized a law that was quietly passed by the Iraqi parliament over the weekend that would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people. Although homosexuality is taboo in the largely conservative Iraqi society and political leaders have periodically launched anti-LGBTQ campaigns, Iraq did not previously have a law that explicitly criminalized it. The law passed Saturday with little notice as an amendment to the country's existing anti-prostitution law, imposes a sentence of 10 to 15 years for same-sex relations and a prison term of one to three years for people who undergo or perform gender-transition surgeries and for \"intentional practice of effeminacy.\"\n\nAfrican farmers look to the past and the future to address climate change\n\nHARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- From ancient fertilizer methods in Zimbabwe to new greenhouse technology in Somalia, farmers across the heavily agriculture-reliant African continent are looking both to the past and future to respond to climate change. Africa has the world's youngest population. It is seeing the worst effects of a warming planet while contributing the least to the problem. Farmers are scrambling to make sure the booming population is fed. Some are turning to traditional foods that had been long dismissed as weeds or neglected in favor of imports. Others embrace new planting methods and varieties. One new bean's side benefit is less flatulence.\n\nObstacles remain as women seek more leadership roles in America's Black Church\n\nThroughout its long history, the Black Church in America has - for the most part - been a patriarchal institution, with men making up the vast majority of its ranks of clergy. These days, increasing numbers of Black women are attending seminary, and some women are carving out high-profile leadership roles. The African Methodist Episcopal Church says it has more than 1,000 female pastors. But obstacles remain. The founder of a group called Women of Color in Ministry estimates that less than one in 10 Black Protestant congregations are led by a woman.\n\nCandace Parker, a 3-time WNBA champion and 2-time Olympic gold medalist, announces retirement\n\nThree-time WNBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Candace Parker has announced she's retiring after 16 seasons. Parker wrote in a social media post on Sunday that she refuses to cheat the game and has decided to call it a career at 38 years old. Parker became the first player in WNBA history to be named Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in the same season in 2008. She also is the only player in league history to win a championship with three different teams.

If confirmed, The National has taken a look at who are the early favourites in the SNP leadership race.\n\nA former finance secretary with a reputation for being a capable minister and personable leader, Forbes is perhaps considered the frontrunner in the race to take over at the head of the SNP.\n\nShe came second to Yousaf in the 2023 SNP leadership election, which was run in the wake of Nicola Sturgeon's resignation. She won 48% of the membership vote to Yousaf's 52%, once third-place contender Ash Regan was eliminated.\n\nForbes is seen as representing a more conservative - fiscally and socially - side of the SNP than Yousaf.\n\nThe current Education Secretary, Gilruth was the first MSP to go on leadership manoeuvres after Yousaf's plunged into crisis with the ending of the Bute House Agreement - if Holyrood rumours are to be believed.\n\nGilruth also served in more junior ministerial roles in Nicola Sturgeon's government, holding culture and then transport portfolios, and is also considered a competent minister.\n\nThe Energy Secretary (as well as Wellbeing Economy and Net Zero), McAllan is widely seen as a future SNP leader.\n\nHowever, McAllan, a former lawyer, is due to have her first child in July and she is expected to take maternity leave from her role as a government minister until early 2025.\n\nIt seems likely that McAllan will wait this leadership race out.\n\nThere are rumours that Stephen Flynn, the SNP's leader at Westminster, fancies his chances of taking control of the entire party. However, he is an MP, not an MSP.\n\nNot having a seat in the Scottish Parliament means he could not become first minister, a major stumbling block for any prospective SNP leader, and one which means Flynn may not throw his hat into the ring for leadership just yet.\n\nA close ally of Humza Yousaf, Gray is Health Secretary. He took on a government role after ditching his Westminster seat and running to become an MSP in the 2021 Holyrood elections.\n\nWhether Gray will look to go for the leadership is in question, despite whispers saying his name in the Scottish Parliament corridors.\n\nA real outsider in terms of actually taking over from Yousaf, there have been whispers of Swinney stepping in as a caretaker first minister.\n\nA former deputy first minister under Nicola Sturgeon, and a former SNP leader himself, Swinney is seen as a safe pair of hands who is respected across the political spectrum.\n\nHowever, he has publicly stated his intention to step back from frontline politics, so anything other than the briefest caretaker role is realistically beyond expectations.", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/18020690/", "eventUri": "eng-9512449", "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 452043559, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a67"}

According to Wikipedia: \"If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\n\n(Yet) the lie can be maintained only for such a time as the state can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the state.\n\n\" We aren't here dealing with the power of the state to lie to the people, to serve certain ends, but the proclivity of politicians to lie to the public, to gain political points and mileage over their opponents. That's the scenario playing out in Edo State in the lead-up to the September 21, 2024, governorship election.\n\nIt's almost two weeks that the unusual - and uncommon in our clime - reportedly took place in Uromi, headquarters of Esan North-East Local Government Area of Edo Central in Edo State: That the family members of the \"Okpebholo dynasty\" in Uromi had declared their support for the candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr Asue Ighodalo. \"Reportedly\" because politics is like magic: the more you look, the less you see.\n\nIn politics, anything can happen, as anything can be \"arranged\" to look real, especially \"when money talks and changes hands.\" That's why opponents are quick to debunk \"defections\" from their political platforms to others, before the gambit grows wings of reality. The undisguised impression created in the public by organisers of the Okpebholo family's \"defection\" to the PDP, as first reported by The Conclave on April 18, is that the family - settling in a different location - is related to the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Monday Okpebholo (Edo Central).\n\nIt's on this premise that one allowed almost a fortnight's benefit of the doubt - even as a two-week period is more than a lifetime in politics - to see if Okpebholo would clarify that the family members at Amedokhian community in Uromi, who decamped to the PDP, and declared their support for Ighodalo on April 17, are related or unrelated to his family from Udomi-Uwessan community of Irrua, Esan Central Local Government Area of Edo Central in Edo State.\n\n(Sen. Okpebholo was born on August 29, 1970, at Udomi-Uwessan, Irrua, where he had his early education at the Udomi Community Primary School and Ujabhole Community Secondary School, both in Irrua, before he completed his secondary education and obtained his senior school certificate in Jos, Plateau State, and received a degree in Business Administration from the University of Abuja, where he's undergoing a Masters' degree in Policy and Leadership Studies.)\n\nBut one hasn't heard, seen, or read about an affirmation or a denial from Okpebholo in the media. Perhaps, that may come on the campaign trail, which officially began on Wednesday, April 24, going by the guidelines of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for full-fledged electioneering that'll end at midnight on Thursday, September 19.\n\nWhile the public expects a plausible explanation from Okpebholo or the leadership of the APC in its Edo State chapter, it's curious to know if - before the campaigns commenced - the candidate and the party had a media arm. If they had, did they bar the outfit from publicising their activities - or giving access to the prying and nosey media to do the same - until they \"hit the ground running\" after INEC would've blown the whistle for earnest campaigns? In that regard, can they cover the lost ground - particularly ceded to the seemingly well-oiled media arm of the campaign organisation of the rival PDP and its candidate, Ighodalo - and meet the expectations of the APC leadership, mostly President Bola Tinubu - who, while handing over the party flag to Sen. Okpebholo and his running, Hon. Dennis Idahosa (APC, Ovia Federal Constituency) at the State House, Abuja, on March 18, described them as \"giant killers\"? At a gathering of party stalwarts for the ceremony, Tinubu, sounding upbeat about the APC winning the governorship, declared: \"Distinguished senator and our flag bearer, we are putting you forward in order to hold the party in trust for us and achieve victory for us.\n\nYou and your running mate have been described as 'giant killers,' and you have worked tirelessly with the party leadership. \"We are going to work with you. We are going to stand with you like the wall (Rock) of Gibraltar. That is all I can assure you. The party is supreme but victory is superior and very important.\n\n\" The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) first reported the story. Both Okpebholo and Idahosa - on their way to the National Assembly (NASS) - defeated incumbents at the poll, and are expected to wave the same or similar political magic wand, to win in September and restore the APC to power at the Osadebey Avenue Government House in Benin City, the Edo State capital city. Okpebholo, Idahosa, the APC and its leader in Edo State, Sen. and former Governor Adams Oshiomhole - who \"anointed\" Idahosa for the governorship, and had to settle for the deputy slot after Okpebholo won the twice-held primary - have barely five months to turn things around in the proxy battle of incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki and Comrade Oshiomhole to install their \"anointed\" candidates, respectively.\n\nParticularly for Oshiomhole, nothing else will suffice, as he strives to avoid a second consecutive defeat of his \"chosen candidates\" by his erstwhile political prot\u00e9g\u00e9-turned traducer, who sponsors Ighodalo, and pulls all stops to ensure the candidate succeeds him in November 2024.\n\nRecall that Obaseki, running for his re-election in 2020 - after Oshiomhole, as then Chairman of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC, denied him the party ticket, and forced him to decamp to the PDP - defeated Oshiomhole's choice candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who was also the PDP candidate in the 2016 governorship poll against Obaseki, then of the APC. Oshiomhole's, however, promised - with the joint efforts of the APC candidates and members of the party - to reclaim Edo State from the PDP.\n\nHe made the pledge in a congratulatory message to Okpebholo after he picked Idahosa as his running mate on March 17. Oshiomhole said: \"Your decision to choose Hon. Dennis Idahosa as your running mate, demonstrates great wisdom and foresight. Your joint ticket presents the people of Edo State with the best option to usher in a dynamic, progressive, and responsive government that aligns with the aspirations of our vibrant youth population.\n\n\"I am confident in your leadership abilities and believe that, with the support of all APC members across the state, we can restore Edo State to the path of progressive governance, sustainable socio-economic growth and political inclusion in all its ramifications. \"Together, we must forge a strong, united front that resonates with the electorate and secures victory in the governorship election on September 21, 2024.\n\nCongratulations once again, as I eagerly anticipate our collective efforts towards achieving victory in the upcoming election. Yours in the struggle for the rebirth of a greater Edo State that works for all.\" Oshiomhole's lofty expectation of a return of the APC to governance of Edo State is a daunting task and a big challenge to Okpebholo's candidacy that needs bolstering with rapid response to disclaiming the opposition's narratives tending to portray that Okpebholo and the APC are losing ground, and surrendering when the battle has just begun.", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ehichioya_ezomon@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "Ehichioya Ezomon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/download.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9532048", "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 452043530, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a68"}

He's a heck of a hitter too. It was the Tate DeRias show. I don't know how many guys are better than him in the state, but I don't think there's too many.\"\n\nSt. Augustine starter Matt Kouser matched DeRis, throwing seven shutout innings. Kouser allowed four hits and struck out five.\n\n\"He was phenomenal,\" St. Augustine coach Mike Ney said of Kouser. \"He's a gamer. He stepped up and did everything he could do to win the game.

Gloucester Catholic is ranked No. 1 in The Press Elite 11, while the Hermits are No. 3.\n\n\"It's showtime,\" Ney said of the atmosphere. \"You're on the big stage. That's the way we want it.\"\n\nThe game featured plenty of memorable plays. St. Augustine center fielder Jake Meyers chased down a flyball in the gap and threw to first base to double off a Gloucester Catholic runner.\n\nSt. Augustine had its chances to score first.\n\nThe Hermits had runners and first and second with one out in the seventh. They loaded the bases with one out in the eighth. But they couldn't take advantage of either opportunity. The eighth was particularly frustrating because it ended when Ryan Williams lined out to third base.\n\n\"Everyone was trying to find a way to win,\" Ney said. \"Unfortunately, a hit here or there, a sacrifice fly. It just didn't go our way. That's baseball.\"\n\nAs the sun began to drop, the Rams finally scored the game's only run. The Hermits walked the bases loaded in the 11th. With the infield in, DeRias slashed a hard-hit ground ball. Second baseman Brady Jackson knocked it down to save an additional run, but DeRias was safe at first and the Rams were up 1-0.\n\nDespite the defeat, Ney was upbeat afterward.\n\n\"We can compete with anybody,\" Ney said. \"I think the guys showed a lot today, showed a lot of heart. They are a very good baseball team, but so are we. If we get to where we want to be at the end of the season, we're going to be in games like this. We got a little battle-tested today. You want to win them all. You're not going to win them all.

However, candidates from Parti Rakyat Malaysia Hafizah Zainuddin and independent Nyau Ke Xin were nowhere to be seen, so far.\n\nNyau said she will only start campaigning today while PRM assistant election director Koh Swe Yong said they will set up their operations centre today.\n\nAccording to Balakong assemblyman Ong Chun Wei, he believes that despite the slow-paced campaigns, discussions at the coffee shops are lively, with many people talking about the candidates after meals.\n\n\"Nomination day and Sunday saw people returning home, making it easier for candidates to meet with voters.\n\n\"Many shops are closed on Monday and we expect things to be quiet,\" he added.\n\nUniversiti Teknologi Malaysia's Razak Faculty Perdana Centre political analyst Dr Mazlan Ali said the sluggish start to campaigning is common in the early stages, adding that the momentum will increase in the second week.\n\nIlham centre executive director Hisomudin Bakar said the \"cold\" ground in public reception towards election campaigns has been the norm in the previous by-elections.\n\nHe added that campaigning is expected to heat up closer to the May 11 polling day, where political titans will attend the ceramah.\n\n\"I'm expecting the mood to be gloomy...

The campaign isn't slow - it is smooth,\" he said.\n\nHe believed that the relatively calm campaigning period is probably due to the ongoing Hari Raya Aidilfitri mood among locals.\n\n\"People are not so focused on politics as they are spending time with their families,\" he said.\n\nHe expected things to heat up at the end of the first week of campaigning, as Perikatan is set to organise huge events, among which is a mega ceramah on May 4 featuring the four Mentris Besar from Perikatan.\n\n\"We will arrange a stage for the four Mentris Besar of Perikatan from Perlis, Terengganu, Kelantan and Kedah,\" he added.\n\nDAP deputy chairman Gobind Singh Deo said Pakatan will not change its election strategy due to the four-cornered contest.\n\n\"There are different kinds of problems in every constituency.

Nic Antaya/Washington Post\n\nDEARBORN, Mich. - Abdullah Hammoud had been outspoken about Israel's assault in Gaza and President Biden's unconditional support of Israel for nearly four months, but he had not attracted much attention outside his native Dearborn. That all changed in late January, when he made a decision that would catapult him from little-known mayor to national figure.\n\nBiden's campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, was coming to town, a fellow Arab American official told Hammoud. How would the Dearborn mayor feel about meeting with her?\n\nSomething didn't sit right with Hammoud.\n\nIsrael's military campaign in Gaza had killed more than 25,000 Palestinians. Hammoud had heard from residents of this majority Arab American city who had lost 20, 40, even 80, relatives. The war was spreading to southern Lebanon and Yemen, where many of Dearborn's residents had ancestral roots. This was the first outreach he had received from anyone in the Biden camp and it was not a White House official with the ability to influence policy, but someone whose sole job was getting the president reelected.\n\nHammoud, a Democratic mayor of a city of just over 100,000 residents, made a decision that sent an unmistakable message: He turned down the meeting.\n\n\"That was a concept people couldn't understand: 'Why would you do that?'\" Hammoud said in a recent interview while driving around Dearborn. \"Immediately when I got the invitation, I felt like it was a disingenuous engagement. It was an engagement only for the worry of what's going to happen in the upcoming election, and not for the worry of what's actually happening to the people on the ground and to their friends and family and my residents.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Hammoud, the first Arab American and Muslim mayor of Dearborn, has had to navigate myriad crosscurrents. He has spoken with White House officials - though not campaign operatives - who have looked to him to try to understand his constituents' anger at the president, and what it might take to win them back. He has become a prominent voice for Arab American and Muslim voters, not just in Dearborn but across the country, who say that Biden has betrayed and dehumanized them.\n\nAnd still, the 34-year-old Hammoud has to keep his attention on the job he was elected to do: overseeing the city of Dearborn. He now spends hours discussing foreign policy and the political fallout of Biden's support of Israel. But his days are filled with meetings about budgets, flooding, community parks and city events.\n\n\"I ran for office on the idea that I'd ensure your garbage was picked up on time,\" Hammoud said. He has received numerous invitations for dinners and speaking engagements related to the war, but he has turned most of them down. \"It's humbling,\" he said. \"But I try to tell folks I'm still the mayor of Dearborn, and this is my primary focus.\"\n\nAfter rejecting the meeting with Chavez Rodriguez, Hammoud made clear that he would only meet with policymakers, not campaign operatives. Two weeks later, the White House sent a high-level delegation to Dearborn that included Jon Finer, Biden's deputy national security adviser, and Samantha Power, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe Israel-Gaza war is, on its face, a foreign policy issue thousands of miles away from a midsize city in Michigan. But it occupies a unique space in Dearborn, where it has in essence become a local issue, now consuming the community for more than six months. The city is a little more than 50 percent Arab American and sits in a swing state that is crucial to Biden's path to a second term.\n\nResidents have organized dozens of protests and fundraisers since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 253 others hostage into Gaza, according to Israeli authorities. In response, Israel launched a punishing military assault that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, the majority of whom are women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's siege of the enclave has also created a humanitarian catastrophe as Gaza's health system has collapsed and its residents face famine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichigan is home to the nation's largest Arab American and Muslim population, with about 300,000 people who claim ancestry from the Middle East or North Africa, and that community overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020. Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes in 2020 and is expected to face another tight contest this year against former president Donald Trump.\n\nAlong the way, Dearborn has become the informal headquarters of a movement among progressives to withhold their votes from Biden in November. Activists in the city helped organize a campaign urging voters to choose \"uncommitted\" in the Michigan Democratic primary in February, an effort that garnered more than 100,000 votes and spread to other swing states. Those election protests have now been joined by demonstrations at numerous college campuses across the country.\n\nAgainst that highly charged backdrop, Hammoud faces furiously competing pressures. Many Arab Americans and Muslims view meetings with Biden or his top aides as pointless or even a betrayal. And many Democrats, while sympathetic to the community's anger, believe Hammoud has a responsibility to help convince his constituents - as well as Arab Americans and Muslims across the country - to vote for Biden and prevent a second Trump term.\n\n\"I think he's probably the most influential person in the state of Michigan when it comes to the Muslim and Arab American community and young progressives,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who met with Hammoud in February. Khanna is a Biden supporter and surrogate who has strong ties to the Democratic Party's progressive and minority factions.\n\nIf Hammoud does not support Biden, \"I'd be disappointed, because I want the president to win and I think that would make his path more challenging, especially in Michigan,\" Khanna added. \"But I understand this is a matter of conscience for Abdullah and he's true to the community he represents.\"\n\nHammoud has not yet decided whether he will vote for Biden. But he gets asked that nearly every day, and he knows he can only postpone the decision for so long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The whole community wants to know, how do we all march together in one direction? ... How do we demonstrate our power come November, and what are the trade-offs?\" he said. \"Because we also understand that a losing Biden is a winning Trump.\"\n\nKhalid Turaani, co-chair of Michigan's \"Abandon Biden\" campaign, commended Hammoud for deftly navigating these political crosscurrents. But he said he is worried the mayor may ultimately feel pressured to support Biden as a fellow Democrat, which Turaani said would be a \"betrayal.\"\n\n\"It would be a huge disservice to our community, because our community is not going to matter if we don't stand our ground,\" Turaani said.\n\n'No reason for me to be there'\n\nEven before he rose to national prominence, Hammoud wrestled with how to interact with the White House.\n\nHe visited Washington in mid-January, about a week before he turned down the session with Biden's campaign manager, for a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. When Biden hosted the group at the White House, Hammoud skipped the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I did not feel that at this point in time, the administration would be welcoming to a Muslim Arab American. The White House didn't feel like it represented me,\" Hammoud said in an interview in January. \"So I felt like there was no reason for me to be there.\"\n\nMayors of large, prominent cities like New York and Los Angeles often have national profiles. But it is rare for a mayor of a small or midsize city to gain that kind of recognition, let alone for a foreign policy issue.\n\nHammoud did not dream of political life. Born to Lebanese immigrants in Dearborn, he grew up the second of five children in a poor family. His mother dropped out of high school at age 17 after she got married and then pregnant, and his father spent most of Hammoud's childhood as a truck driver delivering steel for auto companies.\n\nHammoud was 12 or 13 when he truly realized his family was poor. A stranger called asking for their address and Hammoud innocently gave it to him, even as his father was bellowing at him from the other room to hang up. A few days later, collections agents showed up at the house.\n\nHammoud initially dreamed of medical school as a path to financial stability, but after he failed to get in, he shifted to public health, and by age 25, he was being interviewed for six-figure jobs at health firms.\n\nThen his life took an unexpected turn. On Oct. 15, 2015, Hammoud's older brother, Ali, who suffered from seizures, called him at 5:29 a.m., saying something felt wrong. Hammoud called an ambulance and ran to his brother's home. Ali went into a seizure, and Hammoud knew before they left the house that his brother, then 27, was dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHammoud dropped his career plans, deciding he wanted to pursue a more meaningful path, and a few weeks later was approached with an opportunity to run for an open state House seat. His parents were against the idea. Politics had ruined Lebanon; why would their son want to become a part of that?\n\nHammoud's father told him in Arabic: \"Don't forget your name is Abdullah Hammoud.\" He didn't think it was possible for an Arab and Muslim to win elected office in America.\n\nBut Hammoud did win, becoming, at age 26, the first Arab American and Muslim elected to represent Michigan's 15th district. After a couple years, Hammoud felt he could have more impact directly overseeing Dearborn than as one of 110 in the state House. He ultimately beat out five other candidates and assumed the mayor's office in January 2022.\n\nMany of Hammoud's experiences growing up have shaped his policies as mayor. He remembers how he and his siblings could not afford the $5 entrance fee to the local pool; during his first summer as mayor, Hammoud made community pools free for all children 13 and under.\n\nAs someone who focused much of his mayoral campaign on the nuts-and-bolts of the city's flooding problem, Hammoud could have never foreseen his rise to become a leading voice on a foreign war.\n\nHis chief adviser through this unlikely maze is his wife, Fatima. Hammoud consults with her nearly every night on when and how he should speak out, what meetings he should take and how he should approach them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatima is wary of the attention that comes with Hammoud's fame, especially after the Wall Street Journal published an editorial in February titled \"Welcome to Dearborn, America's Jihad Capital.\" The article prompted increased threats to Hammoud and the city, including one person who threatened to behead his 2-year-old and then-4-month-old children. But Fatima believes Hammoud has a unique opportunity to advocate on behalf of his Dearborn community.\n\nDuring a recent evening at home, playing with their kids, the two discussed Hammoud's rise and his potential to swing critical voters. Hammoud expressed discomfort at having that kind of impact.\n\n\"Why do you hope you don't influence the election?\" she asked him. \"I hope you do.\"\n\nA careful balance\n\nOn a Tuesday afternoon in March, Hammoud, who was fasting for Ramadan, held meetings on city business. Abed Ayoub, director of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, a national group, made the case for holding its annual conference in Dearborn instead of Washington - a move he argued would be especially meaningful after the Wall Street Journal column. \"If you want to talk to Arab Americans, you're going to do it in our city,\" Ayoub said. \"What we're basically doing is welcoming all Arab Americans home.\" Hammoud agreed.\n\nThe following afternoon, Hammoud stopped in at one of Dearborn's grocery stores as residents were picking up items for iftar, the meal in which Muslims break their fast during Ramadan. Several of the store's employees warmly greeted Hammoud: one man stocking shelves, another behind the meat counter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHammoud knows he will likely face criticism whether he endorses Biden or ultimately announces he cannot support him. Many Muslims and Arab Americans, as well as progressives and people of color, could be swayed by the mayor's decision, and if Biden loses Michigan - and the White House - as a result, Hammoud fears that Arab Americans and Muslims will be blamed for Trump's triumph. Yet casting a vote for Biden now, after his backing of Israel's military onslaught in Gaza, seems unpalatable to many Arab Americans.\n\nFor now, Hammoud is pursuing a careful balance.\n\nBefore meeting with Finer and Power in February, he pored through six hours worth of interviews the two officials had given since the war started; at various points, he read their quotes back to them. He came in with 10 pages of notes not just on Gaza, but on West Bank settlements, sanctions and other issues.\n\nThe meetings between Biden officials and Hammoud, as well as other leaders in Michigan, showed the White House the depth and political impact of the community's anger, according to a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations.\n\nBiden began shifting his rhetoric, calling Israel's military response in Gaza \"over the top.\" He more directly acknowledged Palestinian suffering, and he told Israel there were \"no excuses\" for not allowing in more aid.\n\nHammoud so far has managed to keep his city, as well as Arab and Muslim communities outside of Dearborn, largely united behind him. He has advocated for his residents, and has sought to convey to the White House the sense of betrayal felt by many Arab Americans and Muslims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHammoud has also distanced himself on occasion from the more hard-hitting rhetoric coming from his community. When video emerged earlier this month of protesters in Dearborn chanting \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to America,\" Hammoud publicly condemned it.\n\n\"The Dearborn community stands for peace and justice for all people,\" Hammoud wrote on X. \"We are proud to call this city and this country home.\"\n\nShortly after the Oct. 7 attacks, Hammoud faced criticism for a statement that condemned the killing of innocents but only after blasting Israel's military occupation of Gaza, saying that \"context\" of the decades-long conflict was crucial to understand the unfolding events.\n\nHammoud said he recognizes Biden's shift in tone toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but insisted the president must do more. \"Is it truly a win to say the president no longer casts doubt on how many Palestinians have been killed? Is that the bar in which we as a community are moving forward?\" Hammoud said.\n\nUntil the Gaza war, Hammoud considered Biden one of the best American presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt. His city has won tens of millions of dollars in grants under Biden's infrastructure law. His residents have benefited from the president's health reforms, including a $35 cap on insulin prices.\n\nBut Hammoud says he cannot look past the tens of thousands killed and wounded in Gaza, the millions displaced, the stream of U.S. weapons flowing to Israel.\n\n\"We want the world to see and recognize that humanity is on the ballot in November,\" Hammoud said. \"My biggest fear is that [Biden] is not going to be remembered as the president who saved democracy in 2020 and all this transformative legislation - he's going to be remembered as the president who sided with Benjamin Netanyahu and chose him over American democracy.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: gaza, Israel, President Biden Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/mich-mayor-gaza_IY6YMA4ZQUWZCLWE6TRR4S57JE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9524819", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 452043345, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a6f"}

Too much even. He did not want it. Unnecessary, a burden. His future depended on it.\n\nWhy? That was his only motivation. Don't you see him? He would actually try and it would take him all day. He worked into the night, not enough sleep.\n\nSomehow, despite his extraordinary effort, his grades were less than ideal, and he was intelligent, too. It is as Tolstoy wrote, that the dullest people are the best students. He was a lively young man, always looking around him for something to take interest in. School bored him, but, more than that, it sweated and threatened him.\n\n\"Your friend is here,\" said an assistant.\n\n\"You can sit there.\" The principal opened his hand at seats by the window.\n\n\"Good day,\" said his guest from the school district.\n\n\"Chocolate bar and carrot juice?\" asked the principal.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nHe stepped into a kitchen with piles of food on the counters and returned swiftly. Relieving themselves of the more serious thoughts, they smoked, laughed, ate and talked about everything. They were both full and optimistic by the time the official specifically asked Mr. White, this principal, about the school.\n\n\"I'm working on it.\"\n\n\"There's been an important change at the district, with the curriculum.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"We are rolling out a new special digital curriculum. You can just let us know if your teachers are interested.\"\n\n\"Of course you are.\"\n\n\"It'll help them.\"\n\n\"I'll take a look at it, but I doubt anyone will be interested.\"\n\n\"Let's make cookies!\"\n\n\"I don't want to,\" said a student, \"what if I don't want to? Isn't that the patriarchy, forcing me to bake?\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said another student.\n\nThis interested the teacher.\n\n\"Don't worry about your grade then\" the teacher said.\n\nThe feminist got up and left, without touching her handout, and the teacher was pleased by the philosophical interruption. The student pondered how anyone could make any sense out of it. Why would someone force her to bake, read or write, run or sit.\n\nThe principal had begun wearing a comfortable robe instead of a suit. He was visiting the physics class, walking calmly and gently, his head tilted down slightly, profoundly meditating.\n\n\"What are you doing in the hallway?\" he asked a student out by the classroom door. The physics class was the only one in the portable.\n\n\"I was staring out the window, the teacher noticed, and he said I should wait outside then.\"\n\n\"There's no way you'll succeed without being interested. One moment,\" stepping inside, and concluded upon returning: \"Well, it's like you said. You're free until your next class. It would help if you were interested. Right?\"\n\nThe principal stepped outside, and so did the student, who was friends with the feminist and saw her leaving the school.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked her.\n\n\"Home early to eat and make a smoothie. Want to come?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Are you ahead in all your classes? Why were you out with the principal?\"\n\n\"I didn't like physics. I was excused. You?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to bake for home ec\" she replied seriously.\n\nIt was a large property, with trees all around, at the end of a cul-de-sac without sidewalks. The sun was shining brightly in the fresh blue sky, and the door was open.\n\n\"What do you think about meat?\" as she prepared vegan burgers.\n\n\"I haven't thought about it, I've always eaten it. Don't we need it? What do you think about it?\"\n\n\"I'm writing an article about it for the student paper actually. My mom told me she knew someone with a tooth problem who got a headache whenever he ate meat, and nothing else did that, so he stopped eating meat.\"\n\n\"How do you stay full?\"\n\n\"I eat a lot of healthy avocados.\"\n\n\"What else do you think about?\"\n\n\"My mom! Here she is ...\"\n\n\"Shouldn't you both be in class?\" she asked.\n\n\"I was excused.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" said the feminist.\n\n\"Well that's fine then. Talking about all that eh, ha, here have some strawberries.\"\n\n\"I was going to make a smoothie,\" she said.\n\n\"Good good,\" said her mother.\n\n\"It was a teacher's idea, a school paper, but not necessarily news.\"\n\n\"Interesting.\"\n\n\"I don't eat animals, and our friend, the authority at the cafeteria, stopped serving animals, so I'm defending the decision essentially.\"\n\n\"What about the witch hunts\" asked a student.\n\nMiss Dream was the teacher. Her expression was not tainted by any objections or restraints. She knew why she was there.\n\n\"They killed people for being healthy,\" she says. \"It's as horrible as the idea of an evil eye, someone giving you a look, which means nothing and could even have nothing to do with you.\"\n\n\"Give me more homework,\" a laughing student said.\n\n\"Should I memorize any of this?\" asked another.\n\n\"I don't think that'll be necessary,\" replied Dream.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Mr. White entered the classroom.\n\n\"Talking.\"\n\n\"We need more music, more writing, more theatre. It's all wrong. And don't grade them,\" he said.\n\n\"All homework is now optional,\" said Dream immediately.\n\n\"He's writing something over there in the corner, so that would be better,\" said the principal.\n\n\"It'll be a conversation then, like a good book. Let's discuss Nazi Germany.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked a student.\n\n\"So he just killed people?\" asked another?\n\n\"He killed and deceived,\" Someone else said.\n\n\"Hitler was fake,\" said Dream.\n\n\"I don't care about him. There's not enough trees.\"\n\nIn the main hall.\n\n\"Can I talk to you please?\" It was an education official. A woman in a dress.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the student.\n\n\"You have to be here ... follow me.\"\n\nShe led him around the corner to a small room without windows. There was a chair in the corner.\n\n\"Sit down. Do you know why you're here?\"\n\n\"I dunno.\"\n\n\"Did you have permission to miss class?\"\n\n\"I had to finish homework.\"\n\n\"Which homework?\"\n\n\"The class I missed.\"\n\n\"You skip all your classes. I have your record here. What if you miss something? What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I'm not sleeping enough.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Homework.\"\n\n\"You're the only one with that problem. Why is that? Don't you like the butts? You're the only one.\"\n\n\"I'm tired.\"\n\n\"Is that an opinion? Do you like honey? You want to be here, do you deny that? Have you had your body done?\"\n\n\"No ...\"\n\n\"What about your teeth?\"\n\n\"No ...\"\n\n\"Look at my hair ...\" It was orange.\n\n\"Why am I here. I'm just tired ...\"\n\n\"Do you like rainbows?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You're hiding something ... I can tell ...\"\n\n\"I just tried to get grades.\"\n\n\"Do you think you're funny? Don't you know why you're here? Do you know who I am? I'm testing you.\"\n\n\"To prepare for a job?\"\n\n\"What would you do without homework? We're fake here, do you have a problem with that? ... Have you considered poetry or drawing?\"\n\n\"I'm just tired.\"\n\n\"Are you being sarcastic?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about ...\"\n\n\"Look at my dress. You need to attend classes, all of them. There's too much advertising. That's all, you're free to go.\"\n\nShe did not tell anyone she was coming and she left without another word.\n\nThe park space by the school became a continuous festival. Everyone was eating and there was a play as they listened to a beautiful duduk.\n\n\"There are fish in that stream!\"\n\nSomeone was pitching some smooth pebbles.\n\n\"Wouldn't they know that I'm throwing them? Are you saying fish don't think?\"\n\n\"You're blocking the stream, what difference does that make?\"\n\n\"I'm not here all day ... they'd have to be thoughtless ...\"\n\n\"It's not respectful.\"\n\n\"Are the cars driving all around us disrespectful, with the exhaust and noise?\"\n\n\"What are you two arguing about? I'm a police officer. I'll decide who's wrong.\"\n\n\"Fish and cars ... not fish and chips.\"\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\n\"Are the cars on the roads like pebbles thrown into a fishy stream?\"\n\n\"What is a fish?\" The officer perked his eyebrows amusingly, and that was the end. The audience burst with laughter and a naked woman danced laughingly while sprinkling herbs along her merry way across a stage.\n\nThen the woman with the herbs was singing:\n\n\"A song from a bird comes freely just for you,\n\nA fruity party, not there, with the cloudy moon.\n\nMusic for all you see but nowhere to go,\n\nBlossom beautif'ly but wouldn't let it grow.\n\nA warm and nutty swirl.\n\nSo free, so like a squirrel.\n\nMy good soul lovely meets,\n\nTo eat the sunny sweets.\n\nA way for the moon,\n\nRainbow with a loon.\n\nWalls divide your mind,\n\nNow its lost to find.\"\n\nAn assembly with a very important visiting doctor:\n\n\"How do you all feel today? What a beautiful day! Wow, that sun shining, makes me want to go for a checkup. You can see my colleagues over there to check your head for lice. Allow me to remind you of the food pyramid. What you should be eating. Less salt. So important. Less sugar, less calories, less fat, less carbs, less food actually, that's a really good idea. Fibre. You're going to want all of that fibre, just get some cereal, and I recommend low-fat milk, or no milk. Awesome. Lots of veggies, and some meat. You know, it's so amazing that we're here, this was so unlikely, there was hardly any chance of it all happening this way, but it did. Wow, it's like Goldilocks! I don't even know why we're here. It was just so much dust and it all just came together, it's unbelievable. There are so many stars, it makes me feel so little ... I don't know why. And all we needed was electricity and some soup. ... I'm so sad about religion, I don't know what to do, but I do love wine ... and milk, ha ha, the milky way is interesting, ha ha ...\"\n\nA gypsy fiddler began playing very intricately and joyfully just outside the auditorium. The principal was there and said not to mind.\n\n\"He'll be doing that,\" he announced neutrally.\n\n\"Milk is murder!\" someone yelled suddenly.\n\n\"Stop killing babies!\" yelled someone else.\n\n\"Earth is flat!\", and then a woman laughed.\n\nThe doctor tried to regain their attention through the music, which was decent.\n\n\"Is the milky way murdering babies? Is that the position of this audience? Hahaha!\"\n\n\"Stop bombing people\", as if the doctor had any authority.\n\n\"Well, the universe is flat, like a pancake, of course,\" said the doctor, attempting desperately not to appear like the enemy he actually was.\n\nSomeone broke a window outside, with a rock. The principal left the auditorium to go check on it and, returning, not a word. The doctor continued:\n\n\"We're all so happy to be here, it's such a vibrant and excellent place and we all enjoy being here. The grading is so important, and we know that is the reason why we are here, and how beautiful is that? Marx made class seem like a bad thing. You need the highest grades possible, that's a law of nature just extended out of Darwin's philosophy. And some people are upset, so what? Our extraordinary beginning came out of nothing. This happened billions and billions of years ago, in the middle of nowhere, for no reason. Why? You need science to figure that out, and, yes, that is the new religion. You'll need to figure that one out for yourself.\" He chuckled. \"See, that's funny if you're scientifically literate. I'm still looking for the answer myself, along with millions upon millions of other people. I base my beliefs on the information and the process that we call science. It fills me with joy to know that we can pursue these answers. You and I are somehow at least one of the ways that the universe knows itself, you and I are a product of the universe, we are nothing and everything. It's astonishing. I see your faces, I know, yes, we have come to be because of the universe's existence, and we are driven to pursue that, to find out where we came from, and the second question I think we all want to know ... are we alone?\"\n\n\"The school system was wrong and we had to change. There's a community now and it grew from here. There was no community, there was no society. We changed that. We're talking to each other, and not to judge, not to memorize, not to grade, but to grow, discover what we would like to do, not to impose what is already done. We inquire into our sacred emotions, freely, to decide authentically what we would like to talk about or work on, and so everyone is interested and teachers are no longer cogs in a machine but active participants in society, not merely doing what someone else told them to do. You don't need to complete an endless rigmarole of assignments, so write a play, write poetically, write a song, a short story, paint, grow, seeds, words, and we'll keep it here and share together. The teachers have a conversation, about what you're thinking about, and that's the curriculum. You can merely guide, if you will, along with everything else.\" These were the words of the principal to one of the teachers.\n\nA man was visiting the principal to learn about who he was. The classes were dialogues, food was bountiful, even free, and there was a genuine community, music all the time, plays, the printing press was a golden rule and freedom of expression reigned it seemed like the whole land. He was interested in his soul. He had woken up one morning and realized he was somewhere else and was wondering how. There was only freedom when it came to the school or anything having to do with it, everywhere else was the old world.\n\n\"How did you do it?\"\n\n\"I chose freedom, every single time\" said the principal.\n\n\"I'd like to change classes please.\"\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"I really should.\"\n\n\"Why, you have all the best classes here.\"\n\n\"He wanted me to draw and colour a poster to summarize a textbook.\"\n\n\"You can drop out if you feel that way.\"\n\n\"Why not just change classes.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid that's impossible.\"\n\n\"Whatever.\"\n\n- Elias Ishak, Burnaby\n\nYou can find Elias Ishak on YouTube.\n\n\u270d\ufe0f Do you have a short story you'd like to share?

After a season of resignations and other difficulties involved in retaining officers, it appears that hiring is once again on an upward trend.\n\nThe Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) published the findings of a survey showing that the era of understaffed police agencies might be coming to an end.\n\nThis development comes after a sharp rise in resignations and relocations of police officers over recent years.\n\nMore sworn officers were hired in 2023 than in any one of the previous four years, and fewer officers overall resigned or retired, according to the 214 law enforcement agencies that responded to a survey by the Police Executive Research Forum, or PERF.\n\nFloyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers spurred nationwide protests against police brutality and heightened scrutiny of law enforcement.\n\nAs more and more officers left, many of the departments had to redeploy stretched resources by shifting officers away from investigative work or quality of life issues such as abandoned vehicles or noise violations to handle increases in crime and, in some cases, the shortages meant slower response times or limiting responses to emergencies only, police officials say.\n\n\"I just think that the past four years have been particularly challenging for American policing,\" said Chuck Wexler, executive director of PERF, a nonprofit policing think tank based in Washington, D.C. \"And our survey shows we're finally starting to turn a corner.\"\n\nThe report notes that first the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak, \"agencies reported a year-over-year increase in total sworn staffing\" and that \"retirements dropped back down to roughly where they were in 2019 after being elevated for the previous three years.\"\n\nThe staffing issue became so pronounced that \"small towns unable to fill jobs are eliminating their police departments and turning over police work to their county sheriff, a neighboring town or state police,\" according to a 2023 report.\n\nAt least 521 U.S. towns and cities with populations of 1,000 to 200,000 disbanded policing between 1972 and 2017, according to a peer-reviewed 2022 paper by Rice University Professor of Economics Richard T. Boylan.\n\nIn the past two years, at least 12 small towns have dissolved their departments.\n\nWhile the hiring shortages issue appears to be abating, there are still issues in smaller departments, according to Wexler, who also pointed out that these agencies make up 80 percent of police departments nationally.\n\nThe organization notes that many departments have addressed the staffing issue by revamping their hiring processes.\n\nWexler believes some of those changes make sense, including allowing visible tattoos, reweighing the importance of past financial issues and processing applicants' background checks faster. But he cautioned that PERF does not support lowering standards for training or for applicants.\n\nMaria \"Maki\" Haberfeld, chair of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says departments have been too focused on officer numbers. She worries some are lowering education requirements and other standards to bolster numbers instead of trying to find the best people to police their communities.\n\n\"Policing is a real profession that requires more skills and more education than people can understand,\" she said. \"It's not about tattoos or running a mile in 15 minutes. It's really more about emotional intelligence, maturity and making those split-second decisions that don't use deadly force.\"\n\nThis development comes as violent crime rates, while still considerably higher than five years ago, are on the decline. It is not yet clear whether the easing of the hiring shortage problem has had an impact on crime rates.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_charles@redstate.com", "name": "Jeff Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/113/295b23e3-a312-486d-b2d5-98ab277ade50.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9519709", "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 452044514, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a72"}

During her first year as an ASU graduate student, Wormley was awarded a National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship, which provided her extensive funding to focus on research and travel to various conferences.\n\nShe's the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including the Cialdini Speaker Research Fund in 2024; the Study on Stress, Spirituality, and Health Catalyst Fund from the International Consortium on Psychosocial Stress, Spirituality, and Health; the Department of Psychology's Daryn and Marie Linder Graduate Fellowship in Social Psychology in 2023; and both the Outstanding Research Excellence Award and the Teaching Excellence Award from ASU's Graduate Professional Student Association in 2022.\n\nWormley's research focuses on interplay of ecology, culture and religion. She is known for integrating elements of popular culture into her work and gained national recognition for launching a new ASU course about the psychology of Taylor Swift.\n\nIn June, Wormley will embark on a postdoctoral research position at the University of Michigan's Emotion & Self-Control Lab. There, she will study culture in social media and emotion research, aligning with her broader goal of securing a faculty position to further her research, teaching and community engagement.\n\nAnswer: From my freshman year of college, I wanted to go to Arizona State University. My two undergraduate mentors, Drs. Oliver Sng and Joshua Ackerman, did their PhDs at ASU. I figured, if I wanted to be like them, I should do my best to follow in their footsteps.\n\nFor what we study, we are one of the top programs in the world, and I was incredibly honored to get to study here among the greats. Additionally, we have fantastic training in quantitative methods and pedagogy. The view of the mountains and the food in Phoenix are a nice plus!\n\nQ: Can you share more about your doctoral dissertation?\n\nA: My dissertation looks at how ecology can explain cultural variation, and I am advised by professors Michael Varnum and Adam Cohen. In understanding why cultures differ from one another, one might consider their ecology: the social and physical features of the environment relevant to an organism's fitness. Multiple theories propose that cultures and the individuals within them respond to the threats and opportunities offered by the ecology in predictable and adaptive ways. This dissertation demonstrates how ecology can -- but does not always - -- explain a significant portion of cultural variation.\n\nThe three published, first-authored, peer-reviewed articles featured in this work leverage best practices in archival data to demonstrate the relationship between ecology and cultural variation. The key takeaways? Average levels of ecology explain around 20% of the variance in culture and pathogen threat does not explain the existence of food taboos.\n\nQ: We've got to talk about it -- the popular Taylor Swift course -- can you share more about your experience teaching the class?\n\nA: When I got into graduate school, I never thought teaching would be the highlight of it. Teaching PSY 101: Introduction to Psychology and PSY 350: Introduction to Social Psychology was fun, but there is nothing like the Taylor Swift class. You have a group of students who are really motivated to be there and have already studied the fundamentals of psychology. That combo has led to incredible conversations about why people develop parasocial relationships with celebrities, the neuroscience underlying love, how lyrical music can distract us from studying, and, of course, the latest Taylor Swift gossip.\n\nMy students have really taken charge of creating a supportive classroom environment where we can be our authentic Swiftie selves and ask deep questions about human nature. My name may not go down in history for my research, but hopefully it will for this awesome class -- and I'm truly proud of that.\n\nQ: What professor taught you the most important lesson while at ASU?\n\nA: We have great faculty in our social psychology area, and they have all taught me a lot. But the first lesson I had to learn at ASU wasn't about theory or methods. I TA'ed for Professor Virginia Kwan my first semester for her Personality Psychology class. Before I gave my first lecture -- ever -- I practiced with Dr. Kwan. Her initial feedback was to be more confident. This goes beyond presenting. We need to have confidence in our research. We need to have confidence in our teams. We need to have confidence in our accomplishments.\n\nQ: Could you elaborate on any specific experiential learning opportunities that significantly influenced your academic and personal growth?\n\nA: My best experiences have been the traveling I got to do with this program. I got to spend my summers as a visiting scholar at New York University in the Social Identity and Morality Lab. I also got to participate in a summer intensive program sponsored by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology at Ohio State this summer and travel to conferences in the U.S. and abroad each year. All this traveling allowed me to meet really cool people and learn new perspectives for doing science. It helped me narrow down my own research interests but also enabled me to receive feedback on my research from outside perspectives. I also got to experience the different cultures and ecologies I study!\n\nQ: Can you share a challenging moment during your academic journey and how you overcame it?\n\nA: The toughest part of graduate school was being away from my support system, especially starting during the pandemic. I spent my first year at ASU without my family or my partner and did not get to meet with my classmates or professors in person. Being alone in my house for a year was really tough, but it gave me the time and space to delve into my studies. Still, it is important to build a strong, sustainable support system. I set up regular times to call my friends and family back home and made a point to come into the office once campus reopened. It may seem obvious, but the literature tells us that social support is one of the best ways to boost our mental health.\n\nQ: What's the best piece of advice you'd give to those still in school?\n\nA: Always have a passion project that is just yours. As a student, you are going to have homework, applications, obligations and late nights, but you cannot lose sight of what you are doing all of it for. Even if you only get to work on it once a month, having something fun to think about and practice your newfound skills on reminds you what you are working for. Sometimes, it even turns into something!\n\nQ: What was your favorite space on campus, whether studying, meeting friends or just thinking about life?\n\nA: My favorite spot on campus is Charlie's Caf\u00e9 in Biodesign. Caffeine, and just a quick walk from the psychology building on ASU's Tempe campus.\n\nQ: If someone gave you $40 million to solve one problem on our planet, what would you tackle?\n\nA: This is so nerdy, but infrastructure. My research has me thinking a lot about how our environment shapes our values, beliefs, and behaviors. One aspect of our environment is infrastructure -- our roads, our waterways, our bridges, our airports, our schools, our public transit -- and America has some of the worst infrastructure.\n\nI have a theory that increasing access to public transportation, especially, would solve issues related to carbon pollution, employment and mental health -- to name a few. Forty million would not be able to fully address the issue, but if we could conduct an experiment to demonstrate the benefits of simple repairs to infrastructure I think we would see some remarkable outcomes.", "source": {"uri": "news.asu.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "ASU News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_fields@news.asu.edu", "name": "Laura Fields", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 452044469, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a73"}

Crushing squeezes, muddy passages, icy waterfalls. Bats and spiders. Abseiling over ledges into the unknown. How far would you go for a fossil?\n\nAuthor\n\nTim Ziegler\n\nCollection Manager, Vertebrate Palaeontology, Museums Victoria Research Institute\n\nOn a two-year retrieval mission of nearly 60 hours in an underground cave, we met our limits - and went beyond.\n\nThe limestone slope of Potholes Cave Reserve is found in Gunaikurnai Country, north of the township of Buchan in eastern Victoria.\n\nHere, the river valley is peppered with shadowy entrances to underground caves. Portals barely large enough to permit a willing caver open into kilometres of subterranean passages encrusted with delicate crystals twinkling in torchlight.\n\nIn one of them, Nightshade Cave, the Museums Victoria Research Institute led a team of recreational cavers and Parks Victoria rangers to excavate an extraordinary fossil: a near-complete skeleton of the extinct short-faced kangaroo Simosthenurus occidentalis. In June this year, it will appear on display at Melbourne Museum.\n\nIt started with an unusual skull\n\nAs is so often the case in palaeontology, the discovery began with engaged citizens out in nature. In 2011, a local caving group first entered Nightshade Cave through an opening previously blocked by soil. One of the group, Joshua Van Dyk, sighted an unusual animal skull.\n\nRecognising its potential significance, he reported the find to Melbourne Museum. However, Van Dyk reckoned it was irretrievable, appearing to be crushed under boulders in a narrow vertical collapse. The cave was gated shut to protect its contents, and a decade passed quietly.\n\nIn 2021, I took an interest in the intriguing find. Members of the Victorian Speleological Association were only too happy to assist a return to the cave.\n\nRigging a ropeline, we abseiled down a tight ten-metre rift, emptying our lungs to pass tight points in midair. We corkscrewed into a narrow passage and wormed, single-file, through low-domed chambers hung with dripping stalactites and plastered by popcorn-like calcite formations.\n\nDescending deeper, the cave transformed into tall, narrow, clean-walled rifts, full of dark recesses. Hours passed as we circuited the passages, until a shout echoed around: found again! We scrambled to a chimney-like chute stacked with pinned boulders, to come eye to eye with an ancient.\n\nOn reaching it, I felt sudden grief: the beautiful fossilised skull had in the intervening years begun to collapse. It seemed that, despite its long survival, the fossil was newly vulnerable - from little more than the altered air currents and changing humidity caused by the new cave entrance.\n\nWe strengthened the exposed bones with protective resins, but exited the cave having left them in place: more time would be needed to plan their retrieval.\n\nA painstaking retrieval\n\nOn our return trips, I carefully brushed away fine layers of mud and we photographed and packed the newly freed fossils. The skull had a deep muzzle, with robust jaws and teeth that marked it as a short-faced (sthenurine) kangaroo.\n\nBehind it were more bones. It was a marvel to see vertebrae, shoulders and hips, limbs and a narrow ribcage: many of the bones were wholly undisturbed and still in their original positions. This was a single animal, not a random scattering of bones. It felt like a fossil holy grail.\n\nA detailed comparison to fossils in the Museums Victoria State Collection gave our skeleton its identification as Simosthenurus occidentalis. Comprising 150 preserved bones, it is the most complete fossil skeleton found in a Victorian cave to date.\n\nThat it is a juvenile rather than adult kangaroo further distinguishes it from other examples of the species. Its teeth show little wear, its skull bones are still unfused, and its limb ends had not yet joined, suggesting it was still young at its time of death.\n\nFrom the size of its limbs, we estimate it weighed around 80 kilograms - as much as an average person - but might have grown half as large again had it reached adulthood.\n\nAustralia's extinct megafauna\n\nShort-faced kangaroos appear in Australia's fossil record from 10 to 15 million years ago, as widespread rainforests began to give way to drier habitats. They became particularly diverse during the shift toward our current arid climate in the later part of the Pleistocene Epoch, from around 500,000 years ago.\n\nBut in a pulse of extinction around 45,000 years ago, they vanished across the continent, along with up to 85% of Australia's megafauna. Radiocarbon dating by the Australian Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation dated the skeleton's burial to 49,400 years ago. This means our S. occidentalis was among the very last of its kind.\n\nToday, the hills of eastern Gippsland host a precious population of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby, a vulnerable species. Once, they shared the country with larger kin.\n\nA key idea under investigation is whether sthenurine kangaroos walked with a striding gait, rather than hopped. The skeleton we found has a uniquely complete vertebral column, providing new insights we couldn't get from isolated bones. With the benefit of detailed 3D models, this near-complete skeleton can also be studied from anywhere in the world.\n\nThis fossil, along with others from Nightshade Cave, is now housed and cared for in perpetuity at Melbourne Museum. Through Museums Victoria Research Institute, we can preserve a link to its once home of East Gippsland, while opening a door to global research.\n\nTim Ziegler received funding from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) for radiocarbon dating analysis. He is affiliated with the Victorian Speleological Association.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

Now, as she prepares to graduate this May with bachelor's degrees in psychology and biological sciences, along with a minor in mathematics and a certificate in computational life sciences, her impact at ASU is undeniable.\n\nNelson has been named the Department of Psychology's spring 2024 Dean's Medalist at The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.\n\nServing as the current president for Psi Chi at ASU and conducting research in multiple labs, the Barrett, The Honors College student took advantage of opportunities both inside and outside of the classroom.\n\n\"I was impressed by the number of resources available to students, including the hundreds of student organizations I could join. I knew that I would be able to explore all my academic and personal interests by coming to ASU,\" Nelson said.\n\nHer path, defined by her active participation in multiple schools and programs, stands as a testament to her guidance for fellow students: explore all your personal and academic interests. The numerous accolades she's received over the years showcase her versatility.\n\nShe's a two-time winner of both the Psychology Scholar Award in the Department of Psychology and the Student of the Year award in the School of Life Sciences, as well as the recipient of the School of Life Sciences' Outstanding Service Award. Nelson is also a SOLUR Fellow and was recognized with an undergraduate research scholarship. Most recently, she was honored with the Mensch Prize in biological sciences for her honors thesis project.\n\nWe caught up with Nelson to learn more about her studies, her extracurricular involvement and her plans for the future.\n\nQuestion: Can you describe a specific moment or experience that solidified your decision to pursue degrees in psychology and biological sciences?\n\nAnswer: When I started college, I had a general interest in the brain and behavior, but I was unsure if I wanted to explore these topics from a natural or social science perspective. During my first year, I joined the Cooperation Lab with Dr. Athena Aktipis, where my primary responsibilities included transcribing and promoting the science podcast, Zombified. It was here that I learned about the underrepresentation of women in both preclinical and clinical research on medications. This experience sparked my interest in exploring the physical and neural mechanisms underlying behavior, ultimately leading me to declare a double major in biological sciences (neurobiology, physiology and behavior) and psychology.\n\nQ: What were the results of your honors thesis sequence?\n\nA: I have been working on my honors thesis in the SOCIAL (Study of Circuits in Adolescent Life) Neurobiology Lab under Dr. Jessica Verpeut. My project investigated how sex and the cerebellum impact social behavior in mice. Atypical cerebellar development is commonly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. While autism is more commonly associated with males, it is important to understand cerebellar function in both sexes. I developed a novel behavioral test to assess the behavior of freely moving mice interacting with other social conspecifics and objects for this project.\n\nAll my behavioral data were analyzed using machine learning. I trained neural networks to track the position of each mouse, and I independently introduced the lab to a machine learning program that classified interactive behaviors between pairs of mice. I just defended my honors thesis this semester, and I am now working toward publishing it.\n\nQ: Could you elaborate on any specific experiential learning opportunities that significantly influenced your academic and personal growth during your time at ASU?\n\nAnAswer: I have served three years on the executive board of Psi Chi, the International Honor Society in Psychology, at ASU. I began as the director of research and conferences, where I independently planned the Arizona Psychology Undergraduate Research Conference (AZPURC).\n\nThis was my first experience organizing a large academic conference, and I was responsible for encouraging students to present their research, securing a keynote speaker and ensuring that room, food and poster stand rentals were all arranged. Currently, I hold the position of president of Psi Chi, where I helped coordinate a psychology and neuroscience teaching booth for the Department of Psychology at ASU Homecoming.\n\nQ: Which professor taught you the most important lesson?\n\nA: One of my favorite classes at ASU was PSY 366: Psychological Disorders, taught by Dr. Carolyn Cavanaugh Toft. I had a very limited understanding of mental disorders coming into this course. This changed not only by learning about the symptoms and treatments for each one but also through the stories Dr. Cavanaugh Toft shared about her time as a clinician. From this experience, I learned that you can gain so much from listening to another person's experiences, whether that is inside or outside the classroom.\n\nQ: What was your favorite space on campus, whether studying, meeting friends, or just thinking about life?\n\nA: After attending class or working in the lab, I enjoy going back to my dorm in the Barrett Residential Complex. It's a great place for me to quietly relax or do homework at my desk. If I am unable to do that, then I enjoy hanging out in the Psi Chi office on the second floor of the Department of Psychology.\n\nQ: Can you share more about your plans after graduation? How do you envision your future work contributing to the field of psychology?\n\nA: I will be pursuing a PhD in neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego. I am currently interested in continuing my research on social behavior, as well as exploring how early-life stress and environmental factors can broadly impact brain development, or the intersection between healthy aging and the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. All of these research interests tie into the classic psychology debate on how \"nature vs. nurture\" influences the development of an organism.\n\nQ: If someone gave you $40 million to solve one problem on our planet, what would you tackle?\n\nA: I wouldn't be where I am today without the dedication of my elementary, middle and high school teachers who ensured I received a solid education. Therefore, I would allocate this money towards supporting teachers so that more students can access a quality education, empowering them to achieve their personal and professional goals.", "source": {"uri": "news.asu.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "ASU News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_fields@news.asu.edu", "name": "Laura Fields", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 452044456, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a75"}

The Mekong Delta is witnessing a continuous digital transformation revolution in agriculture, unfolding every day and every hour.\n\nAmid the radiant sun and expansive rice fields nearing harvest season, farmer Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Khanh greeted us warmly, on his sun-darkened face a bright smile.\n\nAs he led us to see the rice fields, he pointed to the unmanned aerial vehicle flying above and said: \"I bought this T10 myself, then hired someone to operate it. The machine is spraying organic fertiliser to make the grains firm. Modern rice farming is different now, not like before, with many mechanical processes to take care of.\"\n\nKhanh, a prominent farmer in the \"land of pink lotus\" \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p, has gained recognition for his achievements growing Japanese rice varieties in Tam N\u00f4ng District. With a rice production area spanning 120 hectares, he is committed to adhering to the VietGAP standard. This involves reducing pesticide usage, producing high-quality and safe rice, and mitigating the environmental impact of fertilisers and chemicals. To achieve this goal, he utilises unmanned aerial vehicles and a range of other mechanical tools.\n\nKhanh said: \"Agricultural production according to VietGAP standards is different from traditional agriculture that uses a lot of fertiliser and chemicals. Cultivating three rice crops a year with that amount of fertiliser and chemicals will heavily pollute water sources and land. Applying VietGAP standards to the rice production process will reduce productivity, but with large-scale production, closed processes, and the use of modern technology in care, production costs will decrease, while product prices will be higher.\"\n\nRecognising the pivotal role of modern technology in rice cultivation, Khanh has invested in a range of advanced machinery, including unmanned aerial vehicles, electric pumps, ploughs, cultivators, combine harvesters, and excavators. Additionally, he employs smart sensor systems in the fields to monitor various factors such as water quality, pest presence and weather changes, enabling him to devise solutions proactively through his smartphone. With the aid of modern technology, Khanh efficiently manages his 120-hectare rice fields with just 30 workers.\n\nIn January 2024, Khanh expanded his commitment to sustainable agriculture by dedicating 32 hectares of his rice fields to the project \"Transforming the rice value chain in response to climate change and sustainable development in the Mekong Delta.\"\n\nThis initiative, backed by a A$17 million (US$10.8 million) investment from the Australian Government and executed by the Netherlands Development Organisation in collaboration with agricultural sectors in An Giang, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p and Ki\u00ean Giang provinces, aims to convert 200,000 hectares of rice to sustainable production in over six consecutive seasons from 2023 to 2028. This endeavour seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard the environment.\n\nAssessing the current landscape of rice production in Tam N\u00f4ng District, L\u00e2m Tr\u1ecdng Ngh\u0129a, deputy director of the Tam N\u00f4ng Agricultural Services Centre, notes that farmers face challenges in determining rice selling prices and reducing production costs. Despite potential limitations on productivity compared to traditional methods, cost reductions translate to increased profits. In regions like \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, where unpredictable weather disrupts the annual cycle, advanced technical solutions and modern technology enhance the resilience of rice plants to climate change, ensuring consistent productivity and quality.\n\nAccording to Tr\u1ea7n Thu H\u00e0, director of the project \"Transforming the rice value chain in response to climate change and sustainable development in the Mekong Delta\", the project has mobilised 11 reputable companies in the rice industry to collaborate with farmers and cooperatives in localities. These companies have brought excellent technology packages to ensure that farmers receive at least 30 per cent of the profits from rice production when implementing purchase contracts. The products can participate in the premium rice segment; and when carbon credits are sold, companies will also share profits with farmers.\n\n\"In the first phase, more than 8,000 hectares of rice have been registered to participate in the project. The activities will lay the foundation for companies and farmers to link themselves and share profits. The project has proposed a measurement reporting, and verification system for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (MRV), recognised by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which can be applied on a large scale. Carbon credits from the project are not only traded at the project or national level, but can also enter the international voluntary carbon market,\" H\u00e0 added.\n\nAccording to the implementation orientation of the project \"Sustainable development of one million hectares of low-emission, high-quality rice cultivation, linked to green growth in the Mekong Delta by 2030\", Tam N\u00f4ng District has registered about 4,900 hectares of rice to participate in the project by the end of 2023, 12,000 hectares in 2025, and over 29,000 hectares in 2030 - equivalent to the entire rice area of the district. The expansion of rice cultivation area to reduce emissions is being implemented more urgently than ever.\n\nNgh\u0129a from the Tam N\u00f4ng Agricultural Services Centre highlighted that farmers in Tam N\u00f4ng, already adept at modern cultivation techniques and climate change adaptation, stand to benefit greatly from specific guidance, which could bolster the local agricultural sector. As awareness grows regarding the significance of modern technology in rice production, there's a gradual shift towards organic farming and the adoption of scientific methods, potentially becoming a widespread movement in the region.\n\nThe local transformation\n\nAccording to Decision 749/Q\u0110-TTg approving the \"National Digital Transformation Programme by 2025, with a vision to 2030,\" agriculture emerges as one of the eight priority sectors for digital transformation. This initiative aims to enhance productivity, quality and resource efficiency while reducing costs and fostering innovation across the agricultural value chain. Digital transformation is seen as essential for modernising the agricultural industry, boosting productivity and improving competitiveness domestically and internationally.\n\nRecognising the imperative and benefits of digital transformation, various localities in the Mekong Delta have initiated measures to promote digitalisation in agriculture. For instance, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 City's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is developing databases, digital platforms and agricultural management software, alongside conducting training sessions to educate farmers, cooperatives and businesses on digital transformation. Similarly, Ki\u00ean Giang Province's agriculture department has established an electronic trading platform for agricultural products and developed applications to support production management, disease prevention, weather forecasting and market information dissemination.\n\nWith active involvement from authorities, departments and farmers, the digital transformation in Mekong Delta agriculture is making strides, boosting productivity, quality and competitiveness while fostering sustainable development and improving farmers' livelihoods. Nonetheless, challenges such as limited technology infrastructure, digital skills among farmers, and rural access to digital services persist. Hence, a comprehensive approach focusing on infrastructure improvement, human resource development and collaboration among sectors, localities and businesses is crucial to expedite the digital transformation process and ensure the region's sustainable agricultural development.\n\nIn An Giang, between 2017 and 2022, the province implemented 710 new production development models incorporating high technology into rural agriculture, focusing on crop cultivation, livestock farming and aquaculture. These models have led to the adoption of effective digital transformation practices by farmers, cooperatives, and businesses.\n\nLarge farms now employ closed barns with automated systems for feeding, watering and waste collection, all remotely controlled via smartphones or computers, resulting in faster livestock development, reduced disease incidence, shorter breeding times and increased efficiency. Swiftlet breeding operations also benefit from remote management and monitoring, utilising cameras and automated mist sprayers to regulate conditions and monitor flock health without disturbing the birds.\n\nMeanwhile, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province has launched the Digital Transformation Project for the agriculture sector from 2022 to 2025, with a vision extending to 2030. Spearheaded by the provincial Digital Transformation Committee, the project focuses on digitising management data and implementing automation across various agricultural sectors. Through platforms like VDAPES, management systems for crop cultivation, livestock, aquaculture and rural development are being digitised to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Many cooperatives have embraced unmanned aerial vehicles for pesticide spraying, machine-planting rice and deploying sensor systems for irrigation management and pest monitoring. GIS technology is also leveraged for database management, enhancing pest forecasting and control efforts.\n\nIn \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, six smart water monitoring stations and 15 smart insect monitoring stations have been installed to support models applying Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in data collection for cultivation warning, forecasting and origin traceability. All origin traceability management data is integrated and managed on the digital data platform of the province's agriculture.\n\nA change of perspective\n\nMinister of Agriculture and Rural Development L\u00ea Minh Hoan stresses that the agriculture sector in Mekong Delta provinces faces unprecedented challenges across economic, social, and environmental aspects. To foster sustainable and efficient agriculture, breakthrough technology solutions are imperative, along with a shift towards high-value production models to uplift farmers economically. Minister Hoan advocates transitioning from agricultural production thinking to agricultural economy, highlighting fragrant rice and clean shrimp as prominent models for the Mekong Delta region.\n\nHowever, according to V\u0169 S\u01a1n from the Institute of Economic Development Research at H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City University of Economics, the details of digital transformation remain unclear to farmers, businesses and localities. Limited infrastructure for digital data systems and inadequate training in digital transformation hinder effective utilisation of digital tools among farmers. S\u01a1n recommends prioritising high-quality human resource training to meet the growing demand for digital transformation in the Mekong Delta and emphasises simplifying the concept of digital transformation while enhancing connectivity among stakeholders.\n\nNguy\u1ec5n Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Lam, director of the VCCI's C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 branch, underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy for digital transformation in Mekong Delta agriculture, based on vision, institutional framework, science, technology and structural changes. Lam suggests shifting the vision to align with modern agricultural development trends, establishing an enabling institutional framework, and embracing science and technology advancements such as mechanisation, digitisation and smart production. This transformation aims to enhance the quality and value of agricultural products while integrating agricultural production with broader economic and social development activities. -- VNS", "source": {"uri": "vietnamnet.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietNamNet News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static-images.vnncdn.net/files/publish/2024/4/28/digital-transformation-is-the-new-buzz-on-rice-fields-1048.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9521383", "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 452044369, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a77"}

It robs us of mental strength and motivation, and is directly linked to depression.\n\nAmy Morin, keynote speaker at this week's MES Spring event in Orlando, has made a career out of studying the habits of mentally strong people, and drawing up a list of things they don't do.\n\nAn odd choice of speaker for an IT conference? Not at all. IT leaders are under increasing pressure, and looking after your mental health is essential to protect yourself, your employees and your job.\n\n#1: Embrace failure\n\nIT, perhaps more than any other career, knows the power of fast failure and learning from mistakes; but even so, sometimes we're afraid of failing.\n\nAs a species, humans love to hear about great things successful people have accomplished; but the more we focus on success, the more difficult it is to handle failure in our own lives.\n\nAmy quoted an experiment with science students at a US high school. They were learning about famous scientists who had accomplished incredible things, but the longer this went on, the more their grades suffered. The teachers changed tack and began talking about famous people's failures - Edison's failed inventions, Einstein's unsuccessful experiments - with an immediate positive effect on grades. The students learned not to be afraid of taking a risk.\n\nSo, instead, embrace failure. Assess risk, but don't be afraid of it. And if you do fail, don't beat yourself up - talk to yourself like you would a close friend who'd been through the same thing.\n\n\"If a friend called you up about a missed promotion, you wouldn't beat them up about it - you'd share kind words,\" said Amy. \"Don't be a harsh coach for yourself; self-compassion is the key to recovering from failure.\"\n\n#2: What can you control?\n\nWe often focus too much on things we can't control; that makes us anxious, and with more anxiety we try to control more things.\n\n\"It becomes a vicious cycle,\" said Amy, \"so try changing the channel in your brain.\"\n\nWhat does that mean? It means trying not to think about something almost guarantees it will keep popping up. Instead, physically do something different: call someone, clear your desk, or just get up and move to a different room. Do something you need to focus on, to get your brain onto a different topic.\n\n\"That's not to say the other thing isn't going to come back... But the point is, when you change the channel in your brain for a few minutes, you boost your mood. Then, when your brain goes back to thinking about it, you can have a different perspective, or decide to address it tomorrow.\"\n\nWhen people worry too much, they get so focused on things that could happen that they struggle to concentrate, to stay in the moment and get things done.\n\n#3: You can't please everyone (really)\n\nMany of us are guilty of putting too much effort into making sure everyone is happy (people outside IT might disagree with this statement). Being a people-pleaser can make it more difficult to reach your goals, because it drains the motivation you have for your own work.\n\nOrlando, the site of this year's MES Spring conference, is only a few hours from Amy's home in the Florida Keys. There, she said, was a great seafood restaurant with lots of variety, but a few years ago its business started to suffer. After some time, a consultant brought in to help realised the owner was \"obsessed\" with reading online reviews of his business and trying to address them - so the restaurant added a kids' menu, some Mexican food, etc.\n\n\"He had got so far away from what made the restaurant special that he wasn't pleasing anybody.\"\n\n#4: Celebrate success\n\nMentally strong people don't resent other people's success, said Amy. This is very bad for us, and we mostly know it, but that doesn't mean we don't do it!\n\nRemember that, in most cases, we're not in competition. Just because someone else has achieved what you were trying to do doesn't take away from your own efforts.\n\nInstead, learn from other people. Has someone else come up with a solution to that database problem you've been wrestling with? Ask them what it was. Has a peer's firm launched a new AI tool and you want a piece? Reach out and see if they're willing to talk.\n\n\"Look at other people as opinion holders, not competitors.\"\n\n#5: Change is good\n\nYou can't work in IT and be afraid of change - the two are practically mutually exclusive. Still, you might occasionally find yourself holding onto a bad situation or tool simply because it's predictable.\n\nOn the other hand, change isn't always good, just as negative emotions aren't always bad (anger can give us the courage to speak up, for example). Being able to tell the difference is a key quality in a leader.\n\n#6: Take calculated risks\n\n'Calculated' is the key word here. We're really bad at calculating risk - we think the level of fear is equal to the level of risk.\n\n\"If I were to tell you I've just called an Uber to take you 20 miles and then you're going to give a talk to 200 people, most of you will be much more fearful of the speech.\n\n\"I absolutely used to be one of those people, but then I came to the conclusion that the Uber ride is actually riskier. There's a social risk to getting up on stage, but probably not a physical one - I don't think any of you are going to rush the stage and beat me to death with your shoe. Just because something is scary, doesn't mean it's risky.\"\n\nIf you're afraid, 'act as if'. This isn't the same as 'fake it till you make it', which is often counterproductive and can make us feel like frauds. Acting confidently, though, absolutely can convince your brain that you are confident.\n\nWe are still very bad at caring for, or even being aware of, mental health in the UK. Some people will have clicked away from this story before the end of the third paragraph, convinced that it's a waste of time. But sooner or later, we all reach a point where we need all the mental strength we can muster.\n\nMES Spring is a flagship event for our North American sister brands, the MES IT Leadership Network and MES Computing.", "source": {"uri": "computing.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_allen@computing.co.uk", "name": "Tom Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/c1e23f6/a5e9e836-2a16-40a7-a98c-22a825b69522/1/MES-Spring-2024-Amy-Morin-370x229.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 452044246, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a7a"}

Concerned townspeople were soon calling her about the trapped animal.\n\n\"The first day, we were like: 'Oh, that's very bad, but we cannot attend, we are not experts',\" she recalls.\n\nAs the hours ticked by, the community's urge to act grew. \"By the second day, we said: 'Well, we have to do whatever we can'. And then [on] the third day, we went out [to] sea with just garden tools and our knowledge about whales.\"\n\nSo began seven dangerous hours of her and several other like-minded locals attempting to cut the animal free with equipment designed for trimming plants. Meanwhile, other whales were trying to intimidate them into leaving.\n\n\"It was quite dangerous. But the whale was fully released and we were all okay,\" says Frisch-Jord\u00e1n, who is also the head researcher for an NGO called Ecology and Conservation of Whales (Ecobac). \"It changed my life completely.\"\n\nThe event led to the formation of the Mexican Whale Disentanglement Network (Raben), which this year celebrates 20 years of operation and the successful disentanglement of 66 whales from gillnets, lobster pots and other fishing gear.\n\nFrom its early days in Banderas Bay, Raben has grown to encompass 15 teams and 180 members. Its growth has coincided with a surge in reports of tangled whales, from less than 10 a year, to 37 by 2021; Frisch-Jord\u00e1n co-authored a paper published in February that details this rise. According to experts consulted by Dialogue Earth, the surge parallels a global increase. This has likely been driven by an outreach effort encouraging people to report, an increase in entanglements as fishers expand their activities, and the recovery of North Pacific whale populations after the end of industrial hunting.\n\nFreeing the bound\n\nBeing tangled in a net or other fishing gear is a horrible experience for marine mammals. Held below the surface, smaller animals can drown, and while larger creatures may be able to swim away, injury is common. Ropes can cut into flesh and slow whales down or force their bodies into awkward positions that inhibit feeding.\n\nWhales are hugely powerful and can drag fishing gear that would be impossible for humans to even lift - one whale attended by a Raben team off Mexico's coast was tangled in a cod pot from Dutch Harbor in Alaska weighing over 200kg, Frisch-Jord\u00e1n's paper notes. The whale may have dragged the load for more than 4,000 nautical miles.\n\nFreeing whales from entanglements is not easy. Typically, teams approach in small boats and try to attach their own line to whatever fishing gear is entangling the animal. If this is successful, buoys are attached to the line, which slow the whale down and keep it at the surface, allowing crucial time to try and cut away the entangled gear with special knives.\n\nThe risk for would-be rescuers is becoming entangled in the very fishing gear they are trying to cut loose. Members of disentanglement teams have been dragged under the water and died in such cases; some rescuers have also died from the impact of marine animals hitting them.\n\n\"Training people to do this is an enormous responsibility,\" says Scott Landry, who directs the Marine Animal Entanglement Response programme at the Center for Coastal Studies in the US. \"We live in fear that people are going to be injured doing this work.\n\n\"These are large animals. These are fast-moving, messy operations, and we're dealing with an animal that has no idea we are trying to help them,\" adds Landry, who is also a member of the International Whaling Commission (IWC)'s Expert Advisory Panel on Entanglement Response. \"I would say they are very unpredictable - and you're getting them at the worst moment of their lives.\"\n\nThe techniques used by Landry, Frisch-Jord\u00e1n and others around the world have their roots in whaling, mankind's rather less friendly interaction with the world's largest mammals. Whalers would harpoon them and attach barrels to keep the animals from disappearing below the waves: this history has simultaneously led to today's dangerously low populations of some species, and provided disentanglers with the tools to help.\n\nThe right whale problem\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, North Atlantic right whales were savagely hunted. The whales' name comes from the notion that these animals - which can exceed 15 metres in length and 60 tonnes in weight - were the \"right\" ones to hunt, as they were slow-moving and would float once dead.\n\nThe pre-whaling population, estimated at 21,000, was harpooned down to a few hundred by the end of the 1800s.\n\nAfter growing steadily from less than 300 in the early 1990s to number nearly 500 at the start of the 2010s, the North Atlantic right whale population has now contracted to approximately 350. The chief cause is people: the whales are most commonly struck by ships plying the eastern seaboard of the US, or tangled in Atlantic fishing gear.\n\nResearchers who have studied scars on these animals believe over 80% of North Atlantic right whales have been entangled at least once.\n\n\"Any threat to a right whale that will increase its mortality risk, or increase ill health from sub-lethal entanglement, will directly affect the chances of the species going extinct,\" says Michael Moore, who directs the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Marine Mammal Center in the US.\n\nMoore cites estimates that around 70 reproducing females are left.\n\nRight whales with calves, like this pair photographed on 18 December 2021 off the coast of Florida, are an increasingly rare sight. Experts believe only around 70 female North Atlantic right whales are currently reproducing. (Image: Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, taken under NOAA research permit / Flickr, CC BY NC ND)\n\nBecoming trapped in fishing gear can so sicken whales that they are no longer able to reproduce. Some entangled right whales become so emaciated that they sink rather than float when dead; this is normally only seen in exhausted females after carrying young and giving birth. \"Essentially they are dead whales swimming,\" says Moore.\n\nTaking techniques around the world\n\nNorth Atlantic right whales are not the only marine mammals on the brink.\n\nDavid Mattila, who coordinates the IWC's expert panel and the Global Whale Entanglement Response Network, is also concerned about the impacts of entanglement on Arabian Sea humpback whales, Chilean right whales and Sea of Okhotsk bowhead whales. Entanglement might also harm the western grey whale, but the animal is so rare Mattila cannot be sure it still exists.\n\n\"These are populations of large whales that are very critically endangered, and they are exposed to entanglement,\" Mattila tells Dialogue Earth. He adds that these are populations for which the death of even one whale due to entanglement could potentially be a major conservation issue.\n\nMattila was involved in the development of professional disentanglement efforts when they began in the 1980s. This year, he celebrates the 40th anniversary of his first rescue - a female humpback trapped in a gill net near Provincetown.\n\n\"Now we know, basically, it happens anywhere in the world you have whales and man-made rope or net in the water,\" says Mattila.\n\nGrowing concerns and rising reports of entanglements triggered the IWC to convene a special meeting on the topic in 2010, which recommended capacity-building for rescues around the world, alongside prevention. Mattila estimates that, to date, around 1,300 people from 36 countries have been trained by this IWC initiative.\n\nRope: A problem for fishers, and for humanity\n\nFor every whale reported to a rescue network, many more are entangled and die unseen. The real solution, say those involved, should be preventing whales from encountering rope in the first place.\n\nModern fishing gear ropes are made of various forms of plastic, and manufacturing changes in the 1990s significantly increased their strength. Using weaker rope - either by cutting some strands or manufacturing weaker rope in the first place - has been suggested as a way of saving whales, as has closing areas where whales might come into contact with boats, such as shipping lanes and fishing areas.\n\nSome fishers are also experimenting with marine-mammal-friendly, rope-free systems. For example, typical lobster fishing entails a lobster pot on the sea floor, permanently connected by a rope to a marker buoy at the surface. Rope-free systems use sunk gear with no permanent rope: instead, a lobster catch triggers the pot to release a float, which rises to the surface and signals the gear is ready for retrieval.\n\nHowever, these solutions all stand to increase the price paid by consumers. To date, society has not been willing to stomach that price, says Moore.\n\nCurrent industrial fishing methods are predominantly designed to prioritize the catch.

Contact him at: art@andidrew.com.\n\nThe United Nations established Jan. 27 as Holocaust Remembrance Day to mark the day in 1945 when Auschwitz was liberated. The German Nazis built Auschwitz and thousands of other concentration and death camps to imprison and kill more than 6 million Jews. Humanity pledged \"Never Again.\" Never again would people be killed for their race or religion. Never again would humanity let this happen.\n\nInstead of a relaxing winter break this year, 13 students from Drexel University in Philadelphia and I went to bear witness to the horrors of the Holocaust. We traveled with a group of Jewish students from various universities to see the death camps firsthand. It felt like we were in another world, but actually, this happened on Earth -- our Earth. These atrocities were committed by people -- regular people, just 80 years ago.\n\nWe saw the ghettos where Jews were forced to live and starve as rats. We touched the very cattle cars that shipped Jews off to the various camps. We visited concentration and death camps; chills went down our spines as we stepped through gas chambers and crematoria. We mourned at a mass grave of Jewish children in a forest. We saw unimaginable things and unspeakable things. We felt such raw emotions and cried countless tears.\n\nSomething powerful hit me in one of the gas chambers: This did not happen to \"them.\" It was not \"the Jews.\" It happened to me and my people; I am Jewish. These were my great-uncles, aunts, cousins -- my family. We were dehumanized and gassed, just for being Jewish.\n\nWorst of all, I find myself asking, how is this happening to my people again?\n\nHow can the then-presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University, in addition to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, openly say that calling for the genocide of Jews is not necessarily a violation of student conduct and that it depends on the \"context.\" How can calling for genocide ever be acceptable?\n\nAntisemitism is at record-breaking levels on campuses and cities around the world. The very week my group returned from Poland, a student praised Hitler on a Drexel whiteboard. And it's not just words: My friends and I have been harassed and even attacked for showing our Judaism on campus. Why do we have to hide our kippahs (Jewish head coverings) to feel safe?\n\nJust weeks after the terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, a Penn student said she was \"empowered and happy\" because of the massacre.

It dominated the box office and small-screen for decades, though it has waned somewhat in recent years. Nevertheless, movies and TV shows continue to borrow story elements and visual techniques from this timeless genre. Tales of outlaws and lawmen fighting for dominance are everywhere, from horror and drama to sci-fi and comedy.\n\nWatching Westerns is all well and good, but sometimes a viewer wants something a little different. Fortunately, a number of TV shows out there embrace the Western spirit or some of its stylistic trappings without quite being full-on Westerns. These shows relocate and adapt Western plots and characters to fresh settings or combine them with other genres, producing singular episodes that feel like they could happen in the Old American West, even if they're set miles away.\n\n10 'Deputy' (2020)\n\nStarring: Stephen Dorff, Yara Martinez, Brian Van Holt, Bex Taylor-Klaus\n\nClose\n\n\"You're the hero no one saw coming. Except me.\" Stephen Dorff leads this Fox series as Deputy Bill Hollister, a fifth-generation lawman with a cowboy ethos and a no-nonsense approach to justice. When the sheriff unexpectedly dies, Bill finds himself thrust into the job, tasked with leading a department in turmoil while navigating the complex political landscape of L.A. County.\n\nLike a gunslinger from a classic Western, Bill is uncomfortable with bureaucracy and frequently takes matters into his own hands. He bends the rules, but only to protect the citizens he serves. For example, Bill frequently flouts protocol by heading to the front lines, taking part in raids, and putting himself in the thick of danger. He even leads his comrades on several horseback assaults. Dorff is solid in the role, helping to keep all the drama and action grounded. Deputy may not break any new ground, but it's a decent police procedural that should appeal to fans of the genre.\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\n9 'Outer Range' (2022-Present)\n\nStarring: Josh Brolin, Imogen Poots, Lili Taylor, Tom Pelphrey\n\n\"We're born to hunt, and one frontier begets another.\" This sci-fi centers on the Abbott family, who run a struggling ranch nestled in the Wyoming mountains. After the arrival of a drifter called Autumn (Imogen Poots), patriarch Royal Abbott (Josh Brolin) discovers a black void in one of his fields. He tries to understand its mysteries while a rival family attempts to take control of his land. Murder and time-warping shenanigans soon follow.\n\nOuter Range is a moody thriller, drawing from a wide range of inspirations and making them meld together surprisingly well. It's a mix of Lost and Yellowstone, with a dash of The X-Files and a hint of The Twilight Zone. The family drama aspects are handled especially well, and Brolin is terrific in his part. The end product is an intricate and weird Western for the modern day, with a twisty plot and some mind-bending concepts from speculative science.\n\nOuter Range Sci-FiWestern Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRelease Date April 15, 2022 Creator Brian Watkins Cast Josh Brolin , Lili Taylor , Tamara Podemski Seasons 2\n\n8 'Vegas' (2012)\n\nStarring: Dennis Quaid, Michael Chiklis, Carrie-Anne Moss, Sarah Jones\n\n\"Next time you come after my family, it won't be settled in a sheriff's station.\" Vegas is a 1960s period show created by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote Goodfellas and Casino. Inspired by true events, it stars Dennis Quiad as Sheriff Ralph Lamb, a rugged rancher turned lawman sent to Sin City to maintain order. Police and criminals clash on the neon-lit streets as the Chicago mob attempts to spread its influence.\n\nVegas is a quintessential Western story (it even begins with the discovery of a body in the desert), but transplanted to the unusual setting of Swinging Sixties Las Vegas. James Mangold, director of 3:10 to Yuma and Logan, executive produced it and directed the pilot, and his visual influence is clear to see. Vegas had potential but was unfortunately canceled after one season, depriving audiences of what could have been a riveting neo-Western.\n\nVegas Drama Release Date September 25, 2012 Cast Dennis Quaid , Michael Chiklis , Carrie-Anne Moss , Jason O'Mara , Taylor Handley , Sarah Jones Seasons 1\n\n7 'Longmire' (2012-2017)\n\nStarring: Robert Taylor, Katee Sackhoff, Lou Diamond Phillips, Bailey Chase\n\n\"If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.\" Based on the novels by Craig Johnson, this crime drama centers on Sheriff Walt Longmire (Robert Taylor), a stoic officer who grapples with personal tragedy while upholding the law in a county rife with crime and corruption. Assisted by his deputies, including the resourceful Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti (Katee Sackhoff) and the steadfast \"Ferg\" (Adam Bartley), he navigates a myriad of cases ranging from murder and kidnapping to drug trafficking and tribal disputes.\n\nOne of Longmire's strengths is its picturesque setting in Absaroka County, Wyoming, including mountains, plains, and endless sky. Each season tends to have a central case, with subplots and digressions that intertwine with it. Longmire's stories are confidently told, and the mysteries are engaging, even if the series never quite reaches the point of being truly great. A highlight is the way the show slowly reveals the truth about what happened to Walt's wife years earlier.\n\nLongmire TV-14 CrimeMysteryWestern Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRelease Date June 3, 2012 Creator Hunt Baldwin, John Coveny Cast Robert Taylor , Lou Diamond Phillips , Cassidy Freeman , Katee Sackhoff Seasons 6\n\n6 'Preacher' (2016-2019)\n\nStarring: Dominic Cooper, Joseph Gilgun, Ruth Negga, Lucy Griffiths\n\n\"I am NEVER going to be your Messiah.\" Preacher is AMC's adaptation of the cult comic, starring Dominic Cooper as Jesse Custer, a disillusioned small-town preacher imbued with a mysterious power born from the unholy union of an angel and a demon. With the ability to command anyone to do his bidding, Jesse sets out on a quest to find God, who has abandoned heaven. He intends to hold the Creator accountable for the state of the world.\n\nPreacher is rapidly paced and bursting with violence, demonstrating executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's commitment to the source material. It's a gleefully demented story involving vampires, outlaws, long-dead historical figures, and the literal Devil. Custer's journey across the American heartland plays out like an acid Western crossed with the Book of Revelation but shot through with maniacal humor.

The tale of Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), his fall from grace and chance for redemption, draws from comedies and courtroom dramas but still has that Western feeling of frontier justice and the tensions between criminality and the law.\n\nLikewise, the show looks at the battle of maintaining order amidst chaos and the collision of ordinary lives with the criminal underworld. Saul himself is a kind of outlaw, using words rather than guns to slip around the dictates of the law and get his slimy clients off the hook. Not to mention, the authorities, represented by figures like Howard (Patrick Fabian) and Chuck (Michael McKean), can be just as twisted as the criminals.\n\nBetter Call Saul TV-MA DramaCrime Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRelease Date February 8, 2015 Cast Bob Odenkirk , Jonathan Banks , Rhea Seehorn , Patrick Fabian , Michael Mando , Tony Dalton , Giancarlo Esposito Seasons 6 Studio AMC\n\n4 'Justified' (2010-2015)\n\nStarring: Timothy Olyphant, Nick Searcy, Jacob Pitts, Walton Goggins\n\n\"I shot people I like more for less.\" Justified is a cop show based on stories by Elmore Leonard. Timothy Olyphant plays Raylan Givens, a U.S. Marshal with a penchant for old-fashioned justice. Reassigned to his hometown of Harlan County, Raylan must confront ghosts from his past, including his estranged father (Raymond J. Barry) and childhood friend turned criminal Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins), as well as the town's more violent elements.\n\nJustified is all about tense shootouts, damaged characters, and sharp dialogue. In fact, it might be the best translation of Leonard's famously punchy dialogue since Get Shorty and Jackie Brown. The highlight is Goggins as Boyd, a man who has seen deep darkness and still has his sights set on power, making the character intense but still believable. Olyphant and Goggins are classic Western figures in Justified, and their roles earned them considerable praise, including Emmy and Critics' Choice nominations.\n\nJustified TV-MA ActionCrimeDrama Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRelease Date March 16, 2010 Cast Timothy Olyphant , Walton Goggins , Joelle Carter , Jacob Pitts , Erica N.

His bulk, formidable combat skills, and unwavering sense of right and wrong make him a force to be reckoned with. When a shocking crime rocks the small town of Margrave, Georgia, Reacher investigates, only to find himself drawn into a web of conspiracy and corruption.\n\nAs one would expect, Reacher sticks close to the formulas that made the books so successful. This approach means that it's seldom surprising but almost always fun, whether Reacher is being framed for a murder he didn't commit or reassembling his old team for one last mission. Audiences seem to be responding, and ratings have been high.

With Jon Favreau at the wheel and Pedro Pascal behind the mask, this story about an enigmatic bounty hunter hit the ground running, quickly becoming one of the most streamed TV shows ever.\n\nIn typical Western fashion, the Mandalorian's solitary existence is upended when he's tasked with retrieving a valuable asset. He's gruff and detached, but his mission forces him to tap into long-buried emotions. The stylistic trappings of Westerns are there, too. The job takes Mando across deserts and into saloons, where he takes part in gunfights with all manner of varmints and cretins. The Mandalorian strikes a fine balance between impressive effects, hard-hitting action, deep dives into the lore, Baby Yoda's cuteness, and well-timed humor. It's jam-packed with beloved throwbacks as well as original fan favorites, making it a new classic in the storied franchise.\n\nThe Mandalorian TV-14 Sci-FiActionAdventure Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRelease Date November 12, 2019 Cast Pedro Pascal , Carl Weathers , Giancarlo Esposito , Misty Rosas , Temuera Morrison , Omid Abtahi Seasons 3\n\n1 'Breaking Bad' (2008-2013)\n\nStarring: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris\n\n\"Stay out of my territory.\" Breaking Bad is a Western to the core. The action unfolds in the deserts near the Mexico border, where cops and robbers battle it out in a world dominated by power, not morality. Moreover, Walt's (Bryan Cranston) transformation from chemistry teacher to drug kingpin mirrors the corruption of many a Western hero turned villain.\n\nVince Gilligan consciously looked to Westerns for inspiration when making the show. He pays homage to the work of John Ford and Sergio Leone, in particular. \"If you want to know where I'm coming from and where my sensibilities lie, you should watch The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\" Gilligan said. Fortunately, he had actors talented enough to rise to the task of his ambition. The result is a modern masterpiece that continues to exert a massive influence on TV.

The content included: \"Obey orders in all your actions; do not take a single needle or piece of thread from the masses; turn in everything captured.\"\n\nThis discipline made the Red Army popular with the people, and was in contrast to the Chiang Kai-shek-led KMT soldiers, who tended to be rude to villagers. The villagers voluntarily gave supplies and shelter to the Red Army and even joined them, greatly helping the CPC's war efforts.\n\n\"The people's support is our top political priority,\" Xi, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has stressed on many occasions. He has made explicit requirements many times for the Party to carry forward the glorious tradition of building discipline.\n\n\"We must not allow our discipline to become a dusty document resting on the top shelf,\" Xi has said.\n\nAddressing the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in January, he said the key task of advancing the Party's self-reform is to improve Party conduct, enforce Party discipline, and fight corruption.\n\nUnderscoring the need to improve the legal system used to fight corruption, he called for an education campaign on discipline within the Party.\n\nMaintaining unity\n\nYang Weidong, a law professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, said the ability to integrate a large-scale party with more than 5 million grassroots organizations and 98 million members, and unify their goals and actions, relies on a strict set of rules.\n\n\"This is a unique aspect that distinguishes the CPC from other political parties,\" he said. \"Otherwise, such a large party might be like a pile of loose sand,\" he said, adding that discipline is also needed to lead the people to achieve great goals.\n\nCompared with the two-party system in many Western countries, where the government might change every few years after one party loses an election, the CPC must win support from the people by placing strict constraints on its members, which is a higher requirement to consolidate the foundations for governance.\n\nChheang Vannarith, former president of the Asian Vision Institute, a think tank based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, said the mission of a political party is to build a vision for everyone so that the country can be united and work together.\n\nChina is unique as the CPC is the largest and most complex political party in the world. Discipline is very important as without discipline unity cannot be maintained, he said.\n\nConsidering the complex external environment as well as foreign interference, it's necessary to build a unified core through discipline education, which will prepare China for the decades ahead, Chheang Vannarith said.\n\nDemocracy and respect for the rule of law are declining in different parts of the world because of weak political systems, he said.\n\nA strong political party can contribute to nation building, especially in a country pursuing development, he said.\n\n\"But, unfortunately, not many political parties in the world have strong unity and a strong vision, so perhaps the CPC is the strongest of them all,\" Chheang Vannarith said.\n\nWang, the Party history expert, said the CPC is uniting and leading the people toward the goal of fully building a modern socialist country. This places higher demands on its governance capability and leadership.\n\nAt the same time, some Party members and cadres are not attentive, or have not grasped Party regulations and discipline. In many cases of Party members violating the law, a large number of them began by violating Party regulations and discipline first, he said.\n\nIn December last year, the Party's Central Committee released revised regulations on disciplinary action. It was the third time that the CPC made revisions to its regulations since its 18th National Congress in 2012. Adding 16 new items and modifying 76 items, it refines the supervision and disciplinary procedures, and punishment rules.\n\nYang, the law expert, said few political parties in the world are as rigorously organized as the CPC, with a strict set of rules and strict enforcement.\n\nPunishment includes severe warnings and expulsion from the Party, which could mean the end of member's political life and affect their career.\n\nIn July, Hu Jiyong, who previously served as Party secretary at one of the subsidiary companies of China National Petroleum Corporation, was expelled from the Party and removed from his positions for disciplinary violations.\n\nOn June 7, a video clip showing him strolling along a street in Chengdu, Sichuan province, holding hands with a young woman wearing a long, pink off-the-shoulder dress went viral.\n\nHu was soon placed under investigation by the disciplinary department of his company, which found he had an improper relationship with the woman during his marriage, and changed the schedule of his business trip to take the opportunity for recreation.\n\n\"Party discipline is more stringent than national laws,\" Yang said. If a member indulges in extravagant and wasteful spending, which causes a negative impact, they can face disciplinary punishment.\n\nThis strictness aims to make Party members and cadres hold themselves to higher standards than the public, he said.\n\nFighting corruption\n\nSergey Suverov, an associate professor at the Financial University under the Government of Russian Federation, said like any other country, corruption is a big drag on China's economic growth. It is very important, therefore, that Chinese authorities have consistently and decisively fought this evil, he said.\n\n\"We have observed that the CPC is conducting a ruthless fight against corruption, which is deeply respected. It will increase the pace and quality of economic growth and increase confidence in officials,\" he said.\n\nJames Gomez, regional director at the Asia Centre think tank, said anti-corruption measures are important, and any efforts to eradicate corruption by and within the CPC will be welcomed both locally and internationally.\n\nOleg Timofeev, an associate professor at Russian RUDN University, said over the past decade the CPC has made great achievements in its crackdown on corruption. The fight against graft has become one of the core elements of China's political system.\n\nHe said the activities and results achieved by the National Commission of Supervision, China's highest-level anticorruption body, are being researched all over the world.\n\nIn March, Timofeev was invited to the Great Hall of the People in Beijing to participate in the Second Plenary Session of the 14th National People's Congress of China when the president of the Supreme People's Court, Zhang Jun, delivered a plenary report. \"I witnessed the real enthusiasm of usually restrained Chinese legislators and a burst of applause every time the chief justice's report tackled the fight against corruption,\" he said.\n\nHe added he was sure the newly launched CPC discipline education campaign would double the government's efforts in the war against corruption, and accelerate the development of law-based governance structures needed for the nation's social and economic prosperity.\n\nTough challenge\n\nSourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-American Studies, said corruption is a \"tax \"on law-abiding citizen.\n\nIn developing countries, where incomes are modest, corruption is a key factor in deepening inequalities.\n\nReining in corruption is an arduous challenge, which is why disciplinary inspection and supervision need high-level support, as is the case currently in China, he added.\n\nKy Sereyvath, director-general of the Institute of China Studies at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, said since Xi took over as president, China has tackled corruption and also reduced unnecessary government expenditure.\n\nThe government has used funds more efficiently, especially in the construction of highways, roads, and other infrastructure, and also provides some funds for projects in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nIn recent years, China has helped strengthen global anti-corruption governance. In October, China announced that it would hold anti-corruption workshops for BRI partner countries, and train more than 300 graft fighters in Asia, Africa and Latin America within five years.\n\nChheang Vannarith said it's critical for countries to keep fighting corruption and building a strong government as geopolitical competition is also a competition between different governance models.\n\nThe question of which government remains strong and resilient is what will be important in the future, he added.\n\nChheang Vannarith said China is at the next phase of fighting corruption through disciplinary measures. This will be strongly emphasized by the CPC in the next 4 to 5 years, as it is the right time to strengthen the Party and good governance.\n\nChina will see intensive domestic reforms with anti-corruption at the top of the agenda, he said. If the reforms can be achieved, China will be a much more resilient nation.\n\n\"When you have a resilient nation, even when there's a storm outside China can stand firmly on its own feet,\" he said.\n\nYifan Xu in Washington, May Zhou in Houston, Yang Wanli in Bangkok contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202404/29/662edc39a31082fc2b6d0343.jpeg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.803921568627451, "wgt": 452043195, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a87"}

By\n\nAFP-Relaxnews Published\n\nApr 29, 2024\n\nDonning hijabs and floor-length abaya gowns over shorts and tank tops, Chinese students at an e-commerce school perform into a smartphone camera as they learn how to sell the clothes to overseas TikTok users.\n\nIt is the final day of a two-week course on selling products abroad via the short video app -- which despite being blocked in China is a platform more and more Chinese vendors are turning to.\n\nSucceeding on TikTok requires tools for bypassing internet restrictions as well as foreign-language skills, challenges that have prompted a boom in courses and consulting services.\n\nAt the school in Guangzhou in southern Guangdong province, an instructor holds up the Middle Eastern-inspired garments to the camera and rattles off prices and sizing information for Muslim buyers in the UK.\n\n\"This is chiffon, it's really breathable!\" she gushes in English as her proteges model the goods and sort through racks of satin robes under stark studio lights.\n\n\"We teach people which products are selling better, and which markets are more suitable for their current stages,\" 27-year-old Wang Yaxuan, another instructor at the school, tells AFP.\n\nGuangdong is home to thousands of factories making a mindboggling variety of products, from the abayas to espresso machine parts to wigs made of human hair.\n\nAfter decades of producing goods for export, Chinese companies are increasingly seeking to cut out the middleman and market themselves at lower prices, directly to overseas consumers.\n\nShein, the China-founded fast fashion giant, has effectively taken over the lower-end Western market using this strategy, with TikTok a key facet of its selling network.\n\nTikTok Shop launched in the United States late last year, and e-commerce features have previously been rolled out in places like Britain and Southeast Asia.\n\nA casual scroll on the hugely popular app's \"Live\" tab can land users on multiple shopping livestreams within minutes.\n\nBut with TikTok unavailable in China -- parent company Bytedance operates the more strictly censored sister app Douyin domestically -- smaller businesses there are at a disadvantage.\n\nCourses like the one at Mede Education Technology's e-commerce school help by covering everything from the basics of creating a TikTok account to handling shipping and analysing sales data.\n\nFees start at around 9,000 yuan ($1,244) for a six-day course.\n\nStudents, who range from factory owners to fresh graduates, often take classes for multiple foreign shopping platforms including Amazon and Southeast Asia's Shopee.\n\nInformation gap\n\nQiu Zhouwen, a course participant in his 30s, works for a Guangzhou cosmetics company.\n\nHe says his company enrolled him because they are hoping to eventually sell their skincare range through TikTok.\n\n\"Information is part of the cost (of doing business) now, and if you don't have the information that's appropriate to the market, your cost will be way too high,\" Qiu says.\n\nWang, the Mede instructor, attended university in the United States and says it can be challenging for Chinese sellers to adapt to different consumer tastes abroad.\n\nChemical manufacturer Donghua Jinlong spawned viral memes on TikTok this month after overseas social media users found absurdist humour in the company's matter-of-fact

It was in a Royal Navy launch that was transported to the US and converted into a pleasure boat, before eventually being tied up to a wharf and left to rot.\n\nTwo main engines - it has four in total - were both sourced from overseas and the final piece of the jigsaw needed to get everything finished was the boiler.\n\nNow it's on site project manager Peter Tustian said the next step is building a steel platform to put the boiler on, then connect her up to the four engines and get her working.\n\nThe boiler will run on compressed wood pellets, which Tustian said is more environmentally friendly than petrol or diesel and is an efficient way to power her up.\n\n''It's a modern boiler using the latest technology with a total output of 800 kilowatts of power. We can't just bolt her to the hull though and have to build a strong foundation to spread the boiler load evenly.''\n\nHe said after almost 15 years to get to this stage was fantastic and he was looking forward to the next steps, and hoped the Minerva would be ready to steam along the water for the 2025/26 summer season.\n\nTustian said the Kerikeri Steam Trust and the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway Trust- which runs the steam train Gabriel and other trains from Kawakawa - will now become one and combine to provide a unique steam experience that would bring in tourists.\n\nHe said there probably won't be any where else in New Zealand that you can get a steam train, then depart to get on board a steam ferry.\n\n''This will see people get on the steam train at Kawakawa then steam to \u014cpua, get aboard the ferry Minerva then steam off to Waitangi or Russell. We think that will be an amazing steam experience,'' Tustian said.\n\n''And for the visitors it will be a very unique experience. We have open hatches and a window where people can see the steam engines working - the pistons turning and the works - so they will be able to see, hear and feel a steam experience that will be second to none.''\n\nThe Minerva was fitted with twin steam engines and propellers because it was designed to operate in the shallow Wairoa River near Clevedon. That also increased its manoeuvrability, which would be a boon on the Kawakawa River.\n\nThe restoration of the Minerva is part of a wider project involving the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway and the Twin Coast Cycle Trail and part-funded by the Provincial Growth Fund.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_dinsdale@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "Mike Dinsdale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/Y4LDFX7MB5CLXLXCWUE7EJOJDE.JPG?auth=16d647d6b7718cf1535666d8dae04cf6b147105e5491285b6820f9c27c394e95&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452044704, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a8b"}

While it's relieving that there were no casualties reported, the impact on livelihoods and infrastructure cannot be ignored. This incident, coupled with a similar occurrence last year, emphasises the urgent necessity for proactive measures to mitigate such disasters and enhance resilience within communities. Beyond immediate relief efforts, there is a pressing need to delve into the root causes of these disasters. The sinking of land in the Ramban district points towards underlying geological vulnerabilities that demand a thorough investigation.\n\nThis incident in Ramban district is not an isolated occurrence within the region, as similar incidents have been reported in other districts as well. Despite expert evaluations, the root cause remains elusive, leading to recurring incidents year after year. Speculations abound, with some attributing the sinking of land to the blasting of mountains for roads and tunnels, while others point to the proliferation of hydroelectric projects causing water seepage into the mountains and subsequent land sinking. To dispel these speculations and address the pressing concerns of affected communities, a comprehensive study must be undertaken. It is paramount to ascertain the true cause behind these incidents, as families continue to lose their homes with alarming frequency.\n\nAdditionally, the significant damage to power infrastructure underscores the need for a thorough inspection and audit of the region. Local authorities must heed any observations regarding potential risks in the area, as no reported incident can be taken lightly anymore. Timely action is crucial to prevent the loss of life and mitigate further material damages. Temporary solutions are insufficient, as the underlying cause of such extensive land sinking must be identified. In light of ongoing construction projects, such as tunnels, road widening, and railway development, it is important to safeguard these projects against potential hazards. While the current focus rightly remains on providing relief to affected families, subsequent efforts must prioritise uncovering the fault line responsible for these incidents. Development should never come at the expense of lives or the well-being of local populations. The mystery surrounding these occurrences must be resolved promptly. The Geological Survey of India and various engineering institutes must be mobilised to provide comprehensive reports, shedding light on the underlying causes. Only through a concerted effort to understand and address these issues can we ensure the safety and prosperity of communities in the region.\n\nFurthermore, while addressing the immediate needs of the affected population is paramount, long-term planning is equally crucial. A comprehensive disaster management framework must be devised, encompassing early warning systems, land-use planning, and infrastructure resilience measures. This entails incorporating risk assessment into development plans, ensuring that construction adheres to safety standards, and establishing contingency measures for emergencies. Local volunteers played a pivotal role in assisting affected families, showcasing the strength of solidarity in times of adversity. This underscores the importance of community-based disaster preparedness initiatives where residents are trained to respond effectively to emergencies and contribute to relief efforts. Additionally, leveraging technology, such as GIS mapping and satellite imagery, can aid in assessing damages and prioritising interventions. The integration of data-driven approaches into decision-making processes can enhance the effectiveness of disaster management strategies.\n\nAddressing the socio-economic dimensions of vulnerability is integral to building resilience. Many of the affected families in the Ramban district are now displaced and require sustained support for rehabilitation. Beyond immediate relief provisions, there must be efforts to restore livelihoods, provide psychosocial support, and strengthen social safety nets. This necessitates collaboration between Government agencies, NGOs, and civil society organisations to address the multifaceted needs of the affected population. Looking ahead, the Ramban incident serves as a wake-up call for policymakers and stakeholders to re-evaluate the stakes in the region.", "source": {"uri": "dailyexcelsior.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daily_excelsior@dailyexcelsior.com", "name": "Daily Excelsior", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://cdndailyexcelsior.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Page3-6-11.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9515944", "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 452044704, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a8c"}

This speculation comes at a time when Turks suspect U.S. involvement in the coup and when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has accused the West of supporting the coup. It also coincides with exhortations by commentators for the West to rethink, reassess or cut ties with Ankara. Such accusations and rhetoric call the future of Turkish-Western relations into question.\n\nWithin the field of international relations, realists assume that conflicts and alliances between states are determined and shaped by material measures of power, including geostrategic location, geographic depth, population size, economic vigor and military technology. Liberals, on the other hand, believe that inter-state relations are influenced by value-based or normative considerations, such as the extent that governments are democratic or authoritarian, and respect and uphold international institutions, laws, norms and values.\n\nAmid recent tensions before and after the failed coup, Turkish-Western relations have become strained over the liberals' value-based concerns. However, these relations will likely remain intact for the foreseeable future due to the realists' material factors in the geopolitical, military and economic realms.\n\nSince the failed coup attempt, Turkey and the West have squabbled over normative issues. The Turkish government has demanded that the United States extradite the Turkish cleric, Fethullah G\u00fclen, who has been living on his Pennsylvania estate in self-imposed exile since 1999. While secular officers may have led the coup, Ankara insists that G\u00fclen stand trial for allegedly staging and orchestrating a coup that threatened to illegally and unconstitutionally overthrow a democratically elected government. In the process, the Turkish government has been unable to understand why the democratic West would deny such a request.\n\nBefore agreeing to extradite G\u00fclen, the United States has demanded that Ankara comply with the principles of due process and the rule of law by submitting concrete evidence that corroborates his guilt or complicity in the coup. In the meantime, the United States and EU have condemned the post-coup purges and alleged torture that have taken place against thousands of suspected G\u00fclen sympathizers and followers in the government, bureaucracy, military, police, judiciary, media and academia -- the so-called parallel state. The EU has also censured the temporary suspension of the European Convention on Human Rights by the Turkish government so it could declare a three-month state of emergency and potentially impose the death penalty against suspected coup plotters and participants.\n\nPrior to the coup, Turkish-Western tensions had already surfaced and intensified over Ankara's authoritarian tendencies, including its repression of the Gezi Park protests and Erdo\u011fan's implicit designs to amend the constitution, change the political system to a presidential one, and concentrate executive powers into his hands. These designs are predicated on the AKP's ability to secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority in future elections. Western nations and international organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have intensely scrutinized and maintained high expectations and standards for Turkey -- a country that exceptionally established one of the Middle East's first pluralist, parliamentary democracies in 1950, joined NATO and the Baghdad Pact or CENTO in the 1950s and has sought EU accession since 1987.\n\nWhile value-based issues have tested and strained Turkish-Western relations, the probability of their demise is mitigated by material factors in the geopolitical, military, and economic domains. Geopolitically and militarily, the normative tensions that emerged between Turkey and the West have prompted commentators to propose expelling Turkey from NATO. This proposal had previously been raised after Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet and refrained from combatting ISIS in Syria. Following the failed coup, Ankara will have to convince NATO that it can restore military order and remain a reliable partner in multilateral operations. Nevertheless, Turkey's expulsion from NATO would damage the latter's reputation and integrity.\n\nTurkey's expulsion from NATO would also push Turkey toward one of its largest trading partners, Russia -- even if tensions between both countries over the fate and future of Syria will persist. Turkish-Russian rapprochement -- which had already been occurring before the coup -- would defeat the original purpose of NATO and the Baghdad Pact/CENTO of using Turkey as a buffer state against Soviet or Russian intervention in the Middle East. Expulsion from NATO would eliminate the benefits and privileges that Turkey receives as the Middle East's only member nation including hardware, equipment, technology, training, expertise, professionalization, coordination, intelligence, security and prestige.\n\nHistorical considerations aside, Turkey and the West currently and mutually benefit from their NATO alliance. To alleviate socioeconomic pressures and security concerns, the EU has increasingly counted on Turkey and signed a controversial and tenuous agreement with it to stem the flow of millions of Syrian refugees, especially with mounting terrorist attacks on European soil. The United States and the EU depend on access to Turkish airspace to conduct airstrikes and other operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. After the coup, Turkey temporarily closed the Incirlik military base and suspended operations there to likely get its military house in order, but also to send a message to the West regarding the repercussions of supporting the coup, condemning the government's response or refusing to meet its demands.\n\nDespite Turkey's dubious relationship with ISIS as a counterweight against the Kurds, Ankara recognizes the importance of maintaining and intensifying the fight against it after recent suicide attacks on the Istanbul airport and other local targets. After failing to become a model of Islamist democracy in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring and antagonizing regional allies with interventionist policies, Turkey cannot afford further isolation by distancing itself from its traditional allies in NATO. Ankara's real and perceived vulnerability after the coup renders cooperation and rapprochement with these allies an imperative.\n\nEconomically, the stakes of straining and rupturing Turkish-Western relations are equally high. Alongside Iraq, Iran, the UAE, Russia, China and South Korea, the EU and United States represent Turkey's top trading partners. Since entering into a customs union with Ankara in 1995, the EU has become Turkey's largest import-export market for machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods and chemical products. The relationship is bidirectional in that Turkey respectively comprises the seventh and fifth largest market for European imports and exports in similar sectors with steady flows of FDI on both sides. Even if Turkey's suspension of the European Convention on Human Rights sets back the EU accession process -- which had already been called into question given its lengthy duration and the affirmative vote on Brexit -- economic integration has already materialized and become a reality.\n\nWhile less prominent than the EU, the United States still represents an important trading partner. Bilateral trade between the United States and Turkey has increased significantly since Erdo\u011fan first came to power in 2003. Between 2010 and 2013, U.S. exports to Turkey more than doubled and included oil, iron, steel, aircraft, machinery, yarn, fabric and agriculture. In 2013, the United States began FTA negotiations with Turkey, and in 2015, accounted for $6.4 billion or 4.5 percents of its total exports, including vehicles, machinery, iron, steel, stone, plaster, cement and agriculture. Behind Germany, the United States constituted the largest market for Turkish exports in 2016.\n\nAs with the EU and Turkey, the United States and Turkey benefit from bidirectional FDI, even if the U.S. sum is approximately ten times greater. Without possessing the oil and natural gas reserves of its neighbors, Turkey relies on outside investment to bolster manufacturing and services. To maintain or boost its credit rating after recent terrorist attacks and the failed coup, Ankara will have to delicately balance the competing priorities of reestablishing stability and security with preserving transparency and the rule of law.\n\nTo protect or safeguard its legitimacy and longevity, the Turkish government will likely continue to demand G\u00fclen's extradition and subject suspected traitors and opponents to draconian measures -- which ultimately may further destabilize Turkey and the wider region. Particularly in an election year, the United States and its European allies will condemn these measures and contemplate punitive responses. Yet, given the United States and EU's authoritarian allies and unsavory bedfellows in the Middle East, such condemnations and threats will carry little credibility. In the end, contentious statements surrounding value-based issues will cause the Turkish-Western relationship to bend. Yet, material factors related to geopolitics, militaries and economics -- combined with the institutional momentum and inertia of historical alliances -- will prevent it from breaking.\n\nIf Egypt is any indicator, the West's relationship with Turkey will persevere. After Egypt's successful military coup in 2013 and the widespread repression that has followed, the United States and EU momentarily withheld or considered withholding military aid and financial assistance, but returned to business as usual given Camp David's enduring legacy and Cairo's geostrategic value. During this period of dramatic turmoil in the Middle East with a preponderance of failing states and formidable nonstate actors, the West will likely continue to favor stability over democracy -- even if a deficit in the latter polarizes, antagonizes and radicalizes the region's citizens.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/turkey_4.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452044560, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a8e"}

You might be familiar with the style because of your dad's workout gear back in the day, aka, when the sneakers were primarily meant for exercise. But now, as \"ugly sneakers\" continue to dominate the market, we're seeing more and more people wearing them out, including famous faces like Kaia Gerber, Hailey Bieber, and Jennifer Garner.\n\nI, for one, couldn't be more pleased by this collective shift toward comfort-first footwear. Hitting 10,000 steps is a big part of my personality, and I could never survive life in New York in a pair of uncomfortable heels. While Taylor Swift might romanticize the 1830s, I'm perfectly content with the decade I was born into -- an era where the same shoes you find at your local running store are also the ones street-style icons wear.\n\nBut here's the thing about Asics sneakers: They're first and foremost functional sports shoes worn by top-tier athletes. They offer styles for a variety of sports, including trail running, pickleball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and even wrestling. But, they don't stop on the courts -- or the field. They're the perfect day-to-night shoe that you can seamlessly transition from sports practice to school to evenings out, all thanks to their versatility.\n\nGorpcore enthusiasts are especially fond of various Asics styles, as most are designed with functional details and muted colors that feel trail and street-style ready. Not to mention, plenty of the options are constructed with comfort in mind, with many sneakers having special gel technology built-in that offers improved shock absorption and ample foot support. All this to say, Asics sneakers are the sneakers you can actually walk miles in -- and you won't want to kick them off at the end of the day.\n\nAsics wearers on the internet agree the shoes are, in fact, superior, with reviews calling them everything from \"gold standard\" of sneakers to the \"best shoes ever.\" Don't let the price scare you away either. One shopper noted, \"I was skeptical of the price until I had them in hand and on foot. Between the super premium materials and A1 comfort, I highly recommend them.\"\n\nAnother thing to note about Asics is that many sneaker models are gender-neutral. The inherently simple design and muted colors that many styles are designed in ensures wearability across the board; plus, you can style them however you please, too. You can wear them with a tennis skirt like Gerber, or take them to the street with baggy sneakers and a cropped white tee like Garner. Either way, you'll look cool, and you'll be comfortable, too.\n\nAscis are certainly blowing up -- and more celebs are bound to step out in the comfy kicks that might just prove to be a fierce Adidas Sambas competitor.

This jumped to 59,573 in 2023 and the force has already issued 24,887 fines this year.\n\nAt the heart of the problem, said experts and police officers, is a blatant disregard of the law, of public safety norms and the near-absence of the fear of prosecution.\n\nThe Delhi traffic police said most such cases have been reported from Gokulpuri, Shahdara, Khajuri, Dwarka, Vasant Kunj, Kalyanpuri, Kamla Market, Paharganj, Preet Vihar and Badarpur, adding that apart from these areas, e-rickshaws near most Metro stations also drive down the wrong side.\n\nAnd when not fatal, traffic is a major civic nuisance.\n\nTake Kashmere Gate, for instance - one of the busiest stretches in the city, with an interconnected metro station and a bus terminus that is victim to constant traffic congestion, largely due to e-rickshaws and auto-rickshaws snaking down the wrong side.\n\nSeveral commuters are desperate to take shortcuts and it doesn't matter if the roads are broad, or narrow, or arterial stretches, said a traffic police officer who asked not to be named.\n\n\"A traffic police officer cannot be present at all places and people obviously take advantage of it. Officials on duty try their best to prosecute, but violators often flee,\" said the officer, adding that such violators not only endanger their own lives but lives of pedestrians and others driving on the right side of the road.\n\nStretching far and wide\n\nUma Devi (43), a resident of Subhash Nagar in west Delhi fractured her right leg in May last year when she was hit by a scooter that rammed into her while driving down the wrong end of the street.\n\n\"Walking on these roads is scary... you are obviously not expecting people to travel down the wrong side and hit you. The only solution is stricter enforcement and heavy fines,\" she said.\n\nSection 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act pertains to dangerous driving, including wrong-side driving and provides for a \u20b95,000 fine for the first offence and \u20b910,000 for a repeat offence. Police can also impound the vehicle if they deem fit.\n\nIndeed, Delhi traffic police data shows that \"dangerous driving\" (a provision that includes driving against the direction of traffic) flow was the second-most common traffic rule violated, after helmet-less riding.\n\nDelhi's special commissioner of police (traffic) HGS Dhaliwal said wrong-way driving is one of the most common triggers for traffic jams and accidents, despite several interventions.\n\n\"To tackle this menace, the Delhi traffic police have taken several measures like increasing their presence on the roads to penalise wrong-side drivers, including imposing penalties on violators. We have also launched several campaigns about the dangers of wrong-side driving and the penalty it can attract,\" he said.\n\nThe officer said that they have also installed barricades at important points as well as prominent signages indicating \"No Entry\" or \"One Way\" to deter drivers from entering roads from the wrong side.\n\nHe also said the traffic police has partnered with other stakeholders to identify areas prone to wrong-side driving and implemented targeted measures to combat this issue.\n\nThe possible solutions\n\nAddressing the menace requires a multifaceted approach that combines robust enforcement measures with long-term infrastructure improvements and public awareness campaigns, said experts.\n\n\"Wrong-side driving is a cultural issue. When someone sees a shortcut that saves time, they take it, even if it's against the law, without thinking of the consequences. This is a traffic problem that cannot just be resolved by design changes. It needs strict and consistent enforcement at various levels,\" said S Velmurugan, chief scientist and head of traffic engineering and safety division of Central Road Research Institute (CRRI).\n\nIn addition to punitive measures, he suggested investing in technology-driven solutions to enhance traffic management and enforcement capabilities. Automated surveillance systems, including CCTV cameras and traffic monitoring sensors, should be deployed to identify and deter wrong side driving, he added.\n\n\"It need not be a major expenditure. There are already surveillance cameras at multiple locations in Delhi. At about 150 places, there are also cameras that are used for traffic penalties. There are off-the-shelf IT solutions available that the enforcement agencies can use to increase penalties. Additionally, the Lok Adalats that usually waive off many of the traffic challans, should not give any relief in case of offences such as wrong side driving,\" said Velmurugan.\n\nExperts add that efforts should also be made to improve road infrastructure and signage, by installing barricades, bollards or lane dividers to physically deter motorists from driving against the designated traffic flow.\n\n\"Violation of any traffic rule constitutes human error or driver's fault. However, from the perspective of road safety strategy, violations such as over speeding and driving on the wrong side do not constitute human error alone but it may be due to lack of education and enforcement. Moreover, the possible fault in road design may also be the reason of traffic rule violation, which opens the scope for road engineering measures to address problems which are prima facie, considered to be human error,\" said MoRTH's road accident report.\n\nAccording to Velmurugan, some of the limited design interventions that can be made in Delhi to reduce driving on the wrong side, includes junction improvement at the major junctions by reducing their size and making them compact.\n\nOther experts suggest adopting a \"Safe Systems Approach\" while designing roads and streets. This principle recognizes that humans will make mistakes, but crashes should not result in death or serious injuries.\n\n\"The Safe Systems Approach hinges on the principle of shared responsibility. Safety is not the responsibility of those using the infrastructure alone but also of those involved in the design and engineering, policymakers, and law enforcement officials. By adopting this approach, countries like Sweden have reduced road crashes by 55% in two decades. It is also estimated that one million deaths could be avoided annually if countries adopt this approach,\" said Pawan Mulukutla, Executive Program Director - Integrated Transport, Clean Air and Hydrogen at WRI India.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/28/1600x900/Several-commuters-are-desperate-to-take-shortcuts-_1714327894233.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9523415", "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 452044474, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a90"}

Crushing squeezes, muddy passages, icy waterfalls. Bats and spiders. Abseiling over ledges into the unknown. How far would you go for a fossil?\n\nAuthor\n\nTim Ziegler\n\nCollection Manager, Vertebrate Palaeontology, Museums Victoria Research Institute\n\nOn a two-year retrieval mission of nearly 60 hours in an underground cave, we met our limits - and went beyond.\n\nThe limestone slope of Potholes Cave Reserve is found in Gunaikurnai Country, north of the township of Buchan in eastern Victoria.\n\nHere, the river valley is peppered with shadowy entrances to underground caves. Portals barely large enough to permit a willing caver open into kilometres of subterranean passages encrusted with delicate crystals twinkling in torchlight.\n\nIn one of them, Nightshade Cave, the Museums Victoria Research Institute led a team of recreational cavers and Parks Victoria rangers to excavate an extraordinary fossil: a near-complete skeleton of the extinct short-faced kangaroo Simosthenurus occidentalis. In June this year, it will appear on display at Melbourne Museum.\n\nIt started with an unusual skull\n\nAs is so often the case in palaeontology, the discovery began with engaged citizens out in nature. In 2011, a local caving group first entered Nightshade Cave through an opening previously blocked by soil. One of the group, Joshua Van Dyk, sighted an unusual animal skull.\n\nRecognising its potential significance, he reported the find to Melbourne Museum. However, Van Dyk reckoned it was irretrievable, appearing to be crushed under boulders in a narrow vertical collapse. The cave was gated shut to protect its contents, and a decade passed quietly.\n\nIn 2021, I took an interest in the intriguing find. Members of the Victorian Speleological Association were only too happy to assist a return to the cave.\n\nRigging a ropeline, we abseiled down a tight ten-metre rift, emptying our lungs to pass tight points in midair. We corkscrewed into a narrow passage and wormed, single-file, through low-domed chambers hung with dripping stalactites and plastered by popcorn-like calcite formations.\n\nDescending deeper, the cave transformed into tall, narrow, clean-walled rifts, full of dark recesses. Hours passed as we circuited the passages, until a shout echoed around: found again! We scrambled to a chimney-like chute stacked with pinned boulders, to come eye to eye with an ancient.\n\nOn reaching it, I felt sudden grief: the beautiful fossilised skull had in the intervening years begun to collapse. It seemed that, despite its long survival, the fossil was newly vulnerable - from little more than the altered air currents and changing humidity caused by the new cave entrance.\n\nWe strengthened the exposed bones with protective resins, but exited the cave having left them in place: more time would be needed to plan their retrieval.\n\nA painstaking retrieval\n\nOn our return trips, I carefully brushed away fine layers of mud and we photographed and packed the newly freed fossils. The skull had a deep muzzle, with robust jaws and teeth that marked it as a short-faced (sthenurine) kangaroo.\n\nBehind it were more bones. It was a marvel to see vertebrae, shoulders and hips, limbs and a narrow ribcage: many of the bones were wholly undisturbed and still in their original positions. This was a single animal, not a random scattering of bones. It felt like a fossil holy grail.\n\nA detailed comparison to fossils in the Museums Victoria State Collection gave our skeleton its identification as Simosthenurus occidentalis. Comprising 150 preserved bones, it is the most complete fossil skeleton found in a Victorian cave to date.\n\nThat it is a juvenile rather than adult kangaroo further distinguishes it from other examples of the species. Its teeth show little wear, its skull bones are still unfused, and its limb ends had not yet joined, suggesting it was still young at its time of death.\n\nFrom the size of its limbs, we estimate it weighed around 80 kilograms - as much as an average person - but might have grown half as large again had it reached adulthood.\n\nAustralia's extinct megafauna\n\nShort-faced kangaroos appear in Australia's fossil record from 10 to 15 million years ago, as widespread rainforests began to give way to drier habitats. They became particularly diverse during the shift toward our current arid climate in the later part of the Pleistocene Epoch, from around 500,000 years ago.\n\nBut in a pulse of extinction around 45,000 years ago, they vanished across the continent, along with up to 85% of Australia's megafauna. Radiocarbon dating by the Australian Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation dated the skeleton's burial to 49,400 years ago. This means our S. occidentalis was among the very last of its kind.\n\nToday, the hills of eastern Gippsland host a precious population of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby, a vulnerable species. Once, they shared the country with larger kin.\n\nA key idea under investigation is whether sthenurine kangaroos walked with a striding gait, rather than hopped. The skeleton we found has a uniquely complete vertebral column, providing new insights we couldn't get from isolated bones. With the benefit of detailed 3D models, this near-complete skeleton can also be studied from anywhere in the world.\n\nThis fossil, along with others from Nightshade Cave, is now housed and cared for in perpetuity at Melbourne Museum. Through Museums Victoria Research Institute, we can preserve a link to its once home of East Gippsland, while opening a door to global research.\n\nTim Ziegler received funding from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) for radiocarbon dating analysis.

It just landed a $25 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to expand its methane leak simulator site in Fort Collins.\n\nThe Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center (METEC) is part of a collaboration between Colorado State University and the oil and gas industry to provide an advanced testing facility for new types of methane detecting equipment.\n\nThe simulator is \"eight acres of Hollywood well pads,\" said Daniel Zimmerle, director of the methane emissions program at CSU. \"I like to call it Hollywood well pads because it looks like well pads, we can make them emit like well pads. So, it is just like a Hollywood set except it's for leak detection.\"\n\nWhile CSU has been working on methane since 2011, the eight-acre facility outside of Fort Collins started in 2017 and operates more than 200 days per year testing equipment needed to find leaks in natural gas extraction and transmission systems.\n\n\"There is a tremendous need in the industry right now for support in method development and data collection to improve performance. This award from the DOE speaks to that need as well as our mission as a center directly,\" Zimmerle said in a news release. \"The planned upgrades will further enable testing across the natural gas supply chain from production to end use.\"\n\nZimmerle said there are more than 200 independently controlled leak points in the simulator that can be combined to set up scenarios typical of production systems.\n\nHis team of 18 full-time employees and about 16 graduate students both operate the simulator, sometimes 24/7 and for months at a time, and conduct field research.\n\nOne current field project involves flying aircraft equipped with methane detectors in all of the gas production basins in Colorado, including the Denver-Julesburg Basin north of Denver and the upper Green River basin in southwest Wyoming. The intent is to reconcile differences in leak data found in current measurements.\n\n\"That is what's called a top-down bottom-up project where we have towers that are going to surround the whole basin and get an estimate from the top down,\" said Zimmerle. \"And then we have a field campaign which is going to look at facilities with ground-based teams and aircraft-based teams to understand better why those two numbers don't agree.\"\n\nThe facility tests everything from fixed fence line monitoring sensors to hand-held and vehicle mounted system.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nIn the course of testing, said Zimmerle, methane is necessarily emitted into the atmosphere. He said they can program leaks as small as one cubic foot per hour up to 600 cubic feet per hour.\n\nUsing their portable system they can hook up to a gas line at a gas company's facility and go up to about 125,000 cubic feet per hour.\n\n\"That's a major event,\" said Zimmerle. \"And some of those may be like blow downs or similar types of maintenance events. Others could be things like an unlit flare in locations where gas flaring is allowed. You also see problems occasionally, rarely, but occasionally problems where there's actually leaks that large as well.\"\n\nOne of the technologies they work with is the frequency comb laser system invented and developed at the University of Colorado Boulder. That system, marketed by LongPath Technologies of Boulder, can not only detect methane emissions, but using laser light only absorbed by methane molecules, it can quantify how much of the gas is leaking.\n\n\"There's various hand carried instruments we've tested, things you can put on aircraft or drones and fly around stuff you put in larger aircraft and fly overhead,\" Zimmerle said. \"We've tested almost every combination except for one, actually we have not had gas sniffing dogs yet come to the facility and yes, it actually is a thing.\"\n\nZimmerle said they are developing a portable system that can be moved around the country to replicate equipment tests in different climatic conditions and on different site types.\n\nThe current site is going to be rebuilt to look more like today's larger, more complex natural gas handling sites.\n\nTo run a test of a detector costs about $3,500 per day, he said. But for larger test programs using multiple types of equipment, the costs can be split among participants. Also, Zimmerle said the Department of Energy has been buying down the testing costs by about a third to a half to make it less expensive and to stimulate the industry.\n\nTwenty million of the award comes from the DOE, while the remaining $5 million comes from matching industry funds.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The Mekong Delta is witnessing a continuous digital transformation revolution in agriculture, unfolding every day and every hour.\n\nAmid the radiant sun and expansive rice fields nearing harvest season, farmer Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Khanh greeted us warmly, on his sun-darkened face a bright smile.\n\nAs he led us to see the rice fields, he pointed to the unmanned aerial vehicle flying above and said: \"I bought this T10 myself, then hired someone to operate it. The machine is spraying organic fertiliser to make the grains firm. Modern rice farming is different now, not like before, with many mechanical processes to take care of.\"\n\nKhanh, a prominent farmer in the \"land of pink lotus\" \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p, has gained recognition for his achievements growing Japanese rice varieties in Tam N\u00f4ng District. With a rice production area spanning 120 hectares, he is committed to adhering to the VietGAP standard. This involves reducing pesticide usage, producing high-quality and safe rice, and mitigating the environmental impact of fertilisers and chemicals. To achieve this goal, he utilises unmanned aerial vehicles and a range of other mechanical tools.\n\nKhanh said: \"Agricultural production according to VietGAP standards is different from traditional agriculture that uses a lot of fertiliser and chemicals. Cultivating three rice crops a year with that amount of fertiliser and chemicals will heavily pollute water sources and land. Applying VietGAP standards to the rice production process will reduce productivity, but with large-scale production, closed processes, and the use of modern technology in care, production costs will decrease, while product prices will be higher.\"\n\nRecognising the pivotal role of modern technology in rice cultivation, Khanh has invested in a range of advanced machinery, including unmanned aerial vehicles, electric pumps, ploughs, cultivators, combine harvesters, and excavators. Additionally, he employs smart sensor systems in the fields to monitor various factors such as water quality, pest presence and weather changes, enabling him to devise solutions proactively through his smartphone. With the aid of modern technology, Khanh efficiently manages his 120-hectare rice fields with just 30 workers.\n\nIn January 2024, Khanh expanded his commitment to sustainable agriculture by dedicating 32 hectares of his rice fields to the project \"Transforming the rice value chain in response to climate change and sustainable development in the Mekong Delta.\"\n\nThis initiative, backed by a A$17 million (US$10.8 million) investment from the Australian Government and executed by the Netherlands Development Organisation in collaboration with agricultural sectors in An Giang, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p and Ki\u00ean Giang provinces, aims to convert 200,000 hectares of rice to sustainable production in over six consecutive seasons from 2023 to 2028. This endeavour seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard the environment.\n\nAssessing the current landscape of rice production in Tam N\u00f4ng District, L\u00e2m Tr\u1ecdng Ngh\u0129a, deputy director of the Tam N\u00f4ng Agricultural Services Centre, notes that farmers face challenges in determining rice selling prices and reducing production costs. Despite potential limitations on productivity compared to traditional methods, cost reductions translate to increased profits. In regions like \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, where unpredictable weather disrupts the annual cycle, advanced technical solutions and modern technology enhance the resilience of rice plants to climate change, ensuring consistent productivity and quality.\n\nAccording to Tr\u1ea7n Thu H\u00e0, director of the project \"Transforming the rice value chain in response to climate change and sustainable development in the Mekong Delta\", the project has mobilised 11 reputable companies in the rice industry to collaborate with farmers and cooperatives in localities. These companies have brought excellent technology packages to ensure that farmers receive at least 30 per cent of the profits from rice production when implementing purchase contracts. The products can participate in the premium rice segment; and when carbon credits are sold, companies will also share profits with farmers.\n\n\"In the first phase, more than 8,000 hectares of rice have been registered to participate in the project. The activities will lay the foundation for companies and farmers to link themselves and share profits. The project has proposed a measurement reporting, and verification system for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (MRV), recognised by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which can be applied on a large scale. Carbon credits from the project are not only traded at the project or national level, but can also enter the international voluntary carbon market,\" H\u00e0 added.\n\nAccording to the implementation orientation of the project \"Sustainable development of one million hectares of low-emission, high-quality rice cultivation, linked to green growth in the Mekong Delta by 2030\", Tam N\u00f4ng District has registered about 4,900 hectares of rice to participate in the project by the end of 2023, 12,000 hectares in 2025, and over 29,000 hectares in 2030 - equivalent to the entire rice area of the district. The expansion of rice cultivation area to reduce emissions is being implemented more urgently than ever.\n\nNgh\u0129a from the Tam N\u00f4ng Agricultural Services Centre highlighted that farmers in Tam N\u00f4ng, already adept at modern cultivation techniques and climate change adaptation, stand to benefit greatly from specific guidance, which could bolster the local agricultural sector. As awareness grows regarding the significance of modern technology in rice production, there's a gradual shift towards organic farming and the adoption of scientific methods, potentially becoming a widespread movement in the region.\n\nThe local transformation\n\nAccording to Decision 749/Q\u0110-TTg approving the \"National Digital Transformation Programme by 2025, with a vision to 2030,\" agriculture emerges as one of the eight priority sectors for digital transformation. This initiative aims to enhance productivity, quality and resource efficiency while reducing costs and fostering innovation across the agricultural value chain. Digital transformation is seen as essential for modernising the agricultural industry, boosting productivity and improving competitiveness domestically and internationally.\n\nRecognising the imperative and benefits of digital transformation, various localities in the Mekong Delta have initiated measures to promote digitalisation in agriculture. For instance, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 City's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is developing databases, digital platforms and agricultural management software, alongside conducting training sessions to educate farmers, cooperatives and businesses on digital transformation. Similarly, Ki\u00ean Giang Province's agriculture department has established an electronic trading platform for agricultural products and developed applications to support production management, disease prevention, weather forecasting and market information dissemination.\n\nWith active involvement from authorities, departments and farmers, the digital transformation in Mekong Delta agriculture is making strides, boosting productivity, quality and competitiveness while fostering sustainable development and improving farmers' livelihoods. Nonetheless, challenges such as limited technology infrastructure, digital skills among farmers, and rural access to digital services persist. Hence, a comprehensive approach focusing on infrastructure improvement, human resource development and collaboration among sectors, localities and businesses is crucial to expedite the digital transformation process and ensure the region's sustainable agricultural development.\n\nIn An Giang, between 2017 and 2022, the province implemented 710 new production development models incorporating high technology into rural agriculture, focusing on crop cultivation, livestock farming and aquaculture. These models have led to the adoption of effective digital transformation practices by farmers, cooperatives, and businesses.\n\nLarge farms now employ closed barns with automated systems for feeding, watering and waste collection, all remotely controlled via smartphones or computers, resulting in faster livestock development, reduced disease incidence, shorter breeding times and increased efficiency. Swiftlet breeding operations also benefit from remote management and monitoring, utilising cameras and automated mist sprayers to regulate conditions and monitor flock health without disturbing the birds.\n\nMeanwhile, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province has launched the Digital Transformation Project for the agriculture sector from 2022 to 2025, with a vision extending to 2030. Spearheaded by the provincial Digital Transformation Committee, the project focuses on digitising management data and implementing automation across various agricultural sectors. Through platforms like VDAPES, management systems for crop cultivation, livestock, aquaculture and rural development are being digitised to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Many cooperatives have embraced unmanned aerial vehicles for pesticide spraying, machine-planting rice and deploying sensor systems for irrigation management and pest monitoring. GIS technology is also leveraged for database management, enhancing pest forecasting and control efforts.\n\nIn \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, six smart water monitoring stations and 15 smart insect monitoring stations have been installed to support models applying Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in data collection for cultivation warning, forecasting and origin traceability. All origin traceability management data is integrated and managed on the digital data platform of the province's agriculture.\n\nA change of perspective\n\nMinister of Agriculture and Rural Development L\u00ea Minh Hoan stresses that the agriculture sector in Mekong Delta provinces faces unprecedented challenges across economic, social, and environmental aspects. To foster sustainable and efficient agriculture, breakthrough technology solutions are imperative, along with a shift towards high-value production models to uplift farmers economically. Minister Hoan advocates transitioning from agricultural production thinking to agricultural economy, highlighting fragrant rice and clean shrimp as prominent models for the Mekong Delta region.\n\nHowever, according to V\u0169 S\u01a1n from the Institute of Economic Development Research at H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City University of Economics, the details of digital transformation remain unclear to farmers, businesses and localities. Limited infrastructure for digital data systems and inadequate training in digital transformation hinder effective utilisation of digital tools among farmers. S\u01a1n recommends prioritising high-quality human resource training to meet the growing demand for digital transformation in the Mekong Delta and emphasises simplifying the concept of digital transformation while enhancing connectivity among stakeholders.\n\nNguy\u1ec5n Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Lam, director of the VCCI's C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 branch, underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy for digital transformation in Mekong Delta agriculture, based on vision, institutional framework, science, technology and structural changes. Lam suggests shifting the vision to align with modern agricultural development trends, establishing an enabling institutional framework, and embracing science and technology advancements such as mechanisation, digitisation and smart production.

Conceptualised as a Centre of Excellence, it will bring together faculty members from across departments and research centres of IIT Madras.\n\nProf V Kamakoti, director, IIT Madras, said that apart from the minor course in sustainability for all students at IIT Madras, the School plans to launch an Integrated Dual Degree Program (IDDD) on Sustainability in 3-5 yeas. \"This will also be offered to all students at IIT Madras, but unlike the minor, this will be a full-fledged Master's degree, including a thesis project,\" he said.\n\nIn the long term, the School of Sustainability at IIT Madras will develop professionals who can lead the world in building resilient and sustainable infrastructure for industries and communities, and act as a platform to catalyse the change to a low-carbon world by supporting the translation of research and knowledge to products and services.\n\nIIT Kanpur\n\nThe Kotak School of Sustainability at IIT Kanpur, which was inaugurated in December 2023, is India's first fully integrated school of sustainability that will run undergraduate and postgraduate programmes on skill building in different areas of sustainability. Current programmes on offer are a PGP in Sustainable Energy Engineering, e-Master's in Renewable Energy and E-Mobility, and short-term and QIP (quality improvement programmes) in various areas.\n\nOther IITs\n\nAlthough other IITs don't have dedicated schools of sustainability, they have started offering courses on sustainability. IIT Bombay, for instance, is setting up a Green Energy & Sustainability Research Hub - it recently got a donation of $18.6 million from a US-based alumnus. IIT Delhi is focusing on energy transition and sustainability at its Abu Dhabi campus - thanks to the UAE's push towards sustainability and climate change goals. \"Our new MTech programme will empower graduates with a thorough understanding of advanced technology and progressive policy frameworks to address the intricate challenges of energy transition,\" the institute said.\n\nIIT Kharagpur has set up the School of Environmental Science and Engineering (SESE) to provide a comprehensive understanding of our environment, and economical and effective engineering solutions to environmental problems.\n\nSustainability jobs\n\nAn education analyst told FE that there is a rising demand for graduates who have some kind of green skills. \"Between February 2022 and February 2023, LinkedIn job postings requiring at least one green skill have grown by a median of 15.2%,\" he said. \"Also, around the world, only one in eight workers has one or more green skills - we are far from the green skills penetration that we need. As companies reorient their business models, the need for employees with both specialist sustainability knowledge and an understanding of business fundamentals will rise. IITs know that there is a pressing need to have a skilled workforce with knowledge of SDG policies, and that's why they have increased focus on sustainability courses.\"", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vikram_chaudhary@financialexpress.com", "name": "Vikram Chaudhary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IIT-Hyderabad.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9525064", "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 452044331, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a97"}

NYSE: SNAP investors are rejoicing after the company reported a surprise profit in its Q1 2024 earnings report. The company also raised its outlook for Q2 2024 as a cherry on top. After disappointing investors for the past several quarters, expectations were low. This set up a perfect storm when the company took everyone by surprise on a number of solid metrics. The computer and technology sector companies surged over 30% the following day as bears scrambled and bulls dived back in.\n\nJust the day before Snap's earnings, social media bell weather Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META reported its earnings and suffered a 10% drop in reaction. This drop caused Snap investors to assume the worst, as sympathy selling caused a gap down the following morning. Meta Platform reported very strong results.\n\nWhat scared investors was the magnitude of the jump in capex spending the company announced as the \"Year of Efficiency\" seems to have ended and replaced with heavy capex spending (again). This time, Meta noted that it is ramping up capex for its artificial intelligence (AI) application LLAMA3, not the Metaverse. Prudent investors took the opportunity to buy the dip in Snap as shares rallied nearly 3% on the day heading into the earnings report.\n\nSNAP's daily chart illustrates a rectangle pattern that formed since its previous earnings gap down of 34% on February 7, 2024. The $12.39 gap fill marks the upper flat-top trendline of the rectangle, and $10.54 is the lower flat-bottom trendline. SNAP traded between the trendlines for three months heading into its Q1 2024 earnings report. The blowout report resulted in a 30% gap up the following morning, marking $13.78 as the new upper gap fill. The daily relative strength index surged through the 70-band. Pullback support is at $13.78, $12.39, $11.55 and $10.54.\n\nSnap reported Q1 2024 non-GAAP EPS of 3 cents versus consensus estimates for a loss of 26 cents, beating estimates by 29 cents. The net loss was still $305 million vs. $329 million in the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million versus $1 million last year. Revenues surged 21% YoY to $1.2 billion versus $1.12 consensus estimates. It's worth noting that the comparison to Q1 2023 was a low bar since it was the first quarter that Snap had reported a revenue decline.\n\nNorth American revenues saw 16% YoY growth, expanding 14 points higher QoQ. Rose of World (ROW) and Europe grew at a faster pace due to the adverse impact of the Middle East conflicts in the quarter.\n\nSnap guided up Q2 revenues to $1.225 billion to $1.255 billion versus $1.22 billion consensus estimates. DAU is expected to grow to 431 million, and adjusted EBITDA is forecast between $15 million and $45 million.\n\nSnap makes most of its revenues on advertising. Investors have waited with bated breath for the digital advertising slump to rebound, and it appears that it's underway. Advertising revenues rose 16% YoY to $1.11 billion. Snap had continually talked about restructuring its advertising platform as investors grew weary of the excuses. The cumulative effect triggered in this quarter is highlighted by the 31% YoY jump in total adjusted cost of revenues.\n\nSnap has undergone a stringent cost-cutting initiative as it cut 20% of its workforce in late 2022 and further cut another 10% of its headcount in its announcement in February 2024.\n\nSnapchat launched its new and improved version of Conversions API (CAPI) to all advertisers, which simplifies set up with less integration times. Snap partnered with Snowflake Inc. NYSE: SNOW to enable advertisers to use CAPI solutions without having to build a bespoke backend integration. The CAPI improvements have led to 300% YoY growth in CAPI integrations.\n\nSnap saw an 85% rise in active advertisers from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Direct response ads drove the surge in SMB growth as this group favors this type of advertising, which actually forces users to respond and provide feedback.\n\nSnap ramped up its AI and ML investments to support the direct response and brand-related ad platform, which saw ad revenues rise across all regions in the quarter. Snapchat+ subscribers tripled YoY, passing 9 million subscribers in the quarter. Continued investment in Generative AI models and automation to create ML and AI Lenses increased AI Lenses viewed by over 50% YoY. Snap also implemented a new AI assistant in Lens Studio to answer developer questions and guide developers through tutorials to build Lenses more easily.\n\nDaily active users (DAUs) rose 10% YoY to 422 million, an increase of 39 million users, beating analyst estimates by 1 million users. A DAU is interpreted as a registered Snapchat user who opens the Snapchat app one or more times during a defined 24-hour period. Average DAUs are calculated by taking the total DAUs each day divided by the number of days in the quarter.\n\nSnapchat reaches over 75% of the 13 to 34-year-old market in 25 countries, comprising more than 50% of the global ad market. Revenues per user also jumped 9.7% YoY in the quarter but fell 14% QoQ.\n\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel noted that Snapchat is ranked as the number one happiest platform, as 90% of its users say they feel comfortable and happy when using the platform. Spiegel talked up the success of its advertising platform, \"In Q1, ongoing momentum with our 70-pixel purchase optimization model led to a more than 75% increase in purchase-related conversions year-over-year. In addition, we are excited by the progress we're seeing with our small and medium-sized advertising partners.\"\n\nSpiegel noted that content creators and SMBs can promote their content and products with just a few taps on the Snapchat application. This has been the driving force behind the 85% YoY growth in SMB Snapchat advertisers. He pointed out that over 300 million people are engaged with augmented reality (AR) products daily, which is driving innovation.\n\nSpiegel concluded, \"We believe that our large and growing community, an innovative and engaging service that continues to evolve, and a strong balance sheet with positive free cash flow positions us well to achieve our long-term vision for augmented reality, which we believe will be one of the most meaningful advancements in computing that the world has ever seen.\"\n\nOn April 26, 2024, HSBC upgraded shares of SNAP to a Buy from Reduce.

The capital, home to nearly half of Costa Rica's population, faces an unprecedented challenge as water flow from surface sources plummets by up to 85%.\n\nProgrammed Cuts and Parched Neighborhoods\n\nResidents of San Jos\u00e9 are experiencing rotating water cuts, with some neighborhoods left dry for days on end. This disruption comes as a harsh reality for many, disrupting daily life and raising health and sanitation concerns. The water scarcity has reached a critical point where AyA has admitted its inability to ensure 24/7 water availability, marking a significant escalation in the country's perennial battle with dry season woes.\n\nRainfall Relief Delayed\n\nWhile the National Meteorological Institute anticipates the onset of the rainy season in early May, AyA officials caution that normal water service might not resume until the end of the month. San Jos\u00e9's water supply, primarily dependent on natural rainfall replenishing the Central Mountain Range, is critically low. This natural imbalance forces the city to confront its vulnerabilities and adapt quickly to diminishing resources.\n\nEmergency Measures and Infrastructure Overhaul\n\nIn response to the crisis, AyA has taken drastic measures to manage and supplement the city's water supply. The agency is now tapping into previously unplanned water sources, including wells and deploying tanker trucks to deliver emergency water supplies to the hardest-hit areas. Additionally, AyA has ramped up its efforts, fast-tracking over 40 infrastructure projects valued at more than half a million dollars. These projects are designed to enhance the water distribution network and ensure that the limited supplies are used as efficiently as possible.\n\nA Call for Sustainable Solutions\n\nThis crisis has underscored Costa Rica's urgent need for sustainable water management strategies. The country's reliance on seasonal rainfall makes it particularly vulnerable to climate fluctuations and extreme weather events like El Ni\u00f1o. To combat these challenges, Costa Rica must invest in resilient infrastructure that can withstand the stresses of climate change. This includes expanding rainwater harvesting capabilities, enhancing water recycling programs, and promoting water conservation practices among the public.\n\nLong-Term Strategies to Quench a Thirsty Nation\n\nBeyond immediate fixes, Costa Rica needs a comprehensive plan to secure its water future. This involves rethinking water usage in agriculture, industry, and urban planning to adapt to the new realities of climate variability. Education campaigns can play a crucial role in changing public attitudes towards water conservation, making every citizen a stakeholder in the country's water security.\n\nThe Role of Technology and Innovation\n\nAdvancements in technology could also provide breakthroughs in how Costa Rica manages its water resources. Smart water management systems that use real-time data to optimize water use and detect leaks could significantly reduce wastage. Moreover, investing in desalination technology, although costly, might become a necessary option as freshwater sources continue to dwindle.\n\nFacing the Future with Resolve\n\nAs Costa Rica grapples with this pressing issue, the path forward requires a blend of immediate action, strategic planning, and innovative thinking. The water crisis not only tests the resilience of Costa Rica's infrastructure and governance but also calls for a collective response from all sectors of society. Ensuring water security for future generations will demand sacrifices and changes in lifestyle but will lead to a more sustainable and water-wise nation.", "source": {"uri": "costaricantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jaco Super Ride"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-9513450", "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 452044310, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a9b"}

Dalits are ready to realise their dreams by breaking the stereotypes to emerge socially and economically stronger. In an interview to Shubhangi Khapre he says Viksit Dalit is going to become a reality by 2047. Excerpts:\n\nI will say with absolute certainty that this is the right time for the aspirational dalits to go begin startups. With a perfect ecosystem, those vying for entrepreneurship should capitalise the opportunity provided through Mudra and other startup schemes.\n\nWhat about the social and financial support system?\n\nThe DICCI working with the Union government of India has created what is now described as the 3M approach - Money, Mar-kets and Mentoring- for Sched-uled Caste-Scheduled Tribes (SC- ST) entrepreneurs. This is in adherence to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's vision of economic empowerment of the SC-STs.\n\nDoes it translate into reality?\n\nThe statistics don't lie. I have closely worked with policy making to its execution. I can say the total number of MSME owned by SC/ STs combined is 1.05 crore. In April 2015, the Government of India made 4 per cent procurement from SC / ST MSEs mandatory. In the fiscal year 2022-23, procurement from SC-ST entrepreneurs was Rs 1546.86 crore, from 10348 entrepreneurs.\n\nBut getting funds is not that simple, right?\n\nA) This is a misconception. Our role is to lead the eligible candidates through guidance to proper schemes. DICCI plays the role of catalyst informing candidates about financial support ranging from Rs.50,000 to Rs. 15 crore available to SC-ST entrepreneurs through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (Support from 50,000 to 10 lakh without collateral).\n\nMudra is the biggest ever measure in financial inclusion that has benefited SC-STs in India. The cumulative statistics for 9 years in FY 2022-23 show:\n\nIn terms of financial support, General received INR 18.01 lakh crore, SC received INR 2.87 lakh crore, ST received INR 1.04 lakh crore, and OBC received 5.76 lakh crore.\n\nWhat is DICCI's role in addressing the socio-economic issues?\n\nOur larger objective is economic empowerment of the dalits. I believe that dalits are a politically very aware class, both about their past and present struggles and challenges. The literacy level is 75 percent. It has to rise up to 100 per cent.\n\nIn 2024, Modi talks about Viksit Bharat? Where do dalits stand in the 2024 polls?\n\nI am not a politician. In Viksit Bharat 2047, I see Viksit dalit. The aspirational dalits are moving forward embracing diverse and newer fields like artificial intelligence, technology, communications.

Using his mind, he controls the movement of his artificial fingers, grips and dips a brush into ink and elegantly inscribes four Chinese characters on a piece of paper.\n\nThe four Chinese characters mean luck and hope -- many people would agree with the techie. The brain-computer interface, or BCI, technology, which controls the brain through mind and blurs the lines between humans and machines, promises technological innovation where the mind knows no bounds.\n\nChina, propelled by both the government and the private sector, is off the blocks in the global BCI race, trailing only the United States in certain segments. Chinese BCI firms are sharpening focus on both invasive and noninvasive niches of the emerging industry while the authorities concerned are seeking to get a grip on the formulation of regulatory rules.\n\nThe bionic hand was developed by BrainCo, a startup incubated at Harvard University and founded by Chinese engineer Han Bicheng. It was previously used by para-athlete Xu Jialing, the torch-bearer at the opening ceremony of the 4th Asian Para Games in Hangzhou last year.\n\nBrainCo uses BCI technology in its bionic arm and couples it with a bracelet-like array of electrode sensors on one's arm, enabling users to use their mind to interpret electromyographic neural signals and next execute actions like clenching fists, opening palms or even giving a thumbs-up.\n\nMore than 100 Chinese companies like BrainCo are seeking to excel in the BCI industry. According to a report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank, the trend in China is similar to the one in the US.\n\nThe US and China together accounted for two-thirds of the total 500 representative BCI companies in the world as of the end of the first quarter, meaning that both countries have a \"sound foundation\" for leading the industry in the future, the report said.\n\nAnother report from the China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute stated that the sales revenue of the global BCI market is expected to reach $3.7 billion by 2027. By 2040, the corresponding figure for China's BCI industry is expected to exceed 120 billion yuan ($16.9 billion), including sales of related equipment, which are expected to exceed 50 billion yuan.\n\nGao Xiaorong, a tenured professor at Tsinghua University, said: \"The ultimate goal of BCI development is to realize full integration of human brain and machine as one organic whole. As both China and the US are striving to drive progress in the BCI technology, the goal is likely to be achieved over the next 50 years.\"\n\nHexi Yujin, partner and senior vice-president of BrainCo, said: \"It is such technological innovation that propels industrial innovation, thus ultimately transforming into new quality productive forces for the industry.\"\n\nShe said BrainCo has developed a series of BCI technology applications, including bionic hands, sleep aids and stress relievers that promote mindfulness, which have all entered mass production.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cheng_yu@chinadaily.com.cn", "name": "Cheng Yu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202404/29/662edff5a31082fc2b6d03c7.jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-9523475", "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 452044280, "relevance": 5, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657a9d"}

I can turn on and off the lights in my house from 200 miles away if I need to. During the pandemic, we bought a new car without ever stepping out of the house.\n\nWhat's more, I don't have to wait for an entire week for my favorite Tom and Jerry show to watch a new episode. I can sit in my bed and binge eat and binge watch for hours on end. I get it.\n\nBut the point here is, we're also engaging with the world in a way that has become detrimental to our wellbeing. Our tech use is leading to dysfunctional relationships at work and in our personal lives with friends and strangers. There's something we have to do about it. Soon.\n\nHere's what Sean Parker, Meta's First President, had said in a whistleblower wave that had swept up the Silicon Valley insiders to come out and speak against the companies that they were building.\n\n\"Facebook literally changes your relationship with society, with each other. It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains. It's a social-validation feedback loop... exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. The inventors, creators ... understood this consciously, and we did it anyway.\"\n\nMeta was initially our social internet, where were are doing some harmless snooping around our friends' lives. We were showing off our cooking skills or our adventurous travel pictures.\n\nThen came the algorithms that started distorting our reality. Next came the concept of FOMO, fear of missing out. 7 out of 10 people feel the need to be on some form of social media, because of FOMO. The fear of missing out because you're not connected to your peer group is difficult. The choice can leave one feeling isolated.\n\nImagine the number of Meta invites, garage sales and school closure information you missing out on - can be one's validation to hang onto their online community. People report even having biological responses for fear of social anxiety.\n\nTouch and sensory exchange are necessary for emotional and social development. Understanding others through body language and subtle facial cues is only possible through one to one interaction. Skills like empathy and conflict resolutions can be learnt well only through physically engaging with others.\n\nRelationship knowledge is mutual. Unlike knowing facts, there is a consequence for knowing the knowledge. It determines how we engage with others, and how we communicate and collaborate with the world around us.\n\nBut look how we express outrage or discontent online. Instead of sharing valuable messages that have the capacity to scale quickly, we are using the internet to create digital drama and engage in cyber bullying.\n\nCursing, using crude and sassy comments, making jokes about weight, sexual orientation and political party affiliations. Try doing that in real person and see what happens.\n\n40% have experienced it and 73% have witnessed online harassment. You just have to look at the comments section of any article on any website to see the violent nature of the dark side of the internet. Trolls, cyber bullies abound - hiding behind fake screen names and masked IP addresses.\n\nDoxxing is a very common way of taking revenge online on people or harm the safety of a stranger or celebrity. Spiteful people spy on your personal data and publish it to harm you and your family. Doxxing is to search for and publish private or identifying information about (a particular individual) on the internet, typically with malicious intent.\n\nPhubbing is when people give their devices more company than their loved ones who're sitting across them in the same room. People attend parties, so that they can feed their #hashtag addiction by posting pictures of the event on their social media statuses. See those duck faced aunties pouting for selfies while giving the chills to their teenage children?\n\nNo one wants to dig deeper into any news. They look at things superficially and jump to conclusions. Most of us are just looking to be recreationally offended.\n\nGone are the days when movements and protests took weeks and months to organize. The means by which activists are making protests, petitions and persuasion tactics for change in mass mentality using online methods has risen to what's being referred to as Keyboard activism. Like in traditional activism, unfortunately, most people engage in this form of activism if its easy (in this case, a click of button to spread the message), non-committal and comes at no particular personal cost.\n\nGroomers or perverts, through DMs, are encouraging children and teens to send them explicit content in the guise of mentoring. Watch the Documentary: Keep This Between Us\n\nWhat: Teens share nude or semi-nude photos of themselves. Or forward compromising pictures of friends or others that they've received.\n\nStats: Around 15% of teens are sending sexts, nearly 27% of teens are receiving them. (Covenant Eyes Porn Stats, 2018)\n\nRisks: Legal trouble\n\nWhat: While they're seeking stimulation, strangers are seeking their attention. Kids are starving for attention and are befriending strangers on the internet.\n\nStats: 57% of teens have met a new friend online, and nearly 29% say they've made more than five friends in digital spaces (Lenhart, 2015)\n\nRisks: Psychological, mental and physical assaults\n\nThere are some games commonly referred to as \"condos\" and they are Roblox multiplayer sex games. These games are generated by users, where people talk about sex and where their avatars can engage in virtual sex. As expected, here's where Roblox rules cease to apply.\n\nAll you have to do is search for \"condo\" in the search bar on the site and games that display explicit scenes, naked avatars and crude language in the chat transcripts can manifest.\n\nThere's no need to panic, there are many places where you can find Parental controls on Roblox.\n\nHere's an excerpt from an article from Rolling Stone magazine:\n\n\"If you're single, struggling to reconcile the distance that the Internet somehow both creates and closes between potential partners, how better to avoid the social awkwardness of face-to-face interactions and assuage the fear of rejection than by sliding into some hot girl's DMs, comfortable in the illusion of a personal conversation without actually having one?\n\nPerhaps young people are putting off sex in increasing numbers because they're afraid that when the moment of intimacy actually arrives, they won't know how to act. Not that the movements won't come naturally, but that the accompanying emotional vulnerability we assume is supposed to exist will never arise afterward. Since 2008's economic decline, Millennials have found that delaying most aspects of adulthood is in their best interest.\n\nGoldman Sachs reported that so far in the 2010s, the median age for marriage is 30 - seven years later than in the 1970s. In 2012, a very meager 23 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds were married and living in their own households. For the first time in more than 130 years, adults aged 18 to 34 are more likely to live with their parents than with a partner.\n\nOverall, Millennials are pushing back the age of adulthood, usually as a reaction to our environment - the difficult-to-crack job market, and the ever-rising cost of rent. Sex is just another step toward becoming an adult that Millennials are avoiding.\"\n\n~ Inside the Awkward World of Millennial Dating on Rolling Stone.\n\nToday, an estimated 28% of all American homes are single-person households, according to a 2018 report from the US Census Bureau. Nearly 5% of the US population lives in retirement homes. More than 2 million Americans are incarcerated, according to a 2018 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nWe're so overstimulated that being alone has become unbearable -- a fact that was highlighted in a series of studies from 2014, where people preferred giving themselves electric shocks rather than sitting still alone in a room for 6 to 15 minutes. In the lab, we shock ourselves; in real life, we reach for our phones in a lecture hall, in line -- even when we're driving.\n\n~ Emily Esfahani Smith is the author of The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life that Matters.\n\nOn the surface, your relationship might seem perfect: You go out, s/he texts you and you spend almost every weekend together. There's just one problem: You haven't met a single one of his/her friends or family members, and you aren't sure whether they know of your existence.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a pandemic, there was an app called Clubhouse.\n\nThe optimal number of people within an ecosystem is 150 for participation. If Clubhouse doesn't die completely, only time will tell how people will keep up by adding and subtracting from their networks. It can be a productivity hamper. The FOMO of not being able to participate and voice out our opinions and ideas can get to you. The craving for \"claps\" can get to you. There are pop up rooms and some other rooms that last longer than marriages.\n\n\"Simply put, benching is when you like someone enough to keep spending time with them but not enough to commit in any given way -- situationships included. Instead, a bencher will keep you on your toes by arbitrarily asking you out when it's convenient. Usually, when their plans fall through, they're going through a personal crisis and need some buttering or the classic case of texting a cheeky \"you up?\" following FOMO on a Saturday night.\"\n\nThis trend involves someone trying to 'collect' as many partners as possible. These are people who they they're the best and can have anything and anyone they want.\n\nUrban Dictionary says, Pokemoning (also spelled \"Pok\u00e9moning\") is the act of dating multiple partners (or having multiple friends) in order to collect all the desired traits that's very likely to not exist in one single individual. Named so because you \"Gotta Catch 'Em All.\"\n\nDictionary says: To curve someone is \"to reject\" them, that is, veer away from their romantic interests and advances in an indirect, non-confrontational way. Cue, \"Sorry I just saw this message.\"\n\nThis happens when a person continues to interact with you on social media after you have stopped seeing each other. Haunting behaviors are often on the passive side (for example, liking your photo instead of commenting on it).\n\nFor those of us lucky enough to have them, freckles and their fickle nature are a familiar subject. Your skin might be clear as day from November through to March, but once you start spending more time in the sun, boom, a star map of little dots constellates across your face, only to fade when fall comes around.\n\nThe dating analog, of course, is the freckler -- someone who dips into your life when the weather's nice and then vanishes, vamoose, when the chill sets in.\n\nUnlike a summer fling, a passion-filled romance with someone you just met that only lasts for the summer, if you're getting freckled, it's often at the hands of someone you already know -- or know through friends, or friends of friends.\n\nGhosting is the practice of ending a personal relationship with someone by suddenly and without explanation withdrawing from all communication. Young people ghost each other these days after going on dates for a few times. They simply don't have the people skills to face the other person to say, \"Maybe this is not working out. Let's not hang out anymore.\"\n\nDating apps alter our behaviors. They erode our self-esteem because of the rejection we experience. We are constantly second guessing ourselves to understand if we are making the right choice. Too many options erode our decision-making muscle.\n\nLikes, comments, shares - This is the Attention Economy that we live in. Consequently, we are victims of the reinforcement paradigm. We are taking down pictures if they don't get enough likes. Middle school kids post mostly after 5pm on Instagram, so they can get the most activity on their posts.\n\nCreating a fictional character or false identity on a social networking site with the intention of preying on a specific victim is known as catfishing. The act may be carried out for monetary gain, to compromise the victim in some way, to purposefully anger the victim, or even for wish fulfillment.\n\nHotels, restaurants, books, movies - So many places you can champion the opinion on the internet. Ugh. Some books on Amazon.com have 3000 comments. Reddit is full of *$#$%*#$%#$%, that I know so many 20 year olds are spending their entire days reading and laughing across coffee shops all across the world. Who are these people who have the time to consume everything that's on the internet??? Why are we creating so much content?? Who's\n\nhaving the last laugh?\n\nWhen someone goes overboard with praises and accolades and then suddenly drops out of your life. It's not someone being flattering; it's someone faking being totally smitten when they aren't.\n\nDon't forget the professional costs associated with our crazy behaviors online. People are becoming victims of their own stupid behavior online, because the internet has the memory of an elephant. Internet is filled with social media fails that have led to employees getting canned from companies. Don't give yourself a chance to regret, \"Not my proudest moment!\"\n\nThink about this. Are we hyperconnected but lack in deep connections with even a few that we call close friends? Is there anyone among your online \"friends\" that you would like to spend more time with in person? Is social media making you more social or less?\n\nBottom line, it's important to remember that the online world is not the only world our children and we need.\n\nRelationships don't have to be emotionally unavailable. Our conversations on social media can be creative and civil. We don't have to be stuck in our own echo chambers of opinions and outrage. Remember this the algorithm wants you to be a asshole. But, you can allow not technology but your values to drive your behaviors.\n\nAsk yourself often, is technology really empowering me or enslaving me? And, think of ways to get off the screen and onto the scene. After all, you can't hug a close friend over the internet and won't experience your first kiss over Snapchat.\n\nWe can begin with our physical world, where we learn how to read people and truly understand them. When we communicate face to face with others, the mirror neurons in our brains help us deal with the other person's facial expressions and cues that their body is sending. As our brain interprets this data, our levels of dopamine rise when we hear something nice in what they're relaying to us. We start forming connections and building social currency by being understanding and diplomatic about others emotions and feelings.\n\nWe learn to find common ground, create rapport and build social networks in real life. And it starts at the family dinner table where there's no place for devices. Have memorable conversations in real life, and network well. Remember, a network is physical before its virtual and available online. Have memorable conversations in real life, and network well.\n\nInvite a friend for coffee over sending an emoji.

To understand, communicate, facilitate and translate. One group would be like \"Dem young people these days, ah cyar understand the way how they think\", and the other group would be like \"horse, what are they going on about, I don't get it\".\n\nThe thing is, though, although I am still very young (oh so young), I have a real soft spot for elderly people. Many have lived a full life and had many experiences. Listening to them is almost like watching a travel show, where each travel destination is more so a destination in time. Stories of how it used to be long ago, the superstitions, the manual labour of common \u00addaily living, the deeper friendships, the \u00adinterwoven communities.\n\nIn my deep dive of appreciating them, I have been trying to learn how to really communicate with them and not just understand their language, but understand their language of care.

To facilitate for this, one has to speak to the elderly on one topic at a time. Also speak more slowly, with less slang, plain, with minimal abbreviations -- but not too slow to seem condescending since they themselves are trying to compensate for and adapt to their slower processing speeds.\n\nAlmost like an older computer. When you open a large file, it just takes a longer time; and if you rush it, there is confusion, it gets stuck, and you have to restart. One trick the \u00adelderly do is repeat the said question to give their brain time to understand and process. A typical rhythm is:\n\n\"Where is the book that Michelle gave to you yesterday?\"\n\n\"The book?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That Michelle gave me yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nIf you are giving them some information, you would have to do it like a presentation for teaching. Give context at the beginning, make the point, repeat, have a micro-summary, repeat again with a jovial aspect, then at the end have a reminder summary. And after all that, still write it down for them to remember.\n\nThere is also a hyper focus on small, simple but specific things which they would hyper analyse and ruminate over. This is very important because if they ask you to help with something or do something for them, or if you made a promise of some sort, it is taken extremely seriously. Thus, if you disappoint them, there is much more hurt and toting than the issue should warrant. But remember, to them, it was vastly significant.\n\nRoutine is also a thing they take very seriously. If you are part of that routine, continue it and do not go contrary. If you call them around the same time every day, make every effort. The routines probably help with slowing cognition speed juxtaposed with a world going faster and changing every day.\n\nThey also hyper focus on health issues, expounding on every tweak of a muscle, every headache for a minute, every back pain, every soreness. Or they do the opposite and hide and deny the health issue. They ignore some big ulcer festering for a while. Or some new episode of dizziness. And sometimes they do a mixture. They hyper focus on minor things and ignore the major ones. So, when you are listening and zoning out with the minor complaints, you also have to listen out for the hint of something more serious.\n\nThere is also a need to vent or just talk to someone. So sometimes, they may not want you to contribute but more so, just to listen. For those times, you may need to have at least five token responses that you intersperse intermittently while you partially zone out. There is the baseline \"uh huh\", \"really\", \"okay\", then you can do the more exciting \"that happened!\", \"you lie!\" or \"she said that?\" Try to mix up the responses so it is perceived that you are extremely engaged and listening to every word.\n\nInterestingly enough, with hearing, smell and sight reducing, their need for touch becomes more acute. Touch is their main language of care. Just a small foot massage can be the world to them. A scalp massage, shoulder massage or even holding their hands makes them feel cared for. A lingering hug has all the words. Just putting your head on their lap the way you used to when you were a child makes them smile. Or just sitting in companionship even without active conversation. Just being in the middle of family members sometimes is enough.\n\nIt can all be a win-win. If we learn the elderly language of care and show them love and respect, then the generations coming up will follow our example and do the same for us when we get older. Creating the onion, layer upon layer, each giving back, each \u00adbegat, over and over.\n\n-- Dr Joanne F Paul is an emergency medicine lecturer with The UWI.", "source": {"uri": "trinidadexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Trinidad Express Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dr_joanne_paul@trinidadexpress.com", "name": "Dr Joanne Paul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/trinidadexpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/df/0df99ca8-9534-11ed-ae05-b3df1e9a649c/63c4992d4151a.image.jpg?crop=400%2C210%2C0%2C35&resize=400%2C210&order=crop%2Cresize", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 452044758, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aa3"}

She not only emceed with a fellow If You're Reading This writer, but also shared some of her own work. They welcomed the crowd and invited people to send in submissions to both magazines for their next publication, which will happen in fall 2024.\n\nTo kick off the night, Kathryn Gilmore, MCAS '24, read her poem \"Zombie Stars,\" a poem inspired by her senior thesis about the rebirth of stars.\n\n\"Not actually, but in a way, they act like zombies,\" Gilmore said.\n\nThe poem acted as an analogy about how Gilmore is a reborn star, as she is so different from what she was like in her youth.\n\nFour writers then took the stage to read poems about grief, heartbreak, and mental illness. Later, an author for If You're Reading This read her mini-poem series, including seven poems reflecting on the seven chakras of the body, a method she expressed improved her mental health after a major depression.\n\nHer recitation was moving, and each poem was titled after a chakra while the reader placed her hand on each chakra location to visually represent each poem.\n\nAfterward, the show opened up the floor to anyone who wanted to share their poetry. A couple of writers from the literary magazines, three non-member BC students, and even one non-BC student all raised their hands to go up on stage and share their writing.\n\nStumm took the stage again and explained an inside joke among The Stylus members.\n\n\"It is forbidden to write about your deceased cat,\" Stumm said. \"At least you can't explicitly say so.\"\n\nShe and two other writers then presented their poems about their insinuated deceased felines with poem titles such as \"Feline Deceased \" and \"Return to Sender.\" Although the small inside joke was funny and lighthearted, the effort and creativity put into each line of their poems highlighted the sincere talent the writers possess.\n\nAside from dead cats, dead dogs also seemed to be on the agenda for the night as one of The Stylus's senior editors, Nina Khaghany, MCAS '24, read a poem about the dead dog in Ulysses, the novel by James Joyce. As a classics major, Khaghany spoke about her time as a writer for The Stylus, and how she dreads leaving the amazing community.\n\nKhaghany and Stumm then went on to invite the audience to The Stylus' formal and publication party on Saturday, May 4 to celebrate the launch of their latest issue, where more of the same writers will have their work finally published.\n\nLastly, Stumm went on to invite audience members who did not get to read during the event to submit their work. She encouraged them to not only share their work with the world, but to use writing to process their own emotions.\n\n\"I am not very good with putting my emotions into words, but that's why I write,\" Stumm said as the event concluded.\n\nThe entire room clapped for one another as the night closed in celebration of the end of an amazing celebration of poetry, community, and mental health awareness.", "source": {"uri": "bcheights.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Heights"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_valenzuela@bcheights.com", "name": "Ashley Valenzuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/heights-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/28195555/Arts-Poetry-Parker-Leaf.png?fit=1528%2C838&ssl=1", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 452044701, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aa5"}

The maximum weekly payment is \u00a3184.30.\n\nThe cash can be used for things like special diets, clothing, additional laundry or cleaning and accessible taxis or fuel to get to hospital appointments.\n\nThe number of monthly new claimants in England and Wales, where the main condition was anxiety and depression, has soared from an average of 2,200 a month in 2019 to 5,300 a month last year.\n\nThe government has said spending on PIPs was expected to grow by 52% from 2023/24 to \u00a332.8bn by 2027/28.\n\nPaul Harris, from Barnard Castle, gets \u00a372.65 a week in PIP payments to help with extra costs associated with his anxiety and depression, such as counselling, once NHS support had ended, and specialist therapy apps.\n\nHe stopped his job as a property manager in 2016 after developing panic attacks that got so bad he would burst into tears in the office and lock himself in the toilet.\n\nHe has not been able to work since then and says PIP is the \"last stronghold\" of benefits that can support him.\n\nMr Harris says, \"I used to call myself zero, because I had zero money coming in. I had no job...so in a weird way, just a little bit of money coming in just sort of changed those thoughts.\"\n\nHe does receive employment and support allowance, but cannot claim job seekers' allowance because he says his mental health is a barrier to applying for jobs, despite previously seeking support from the Jobcentre.\n\nHe stresses the money he receives \"does not solve the problems\", adding, \"it's not a miracle cure, it doesn't mean we can go off on holidays and live this frivolous lifestyle.\"\n\nMr Harris doesn't believe there is enough long term support available for those with mental health issues.\n\n\"Some people might be able to do a few sessions of CBT, [cognitive behavioural therapy]... but when it comes to serious levels [of mental health] it would be like saying to a cancer patient you've only got 10 sessions of chemotherapy and then that's your lot\".\n\nThe proposals - which come in the form of a 12 week consultation - include making changes to the eligibility criteria for PIP.\n\nIt would consider whether current descriptors - such as the need for aids and appliances - are good indicators of extra costs.\n\nOther options include one-off grants for significant costs such as home adaptations or expensive equipment, and reimbursing claimants who provide receipts for purchases of aids, appliances or services.\n\nThey are also considering whether people with long-term conditions and disabilities would need to be assessed at all.\n\nJames Taylor, executive director of strategy at disability equality charity Scope, said the consultation doesn't fix the underlying issues.\n\nHe said, \"It's hard to have any faith that this consultation is about anything other than cutting the benefits bill, no matter the impact\".\n\nIt comes after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to strip GPs of their power to sign people off work as part of a plan to tackle what he calls the UK's \"sick note culture\".\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said \"We're making the biggest welfare reforms in a generation - protecting those most in need while supporting thousands into work as we modernise our benefit system to reflect the changing health landscape.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RFLQYZpqJJfGYjXQvt6YSg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/7754db3423a90b588d69d8dea93509e0", "eventUri": "eng-9519927", "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 452044540, "relevance": 3, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aa9"}

Colorado voters have zealously guarded that refund mechanism, rejecting measures that would redirect significant amounts to state programs, while approving some with limited spending figures.\n\nDemocrats with spending plans face a quandary this 2024-25 budget year, which is tight.\n\nConsider this: The \"set-aside\" -- general fund dollars that pay for bills still working their way through the process -- is only about $22 million, according to the budget narrative. About $3 million is already committed to sunset bills that reauthorize state programs.\n\nHowever, the lawmakers' wish list for general fund dollars is about $500 million. That means lawmakers will have to find a way to cut the costs of their spending priorities or see them go by the wayside.\n\nSo, lawmakers are turning to tax credits, particularly tax credits that tap the state's TABOR surplus.\n\nTo Democrats who are pushing for what amounts to spending reallocation from taxpayers to specific programs, the change is needed because the state doesn't invest enough in crucial areas, and it's more effective to focus a bigger amount on a specific need, rather than disperse money in smaller quantities among the population.\n\nCritics, meanwhile, countered that doing so takes away money from Coloradans, particularly those who need them the most, in order to fund \"special interest groups\" preferred by lawmakers.\n\nAt its core, the argument touches on the classic debate over whether it's best for government to spend people's money on specific priorities, under the assumption that it would produce the most benefit, or whether taxpayers should be able to keep -- in this case get back -- their dollars and spend it on their priorities.\n\nRep. Steven Woodrow, D-Denver, insisted he doesn't see the tax credit bills as spending down the TABOR surplus.\n\n\"We chronically underinvest in this state\" in areas such as infrastructure, education, and affordable housing,\" he told Colorado Politics recently. \"TABOR requires us to find mechanisms that incentivize the conduct we're trying to promote. When we look at how we can accomplish the things we need to, tax credits are what we have to work with.\"\n\nWoodrow said the question for lawmakers is whether those dollars should be returned to people in a \"less-than-equitable\" way or whether lawmakers can advance policy goals and investments.\n\nThat effort to tap TABOR began in earnest on April 8, with a committee passing the biggest of the 43 tax credit bills that remained alive.\n\nAnd some in the lawmakers' wish list would spend big dollars. Two measures -- one dealing with family tax credits and another for caregivers -- could take more than $900 million out of the TABOR surplus for 2024-25, estimated at $2 billion.\n\nIndeed, the wish lists for tax credit bills total $1.5 billion in 2024-25 and that amount will increase further in the years to come.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle are betting that taxpayers would be okay with giving up their TABOR refunds well into the future, should the majority of those measures pass, in order -- they say -- to provide funding for low-income families, seniors, health care and childcare workers, housing, the homeless and many others.\n\nTable of Tax Credits, 2024-25\n\nSponsors: tax credit could slash child poverty rate in half\n\nThe House Finance Committee recently greenlighted House Bill 1311, the Family Affordability Tax Credit, sponsored by Reps. Chris deGruy Kennedy of Lakewood and Jenny Willford of Northglenn.\n\nIt would tap $655 million from the TABOR surplus in 2024-25. In following years, the tax credits will tap $695 million, specifically targeting the six-tiered sales tax refund that goes out to taxpayers when they file their taxes every year.\n\nThe legislative declaration for HB 1311, as amended, said Colorado is projected to have $2 billion in revenue over the TABOR limit and will continue to have similar amounts available in the future.\n\n\"At a time when these resources are available, it is imperative that the state distribute them in order to make the greatest impact on families and the economy,\" the bill said.\n\nDespite having one of the fastest growing economies in the United States, Colorado is unaffordable for working families and more than 133,000 children are living in poverty, said deGruy Kennedy during the hearing on HB 1311.\n\nFamilies need six-figure incomes to afford a median-priced home. Even for the cheapest one-bedroom apartment, at $1,364 per month, a worker would need to work 77 hours per week, he said.\n\nPoverty in early childhood, deGruy Kennedy said, results in an increased risk of toxic stress that can disrupt brain development and increase the long-term cognitive risks over the course of a child's life. Eventually, that affects educational attainment, earnings, adult health, reliance on public benefits, and even arrest rates, he said.\n\nWillford told the committee that the tax credit would put money into the hands of families with children under the age of 16: Up to $4,400 per child would be available for families with children aged five and younger, while families with children up to the age of 16 could receive up to $2,400 per child combined with existing tax credits, including earned income and child care tax credits.\n\n\"This initiative could slash our child poverty rate in half, making Colorado a beacon of hope and progress in the fight against childhood poverty,\" Willford said.\n\nShe added that it's not just about alleviating immediate financial burdens. The funds would \"smooth\" the transition for families moving off of public benefits and incentivize workers to pursue higher-paying jobs, which helps address the state's workforce shortage.\n\nDeGruy Kennedy said the bill's structure addresses child poverty and helps families that aren't below the poverty line -- those that earn up to $95,000 in income for joint filers.\n\nAn individual with income below $25,000 would receive $3,200 per child for children under six years of age and about 75% of that amount for children between six years and under 17.\n\nKennedy acknowledged that, with the spending measures approved by lawmakers over the years, the TABOR surplus won't last forever.\n\nHe noted the patchwork of spending lawmakers have adopted in recent years, such as providing money for school supplies, diapers and car seats.\n\nDeGruy Kennedy said the fundamental problem is when a family lives below the poverty line. \"No piecemeal support\" solves the problems, he said, adding the tax credits would help families with housing and other expenses. He called the proposed spending a game changer.\n\nHB 1311 does not have a sunset or repeal date, although as amended, it would depend on the state's September revenue forecast and whether the surplus is sufficient to pay for it. In years when it's not, that could mean a reduced benefit or possibly no benefit at all. DeGruy Kennedy said he is open to a sunset or repeal date.\n\nCritic: 'Gob-stopping' price tag Featured Local Savings\n\nRep. Lisa Frizell, R-Castle Rock, while calling the program's price tag \"gob-stopping,\" argued that HB 1311 doesn't help seniors who live below the poverty line and rely on the \"meager\" tax exemption they get for the senior property tax program. And that property tax program is only for seniors who own their own homes, not for renters.\n\n(Another proposal, House Bill 1052, would create a housing tax credit for seniors who rent, taking $37.4 million from the TABOR surplus. The credit is not available to seniors who claim the homestead exemption but to seniors with an income below $70,000 per year, whether they rent or own a home.)\n\nThe next most significant tax credit bill is House Bill 1312, which would provide around $256 million per year in tax credits, also tapping the TABOR surplus, for someone working in the \"care workforce.\"\n\nUnder the bill, the tax credit would apply to a \"child care worker, home health-care worker, personal care aide, certified nursing assistant, or other qualifying personal care worker including a family member, friend, and neighbor who provides care.\"\n\nUnlike HB 1311, the care worker bill sunsets in 2034 and requires the state auditor to measure the bill's effectiveness.\n\nRep. Mary Young, D-Greeley -- one of the sponsors of the bill that would divert $65.8 million in TABOR surplus dollars to reduce property tax-assessed values on the homes of seniors who had previously qualified for the homestead exemption but have since moved -- said her measure continues the tradition of using those surplus dollars to fund this extension for seniors, who have relied on it for years.\n\nAll three likely meet the definition of \"people-centered tax policies,\" according to the Colorado Fiscal Institute.\n\nEsther Turcios, a deputy director with the Colorado Fiscal Institute who views taxation a \"tool of oppression,\" said that lawmakers can't change the TABOR revenue cap, even for \"worthy\" programs, such as increasing teacher pay.\n\n\"We know that all folks are taxpayers, from the lowest to the highest incomes. The money going back is going to the same people who pay it, but should be done in more targeted ways,\" she said.\n\nShe also argued that workers' wages \"have not kept up with the cost of living.\"\n\n\"If the TABOR surplus can be returned through targeted tax credits, that's the most people-centered way to do it,\" she said, adding people should start thinking about them as a \"collective pot of funds that help.\"\n\nShe said the market hasn't fixed the wage problem, so depending on it to raise wages to livable levels isn't working. Trickle-down economics, which involves giving tax breaks to the wealthiest few, hasn't worked, either, she claimed.\n\nAs to whether it \"wealth redistribution,\" a criticism raised by opponents of using the TABOR surplus, Turcios said it's misleading because it gives the impression that those who would receive those dollars are not paying taxes themselves. They pay sales taxes, a regressive tax, in which people at the lowest income level pay a higher percentage of their income than those at the highest income level.\n\n'How is that fair?'\n\nDuring the past two years, taxpayers have received equalized TABOR refunds.\n\nIn 2022, the refund was $750 per individual or $1,500 for joint filers, and this year, it is $800 per individual and $1,600 per joint filer. The first refund was a check issued just before the general election, which the governor considered a political ploy to sway voters. This year's refund will be applied to tax returns.\n\nBefore the 2022 refund, TABOR refunds were relatively small, when they existed.\n\nDuring the hearing on HB 1311, Natalie Menten of the TABOR Foundation noted that refunds have totaled $11.7 billion over 30 years, most of which have been in the last few years.\n\nTaxpayers have given up three times that amount for various state purposes, such as voter approval of Proposition 123 for affordable housing in 2022. That's expected to tap $270 million annually from the TABOR surplus.\n\n\"How is that fair?\" Menten asked during the HB 1311 hearing. \"How is it fair that you continue to take money from somebody who's making a moderate income?\"\n\nJon Caldara of the Independence Institute says the tax credits are a form of wealth redistribution.\n\n\"It's maddening,\" he told Colorado Politics.\n\n\"Let's keep in mind that candidate (and now governor) Jared Polis campaigned on ending special interest tax breaks and use that excess money to lower income taxes,\" Caldara said. Lawmakers \"are sucking away that extra revenue so there will never be another income tax cut,\" he said.\n\nIf the governor wants to lower income taxes -- a request he makes annually in his State of the State address, although he's never backed any proposals to do so in the General Assembly -- he needs to end these tax breaks for special interests, even the \"warm and fuzzy\" ones, Caldara said.\n\nA white paper from the Independence Institute noted that in his 2020 State of the State, Polis said he was \"enthusiastic about working to deliver permanent income tax relief, and we should continue down the path of eliminating tax breaks for special interests so that we can lower rates for everyone without reducing state revenue.\"\n\nInstead, the governor and the legislature have adopted more tax breaks, the white paper claimed, resulting in a $200 million smaller TABOR surplus for 2024-25, the Independence Institute said.\n\nFrizell, who sits on the finance committee, said spending down the surplus is a carve-out for special interest groups and taking money away from everyone.\n\n\"It shouldn't be directed to pet projects and special interest groups,\" she said.\n\n\"You have to look at how (the TABOR surplus) is being tapped\" and for whom, she said. As for HB 1312, she said she finds it problematic since it's intended to \"supplement income.\"\n\n\"This is a free market issue,\" Frizell said. \"If we have a need for care workers, and nobody is disputing that, we need to pay them appropriately. It's not the role of the state to incentivize that behavior and those professions.\"\n\nDiverting funding to these groups is not sustainable, she added.\n\nAnd what happens when the surplus disappears?\n\nThat's the $2 billion question, Frizell said, adding she worries about imposing obligations on the state that may not be sustainable.\n\n\"It's our money. It's our citizens' money. If (the surplus) ends, we don't get our money back,\" she said, adding she also worries that the tax credits will create a sense of entitlement.\n\nThe big questions remain: How many of these tax credits will make it to the governor's desk? And which approach does he favor? Or does he prefer not tapping TABOR at all?\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Their recent meeting at Cook County Jail was to discuss \"Dead Man Walking,\" a book writing by anti-death penalty activist Sister Helen Prejean. #bookclub\n\nCHICAGO -- For college senior Nana Ampofo, an unconventional book club inside one of the nation's largest jails has transformed her career ambitions.\n\nEach week, the 22-year-old drives a van of her DePaul University peers to Cook County Jail to discuss books with inmates and recently, the well-known activist Sister Helen Prejean. Ampofo comes prepared with thought-provoking questions to launch the conversations at the Chicago jail about the most recent books they've been reading together.\n\nOne club rule is clear: Discussions about personal lives are encouraged, but no questions are permitted about why other members are in jail.\n\n\"That's part of dehumanizing people. You want people to tell you their own story and have their own autonomy,\" Ampofo said. \"When you go in with an open mind, you see how similar people are to you.\"\n\nThe student-led volunteer effort started years ago as an offshoot of a DePaul program offering college credit classes at the jail on the city's southwest side for students and detainees. The book club, with a new cohort each academic quarter, tackles books that resonate personally with group members who are nearly all Black or Latino.\n\nAssociated Press journalists were allowed into the jail to observe the current club's final meeting to discuss Prejean's book \"Dead Man Walking,\" where the Louisiana anti-death penalty activist made a special appearance. The book, which was also adapted into a movie and an opera, is about her experiences as a spiritual adviser to a pair of men on death row in the 1980s.\n\nSitting in a circle inside a window-filled jail chapel, 10 inmates in tan jail-issued uniforms sat among four college students and Prejean, who visits the Catholic university in Chicago each year.\n\nAmpofo, who advocated for Prejean's visit, cried when she talked about how important the group members and their discussions are to her. And there were fierce nods when Steven Hayer, a detainee, discussed why many inmates return to jail.\n\n\"Our society doesn't invest in solutions,\" he said. \"And when they get out, they will go back to what they know.\"\n\nBook club members seized the chance to ask Prejean questions, including differences between the book and movie and what it's like to watch people die.\n\nThe 85-year-old nun has been present for seven executions. Her archival papers are housed at DePaul, including script notes for the 1995 movie starring Susan Sarandon.\n\nAfter witnessing her first execution, Prejean said she threw up, but decided that being with people in their final moments was a privilege.\n\n\"When you've been a witness to something, then that fire begins to burn in your heart for justice that we've got to change this,\" she said.\n\nAs a white woman who grew up in the South, Prejean said her prison work opened her eyes about racism.\n\nMost of the detained members of the book club are Black, mirroring demographics of the jail, which houses nearly 5,000 detainees. Roughly 70% of inmates are involved in some type of educational programming like the book club, according to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart.\n\nBut having college student participation sets the book club apart from other activities.\n\n\"When you all of a sudden have students from the outside, sitting next to you, you start thinking of yourself different,\" Dart said. \"It changes mentalities.\"\n\nDetainees are invited to participate based on their interests, he said. Their behavior on the inside determines their ability to join, not what they are serving time for, he added. Health issues are also taken into consideration.\n\nThe jail's wait list to get into the club has been up to 40 people.\n\nJarvis Wright, who has been detained at Cook County for two years, said he's a reader but had never been in a book club before. The 30-year-old reads at night when it's quiet at the jail. The other book club picks included \"The Color of Law,\" which delves into housing segregation.\n\n\"Even though we're sitting in here incarcerated doing time, awaiting trial for our cases, this gives us something positive to look forward to,\" Wright said. \"We're not in here just wasting time.\"\n\nDePaul has offered college classes through a national program called the Inside-Out Prison Exchange since 2012. Classes are held at both the Cook County Jail and the Stateville Correctional Center, a maximum security men's prison about 40 miles from Chicago.\n\nDuring book club, security guards are present, but no one is shackled.\n\nHelen Damon-Moore, who oversees the jail education programs at DePaul, says there has never been a security issue.\n\n\"They are all equal when they're inside,\" Damon-Moore said.\n\nStanley Allen, a 36-year-old detainee, said he was drawn to the club because it was linked to a college. He hopes to take classes for credit in the future. For him, the most surprising part of the club was meeting the college students and Prejean.\n\n\"There's really good people out there,\" he said.\n\nOther book club members say the experience has brought them close.\n\n\"I feel like I'm talking to a bunch of my brothers,\" Seven Clark, a DePaul sophomore from Chicago, told the group. \"They way you talk is so familiar. It feels like home.\"\n\nAmpofo is taking part in a new club at the jail focusing on Black women's writing. It's a topic that resonates with her as the American-born daughter of a Ghanian immigrant mom.\n\nThe first to graduate high school in her family, Ampofo is planning on graduate school to further pursue museum studies.

I was too busy slapping my forehead, trying to make sense of Makar's magic.\n\nI'm talking about the jaw of poor Winnipeg goalie Connor Hellebuyck. After he scraped his mandible off the ice of Ball Arena with the crowd going wild for Makar's goal, this best-of-seven NHL playoff series was over.\n\nNext!\n\nBring on Dallas or Las Vegas. Although the Jets remained one game from elimination after Colorado's 5-1 victory, they're already packed and ready for vacation in Cancun.\n\nAsked to describe his score that drove a stake through Winnipeg's heart, Makar went 100% hockey humble, insisting: \"It was a little bit of a lucky one.\"\n\nAu contraire, young Mr. Makar. We're the lucky ones.\n\nAlthough I could sit mesmerized in my chair and watch Makar score the Avalanche's third goal of Game 4 on a continuous loop all day, until I fell asleep and dreamed about it all night, let's step back and take a look at the big picture, shall we?\n\nThis is the new golden age of sports in Colorado, where things are so good it doesn't matter if the Rockies crumble into the National League cellar.\n\nIn a span of less than 24 hours, I might have been the only person in America that had the great good fortune to witness in person the magic made on the court and at the rink by Nuggets center Nikola Jokic and Makar.

But the greatest passer the NBA has ever seen casually slapped the basketball like a mosquito into the waiting hands of Michael Porter Jr. for a dunk.

Who needs to think when you're feet just go?\n\nAnd as someone blessed to have borne eyewitness to more than 10,000 games from NFL arenas to Olympic stadiums, I have never witnessed two more mind-bendingly beautiful plays in person on consecutive days in consecutive games than these two Hall of Fame highlights by Joker and Cale.\n\nThey have taken a sandblaster to the Mount Rushmore of Colorado sports.

That's a loaded question. While placing Orr at No. 1 is a truth that's self-evident, I invite argument by selecting six-time champion Doug Harvey of the Canadiens' dynasty at No. 2 and picking Detroit legend Nicklas Lidstrom over Ray Bourque third.\n\nBut given time and health, Makar will crack that top three.

During her first year as an ASU graduate student, Wormley was awarded a National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship, which provided her extensive funding to focus on research and travel to various conferences.\n\nShe's the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including the Cialdini Speaker Research Fund in 2024; the Study on Stress, Spirituality, and Health Catalyst Fund from the International Consortium on Psychosocial Stress, Spirituality, and Health; the Department of Psychology's Daryn and Marie Linder Graduate Fellowship in Social Psychology in 2023; and both the Outstanding Research Excellence Award and the Teaching Excellence Award from ASU's Graduate Professional Student Association in 2022.\n\nWormley's research focuses on interplay of ecology, culture and religion. She is known for integrating elements of popular culture into her work and gained national recognition for launching a new ASU course about the psychology of Taylor Swift.\n\nIn June, Wormley will embark on a postdoctoral research position at the University of Michigan's Emotion & Self-Control Lab. There, she will study culture in social media and emotion research, aligning with her broader goal of securing a faculty position to further her research, teaching and community engagement.\n\nAnswer: From my freshman year of college, I wanted to go to Arizona State University. My two undergraduate mentors, Drs. Oliver Sng and Joshua Ackerman, did their PhDs at ASU. I figured, if I wanted to be like them, I should do my best to follow in their footsteps.\n\nFor what we study, we are one of the top programs in the world, and I was incredibly honored to get to study here among the greats. Additionally, we have fantastic training in quantitative methods and pedagogy. The view of the mountains and the food in Phoenix are a nice plus!\n\nQ: Can you share more about your doctoral dissertation?\n\nA: My dissertation looks at how ecology can explain cultural variation, and I am advised by professors Michael Varnum and Adam Cohen. In understanding why cultures differ from one another, one might consider their ecology: the social and physical features of the environment relevant to an organism's fitness. Multiple theories propose that cultures and the individuals within them respond to the threats and opportunities offered by the ecology in predictable and adaptive ways. This dissertation demonstrates how ecology can -- but does not always - -- explain a significant portion of cultural variation.\n\nThe three published, first-authored, peer-reviewed articles featured in this work leverage best practices in archival data to demonstrate the relationship between ecology and cultural variation. The key takeaways? Average levels of ecology explain around 20% of the variance in culture and pathogen threat does not explain the existence of food taboos.\n\nQ: We've got to talk about it -- the popular Taylor Swift course -- can you share more about your experience teaching the class?\n\nA: When I got into graduate school, I never thought teaching would be the highlight of it. Teaching PSY 101: Introduction to Psychology and PSY 350: Introduction to Social Psychology was fun, but there is nothing like the Taylor Swift class. You have a group of students who are really motivated to be there and have already studied the fundamentals of psychology. That combo has led to incredible conversations about why people develop parasocial relationships with celebrities, the neuroscience underlying love, how lyrical music can distract us from studying, and, of course, the latest Taylor Swift gossip.\n\nMy students have really taken charge of creating a supportive classroom environment where we can be our authentic Swiftie selves and ask deep questions about human nature. My name may not go down in history for my research, but hopefully it will for this awesome class -- and I'm truly proud of that.\n\nQ: What professor taught you the most important lesson while at ASU?\n\nA: We have great faculty in our social psychology area, and they have all taught me a lot. But the first lesson I had to learn at ASU wasn't about theory or methods. I TA'ed for Professor Virginia Kwan my first semester for her Personality Psychology class. Before I gave my first lecture -- ever -- I practiced with Dr. Kwan. Her initial feedback was to be more confident. This goes beyond presenting. We need to have confidence in our research. We need to have confidence in our teams. We need to have confidence in our accomplishments.\n\nQ: Could you elaborate on any specific experiential learning opportunities that significantly influenced your academic and personal growth?\n\nA: My best experiences have been the traveling I got to do with this program. I got to spend my summers as a visiting scholar at New York University in the Social Identity and Morality Lab. I also got to participate in a summer intensive program sponsored by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology at Ohio State this summer and travel to conferences in the U.S. and abroad each year. All this traveling allowed me to meet really cool people and learn new perspectives for doing science. It helped me narrow down my own research interests but also enabled me to receive feedback on my research from outside perspectives. I also got to experience the different cultures and ecologies I study!\n\nQ: Can you share a challenging moment during your academic journey and how you overcame it?\n\nA: The toughest part of graduate school was being away from my support system, especially starting during the pandemic. I spent my first year at ASU without my family or my partner and did not get to meet with my classmates or professors in person. Being alone in my house for a year was really tough, but it gave me the time and space to delve into my studies. Still, it is important to build a strong, sustainable support system. I set up regular times to call my friends and family back home and made a point to come into the office once campus reopened. It may seem obvious, but the literature tells us that social support is one of the best ways to boost our mental health.\n\nQ: What's the best piece of advice you'd give to those still in school?\n\nA: Always have a passion project that is just yours. As a student, you are going to have homework, applications, obligations and late nights, but you cannot lose sight of what you are doing all of it for. Even if you only get to work on it once a month, having something fun to think about and practice your newfound skills on reminds you what you are working for. Sometimes, it even turns into something!\n\nQ: What was your favorite space on campus, whether studying, meeting friends or just thinking about life?\n\nA: My favorite spot on campus is Charlie's Caf\u00e9 in Biodesign. Caffeine, and just a quick walk from the psychology building on ASU's Tempe campus.\n\nQ: If someone gave you $40 million to solve one problem on our planet, what would you tackle?\n\nA: This is so nerdy, but infrastructure. My research has me thinking a lot about how our environment shapes our values, beliefs, and behaviors. One aspect of our environment is infrastructure -- our roads, our waterways, our bridges, our airports, our schools, our public transit -- and America has some of the worst infrastructure.\n\nI have a theory that increasing access to public transportation, especially, would solve issues related to carbon pollution, employment and mental health -- to name a few. Forty million would not be able to fully address the issue, but if we could conduct an experiment to demonstrate the benefits of simple repairs to infrastructure I think we would see some remarkable outcomes.", "source": {"uri": "news.asu.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "ASU News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_fields@news.asu.edu", "name": "Laura Fields", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": null, "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 452044469, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aaf"}

Francisco Seco/Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's troops have been forced to make a tactical retreat from three villages in the embattled east, the country's army chief said Sunday, warning of a worsening battlefield situation as Ukrainian forces wait for much-needed arms from a huge U.S. aid package to reach combat zones.\n\nCol. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi reported that Russian forces continue to attack \"along the entire front line\" of more than 620 miles, with pitched battles raging west of Avdiivka, the eastern city they took in February after a grueling, monthslong fight.\n\n\"The most difficult situation is in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions, where fierce battles continue,\" Syrskyi's said in an update posted to the Telegram messaging app, referencing two Ukrainian-held cities in the war-torn Donetsk region, once a hub of industry.\n\n\"The enemy has engaged up to four brigades in these directions, is trying to develop an offensive west of Avdiivka and Marinka, making its way to Pokrovsk and Kurakhove,\" Syrskyi added. \"Units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, preserving the lives and health of our defenders, moved to new frontiers west of Berdychi, Semenivka and Novomykhailivka.\"\n\nTwo of these front-line villages lie less than 31 miles east of Pokrovsk, while the third is located just over 19 miles by road from Kurakhove.\n\nA Washington-based think tank predicted late Saturday that Russian forces \"will likely make significant tactical gains in thec coming weeks,\" as acute ammunition shortages continue to hobble Ukraine's defense efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its latest operational assessment, the Institute for the Study of War said that Moscow's forces have opportunities to push forward around Avdiivka, and also threaten nearby Chasiv Yar. Its capture would give Russia control of a hilltop from which it can attack other key cities forming the backbone of Ukraine's eastern defenses.\n\nDespite this, the think tank assessed that neither of these efforts by Moscow are likely to cause Kyiv's defensive lines to collapse \"in the near term.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday confirmed that Moscow's troops had taken a village about 9 miles north of Avdiivka, days after the war institute reported on its likely capture early on Thursday. That day's assessment described Moscow's gains as \"relatively quick but still relatively marginal,\" adding that Russian troops had advanced by no more than 5 kilometers (3 miles) over the previous week.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden promised on Wednesday that U.S. weapons shipments would begin making their way into Ukraine within hours, as he signed into law a $95 billion measure -- $61 billion of which was allocated for Ukraine -- that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hot spots. The announcement marked an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, Russian drones struck the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Mykolaiv early Sunday, setting a hotel ablaze and damaging infrastructure, according to local officials.\n\nVitaliy Kim, the governor of Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv province, said that the drones \"seriously damaged\" a hotel in its namesake capital, sparking a fire that was later extinguished. Kim also reported that the strike damaged heat-generating infrastructure in the city. He added that there were no casualties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian state agency RIA reported that the strike on Mykolaiv targeted a shipyard where naval drones are assembled, as well as a hotel housing \"English-speaking mercenaries\" who have fought for Kyiv. The RIA report cited Sergei Lebedev, described as a coordinator of local pro-Moscow guerrillas. His comments couldn't be independently verified.\n\nAlso on Sunday morning, the Russian Defense Ministry said that 17 Ukrainian drones were downed overnight over four regions in the country's southwest. Three drones were intercepted near an oil depot in Lyudinovo, an industrial town about 230 kilometers (143 miles) north of the Ukrainian border, Gov. Vladislav Shapsha said.\n\nOne of the Ukrainian drones damaged communications infrastructure in Russia's southern Belgorod province, which borders Ukraine, Gov. Vyachaslav Gladkov said later on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry claimed Sunday that its forces had destroyed ammunition depots and military equipment housed at three airports across Ukraine, including assault drones stored at Kamyanka Airfield in the country's east. The ministry's online update said the attacks took place over the last 24 hours. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.\n\nRussian shelling on Saturday and overnight wounded at least seven civilians across Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials.

The Mekong Delta is witnessing a continuous digital transformation revolution in agriculture, unfolding every day and every hour.\n\nAmid the radiant sun and expansive rice fields nearing harvest season, farmer Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Khanh greeted us warmly, on his sun-darkened face a bright smile.\n\nAs he led us to see the rice fields, he pointed to the unmanned aerial vehicle flying above and said: \"I bought this T10 myself, then hired someone to operate it. The machine is spraying organic fertiliser to make the grains firm. Modern rice farming is different now, not like before, with many mechanical processes to take care of.\"\n\nKhanh, a prominent farmer in the \"land of pink lotus\" \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p, has gained recognition for his achievements growing Japanese rice varieties in Tam N\u00f4ng District. With a rice production area spanning 120 hectares, he is committed to adhering to the VietGAP standard. This involves reducing pesticide usage, producing high-quality and safe rice, and mitigating the environmental impact of fertilisers and chemicals. To achieve this goal, he utilises unmanned aerial vehicles and a range of other mechanical tools.\n\nKhanh said: \"Agricultural production according to VietGAP standards is different from traditional agriculture that uses a lot of fertiliser and chemicals. Cultivating three rice crops a year with that amount of fertiliser and chemicals will heavily pollute water sources and land. Applying VietGAP standards to the rice production process will reduce productivity, but with large-scale production, closed processes, and the use of modern technology in care, production costs will decrease, while product prices will be higher.\"\n\nRecognising the pivotal role of modern technology in rice cultivation, Khanh has invested in a range of advanced machinery, including unmanned aerial vehicles, electric pumps, ploughs, cultivators, combine harvesters, and excavators. Additionally, he employs smart sensor systems in the fields to monitor various factors such as water quality, pest presence and weather changes, enabling him to devise solutions proactively through his smartphone. With the aid of modern technology, Khanh efficiently manages his 120-hectare rice fields with just 30 workers.\n\nIn January 2024, Khanh expanded his commitment to sustainable agriculture by dedicating 32 hectares of his rice fields to the project \"Transforming the rice value chain in response to climate change and sustainable development in the Mekong Delta.\"\n\nThis initiative, backed by a A$17 million (US$10.8 million) investment from the Australian Government and executed by the Netherlands Development Organisation in collaboration with agricultural sectors in An Giang, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p and Ki\u00ean Giang provinces, aims to convert 200,000 hectares of rice to sustainable production in over six consecutive seasons from 2023 to 2028. This endeavour seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard the environment.\n\nAssessing the current landscape of rice production in Tam N\u00f4ng District, L\u00e2m Tr\u1ecdng Ngh\u0129a, deputy director of the Tam N\u00f4ng Agricultural Services Centre, notes that farmers face challenges in determining rice selling prices and reducing production costs. Despite potential limitations on productivity compared to traditional methods, cost reductions translate to increased profits. In regions like \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, where unpredictable weather disrupts the annual cycle, advanced technical solutions and modern technology enhance the resilience of rice plants to climate change, ensuring consistent productivity and quality.\n\nAccording to Tr\u1ea7n Thu H\u00e0, director of the project \"Transforming the rice value chain in response to climate change and sustainable development in the Mekong Delta\", the project has mobilised 11 reputable companies in the rice industry to collaborate with farmers and cooperatives in localities. These companies have brought excellent technology packages to ensure that farmers receive at least 30 per cent of the profits from rice production when implementing purchase contracts. The products can participate in the premium rice segment; and when carbon credits are sold, companies will also share profits with farmers.\n\n\"In the first phase, more than 8,000 hectares of rice have been registered to participate in the project. The activities will lay the foundation for companies and farmers to link themselves and share profits. The project has proposed a measurement reporting, and verification system for greenhouse gas emissions reduction (MRV), recognised by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which can be applied on a large scale. Carbon credits from the project are not only traded at the project or national level, but can also enter the international voluntary carbon market,\" H\u00e0 added.\n\nAccording to the implementation orientation of the project \"Sustainable development of one million hectares of low-emission, high-quality rice cultivation, linked to green growth in the Mekong Delta by 2030\", Tam N\u00f4ng District has registered about 4,900 hectares of rice to participate in the project by the end of 2023, 12,000 hectares in 2025, and over 29,000 hectares in 2030 - equivalent to the entire rice area of the district. The expansion of rice cultivation area to reduce emissions is being implemented more urgently than ever.\n\nNgh\u0129a from the Tam N\u00f4ng Agricultural Services Centre highlighted that farmers in Tam N\u00f4ng, already adept at modern cultivation techniques and climate change adaptation, stand to benefit greatly from specific guidance, which could bolster the local agricultural sector. As awareness grows regarding the significance of modern technology in rice production, there's a gradual shift towards organic farming and the adoption of scientific methods, potentially becoming a widespread movement in the region.\n\nThe local transformation\n\nAccording to Decision 749/Q\u0110-TTg approving the \"National Digital Transformation Programme by 2025, with a vision to 2030,\" agriculture emerges as one of the eight priority sectors for digital transformation. This initiative aims to enhance productivity, quality and resource efficiency while reducing costs and fostering innovation across the agricultural value chain. Digital transformation is seen as essential for modernising the agricultural industry, boosting productivity and improving competitiveness domestically and internationally.\n\nRecognising the imperative and benefits of digital transformation, various localities in the Mekong Delta have initiated measures to promote digitalisation in agriculture. For instance, C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 City's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is developing databases, digital platforms and agricultural management software, alongside conducting training sessions to educate farmers, cooperatives and businesses on digital transformation. Similarly, Ki\u00ean Giang Province's agriculture department has established an electronic trading platform for agricultural products and developed applications to support production management, disease prevention, weather forecasting and market information dissemination.\n\nWith active involvement from authorities, departments and farmers, the digital transformation in Mekong Delta agriculture is making strides, boosting productivity, quality and competitiveness while fostering sustainable development and improving farmers' livelihoods. Nonetheless, challenges such as limited technology infrastructure, digital skills among farmers, and rural access to digital services persist. Hence, a comprehensive approach focusing on infrastructure improvement, human resource development and collaboration among sectors, localities and businesses is crucial to expedite the digital transformation process and ensure the region's sustainable agricultural development.\n\nIn An Giang, between 2017 and 2022, the province implemented 710 new production development models incorporating high technology into rural agriculture, focusing on crop cultivation, livestock farming and aquaculture. These models have led to the adoption of effective digital transformation practices by farmers, cooperatives, and businesses.\n\nLarge farms now employ closed barns with automated systems for feeding, watering and waste collection, all remotely controlled via smartphones or computers, resulting in faster livestock development, reduced disease incidence, shorter breeding times and increased efficiency. Swiftlet breeding operations also benefit from remote management and monitoring, utilising cameras and automated mist sprayers to regulate conditions and monitor flock health without disturbing the birds.\n\nMeanwhile, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province has launched the Digital Transformation Project for the agriculture sector from 2022 to 2025, with a vision extending to 2030. Spearheaded by the provincial Digital Transformation Committee, the project focuses on digitising management data and implementing automation across various agricultural sectors. Through platforms like VDAPES, management systems for crop cultivation, livestock, aquaculture and rural development are being digitised to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Many cooperatives have embraced unmanned aerial vehicles for pesticide spraying, machine-planting rice and deploying sensor systems for irrigation management and pest monitoring. GIS technology is also leveraged for database management, enhancing pest forecasting and control efforts.\n\nIn \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, six smart water monitoring stations and 15 smart insect monitoring stations have been installed to support models applying Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in data collection for cultivation warning, forecasting and origin traceability. All origin traceability management data is integrated and managed on the digital data platform of the province's agriculture.\n\nA change of perspective\n\nMinister of Agriculture and Rural Development L\u00ea Minh Hoan stresses that the agriculture sector in Mekong Delta provinces faces unprecedented challenges across economic, social, and environmental aspects. To foster sustainable and efficient agriculture, breakthrough technology solutions are imperative, along with a shift towards high-value production models to uplift farmers economically. Minister Hoan advocates transitioning from agricultural production thinking to agricultural economy, highlighting fragrant rice and clean shrimp as prominent models for the Mekong Delta region.\n\nHowever, according to V\u0169 S\u01a1n from the Institute of Economic Development Research at H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City University of Economics, the details of digital transformation remain unclear to farmers, businesses and localities. Limited infrastructure for digital data systems and inadequate training in digital transformation hinder effective utilisation of digital tools among farmers. S\u01a1n recommends prioritising high-quality human resource training to meet the growing demand for digital transformation in the Mekong Delta and emphasises simplifying the concept of digital transformation while enhancing connectivity among stakeholders.\n\nNguy\u1ec5n Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Lam, director of the VCCI's C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 branch, underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy for digital transformation in Mekong Delta agriculture, based on vision, institutional framework, science, technology and structural changes. Lam suggests shifting the vision to align with modern agricultural development trends, establishing an enabling institutional framework, and embracing science and technology advancements such as mechanisation, digitisation and smart production. This transformation aims to enhance the quality and value of agricultural products while integrating agricultural production with broader economic and social development activities. -- VNS", "source": {"uri": "vietnamnet.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietNamNet News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static-images.vnncdn.net/files/publish/2024/4/28/digital-transformation-is-the-new-buzz-on-rice-fields-1048.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9521383", "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 452044369, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ab6"}

She also later served on the Order of Canada advisory council. In 2008, she was named Citizen of the Year in Prince Albert.\n\n\"So anything that happens in your own community is more precious than anything else,\" Malhotra said.\n\nThe pair were originally scheduled to receive the award in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nThe award celebrates an individual or individuals whose commitment to healthcare has made a significant and lasting contribution to the health and well-being of countless people in Prince Albert, central and northern Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Malhotra's moved to Prince Albert in the 1970s and quickly became pillars in the medical community. An obstetrician gynaecologist, Lalita became known for her work delivering babies in northern communities.\n\n\"Actually, Prince Albert found us. My husband was a paediatrician in England, and an associate clinic. Most of the doctors there were British,\" she explained\n\nShe said that after the people in Prince Albert saw his application they wanted him to come because there were no paediatricians.\n\n\"He was the only paediatrician for 10 years. But when we came here, I had one daughter, my older one who's here today, but I had no job .\"\n\nAll of Malholtra's children have also become doctors.\n\nAfter being presented the MNP Award for Outstanding Achievement in Healthcare she was draped in a Star Blanket by representatives from the Northern Lights Casino with assistance from PAGC Grand Chief Brian Hardlotte.\n\n\"You know the people from the north just embraced me and they just were so good. I had a very small office and they would sit outside on the floor because I only had 10 chairs and they waited,\" Malholtra said.\n\n\" And they have given me so much encouragement. And during this time of my practice, I found many other reasons to stay in the community,\" she added.\n\nIn 2022 the Victoria Hospital's new neonatal intensive care unit was named in her honour.\n\nShe said that the NICU was a legacy of the whole family.\n\n\"We also donated a room at Alfred Jenkins a Children's Room, so it's for their activities so, so the kids could have parties or whatever they wanted to do there, which was really good for them,\" Malhotra said.\n\nThe recipient of this award has demonstrated exemplary leadership and dedication and serves to recognize his unparalleled commitment, dedication, and work to improve the lives of those they serve.\n\nThe event featured a supper and entertainment by the Steadies. Malhotra was presented the award by Cody Barnett Executive Director of the Boreal Healthcare Foundation and MNP Prince Albert Partner Barb Hogeweide.\n\nBefore the award, friends and associates honoured Malholtra for her service to the community in a video presentation.

Castellano expressed his dissatisfaction with some of these recommendations at the meeting.\n\n\"I'm talking about the real world, not market value. When will people just stop and say, 'You know what? It's not worth it, $11 an hour. There's places out there that pay the $15.' And that's where I'm getting at, when you were going to say, 'I can still fill 428 employee positions at $11 an hour.' Are we kidding ourselves on that? Are we fully thinking that through?\" Castellano said.\n\nRosie Perez, president of the West Texas Alliance, a local grassroots union serving employees across SISD and Clint ISD, said teachers across the district are concerned that the district is pushing a rhetoric that increased teacher pay is to blame for the deficit.\n\n\"The message that has been perceived by my members from campuses that have already been visited (by district administration) was that, 'It was your fault because we gave you all employee raises. Now we are in this budget deficit,'\" Perez said.\n\nPerez, who worked as a teacher at SISD for 10 years, said there have been a \"series of missteps\" in multiple areas that have contributed to the district being in this deficit.\n\n\"It shouldn't be about blaming anybody at this point. What is done is done. Right now, it should be about what we need to do together to get out of this situation, to fix it, to resolve it,\" Perez said.\n\nPerez said she tries to educate her members that many districts across the state find themselves in similar situations due to the lack of additional funding for public education from the State of Texas. She also said she understands why some of these recommendations are being made, specifically increasing the cost of health insurance, but some are at a very high detriment to employees.\n\n\"When they are choosing not to do a pay increase for employees, it's going to affect not only their current income, the current increase on the health insurance, but then it's also going to negatively hurt their retirement for the calculation of their retirement pay,\" Perez said.\n\nShe explained that school district employees' wages are calculated into their retirement pay.\n\nThe West Texas Alliance created a task force that has developed some suggestions as to how the district could tackle the deficit.\n\nThese include reducing the learning day for students, cutting travel time for staff development, reducing catering costs, and potentially adopting the 4-day workweek.\n\nPerez said it would be important to have parents briefed on these suggestions, as it would impact them as well, and to see how the 4-day workweek has impacted San Elizario ISD, which adopted it for the 2023-2024 school year.", "source": {"uri": "ktsm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTSM 9 News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesus_baltazar@ktsm.com", "name": "Jesus Baltazar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.ktsm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2015/03/socorro_isd_courtesy_sisd_35039_ver1.0.png?strip=1&w=144", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 452044337, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ab8"}

Image: Morsl.\n\nAmpol has taken a leading position in Logistics and Manufacturing, partnering with Morsl to address access to fresh and nutritious food, with their micro market earning rave reviews from the team.\n\nIt recognises the impact this fundamental change can have on employee health and wellbeing for its Brisbane refinery workers. The refinery operates 24/7 with a workforce of 800 people, across a large, protected area that makes it challenging for the team to leave the premises during their breaks.\n\nThe recent CSIRO Healthy Diet Score Report showed employees working in Logistics and Manufacturing have some of the worst diets of any occupation, scoring 51.5/100 and 51.9/100 respectively. This is below the average Australian score of 55/100, which itself has been on a downward trajectory for the past eight years.\n\nThe report confirms that workplaces represent an important venue for influencing dietary behaviours. The challenges, especially within the Logistics and Manufacturing sectors, are shift work, the physically demanding tasks and the often-remote location of the workplace.\n\nAmpol recognised that the traditional caf\u00e9 set-up they had was not supportive of a 24/7 operation. With the caf\u00e9 closing weekdays at 2pm, night shift workers were not always able to purchase fresh or nutritious foods at times when they wanted it.\n\nTo solve this challenge, Ampol has partnered with Morsl, an innovative food solution provider that is transforming the industrial landscape across Australia with its better-for-you micro markets. Micro markets began in the US and are now the fastest growing food service channel across the US, with the largest concentration currently across manufacturing sites.\n\nMorsl's micro markets operate as a self-service caf\u00e9 or unattended store within a breakroom space that provides a rotating range of fresh sandwiches, wraps, salads, ready meals, sushi, and ready-to-eat options. This is combined with a broad variety of snacks and drinks that are managed according to a 70:30 balance between better-for-you and more indulgent options.\n\nIn such a micro market, the employee selects a product from an open rack display, or reach-in refrigerator, and scans the item at the self-checkout kiosk. The market, which operates under a monitored framework, is tailored to the demographics and working habits of the site to create a unique solution for each workplace.\n\nAmpol not only recognised the need for a new food solution for their employees but also the need to provide an engaging and fresh breakroom space for their vast array of teams to come together. A barista bar was also incorporated into the design to complement the Morsl micro-market, ensuring the team still has access to the theatrics and joy of fresh coffee.\n\nWhen the Morsl micro-market and their new breakroom space was recently launched, the Ampol team was blown away.\n\n\"It's a dramatic change and I think it's really what we need.\"\n\n\"It's great to have 24-hour options!\"\n\n\"A lot of different options, especially for me as a Coeliac.\"\n\nThe positive feedback has reinforced the significant impact access to good food can have on the daily working lives of an employee, which should be a fundamental part of any company's wellbeing strategy.\n\nWith Morsl's mission to improve the eating habits of Australian employees, its partnerships with the likes of Amazon, Inghams, Primo, DB Schenker and now Ampol, means it can play a key role in improving the diets of Logistics and Manufacturing workers to bring the industry above the national average according to the CSIRO Healthy Diet Score.

The capital, home to nearly half of Costa Rica's population, faces an unprecedented challenge as water flow from surface sources plummets by up to 85%.\n\nProgrammed Cuts and Parched Neighborhoods\n\nResidents of San Jos\u00e9 are experiencing rotating water cuts, with some neighborhoods left dry for days on end. This disruption comes as a harsh reality for many, disrupting daily life and raising health and sanitation concerns. The water scarcity has reached a critical point where AyA has admitted its inability to ensure 24/7 water availability, marking a significant escalation in the country's perennial battle with dry season woes.\n\nRainfall Relief Delayed\n\nWhile the National Meteorological Institute anticipates the onset of the rainy season in early May, AyA officials caution that normal water service might not resume until the end of the month. San Jos\u00e9's water supply, primarily dependent on natural rainfall replenishing the Central Mountain Range, is critically low. This natural imbalance forces the city to confront its vulnerabilities and adapt quickly to diminishing resources.\n\nEmergency Measures and Infrastructure Overhaul\n\nIn response to the crisis, AyA has taken drastic measures to manage and supplement the city's water supply. The agency is now tapping into previously unplanned water sources, including wells and deploying tanker trucks to deliver emergency water supplies to the hardest-hit areas. Additionally, AyA has ramped up its efforts, fast-tracking over 40 infrastructure projects valued at more than half a million dollars. These projects are designed to enhance the water distribution network and ensure that the limited supplies are used as efficiently as possible.\n\nA Call for Sustainable Solutions\n\nThis crisis has underscored Costa Rica's urgent need for sustainable water management strategies. The country's reliance on seasonal rainfall makes it particularly vulnerable to climate fluctuations and extreme weather events like El Ni\u00f1o. To combat these challenges, Costa Rica must invest in resilient infrastructure that can withstand the stresses of climate change. This includes expanding rainwater harvesting capabilities, enhancing water recycling programs, and promoting water conservation practices among the public.\n\nLong-Term Strategies to Quench a Thirsty Nation\n\nBeyond immediate fixes, Costa Rica needs a comprehensive plan to secure its water future. This involves rethinking water usage in agriculture, industry, and urban planning to adapt to the new realities of climate variability. Education campaigns can play a crucial role in changing public attitudes towards water conservation, making every citizen a stakeholder in the country's water security.\n\nThe Role of Technology and Innovation\n\nAdvancements in technology could also provide breakthroughs in how Costa Rica manages its water resources. Smart water management systems that use real-time data to optimize water use and detect leaks could significantly reduce wastage. Moreover, investing in desalination technology, although costly, might become a necessary option as freshwater sources continue to dwindle.\n\nFacing the Future with Resolve\n\nAs Costa Rica grapples with this pressing issue, the path forward requires a blend of immediate action, strategic planning, and innovative thinking. The water crisis not only tests the resilience of Costa Rica's infrastructure and governance but also calls for a collective response from all sectors of society. Ensuring water security for future generations will demand sacrifices and changes in lifestyle but will lead to a more sustainable and water-wise nation.", "source": {"uri": "costaricantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jaco Super Ride"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-9513450", "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 452044310, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aba"}

The groundwater table had gone down by 12 feet since Jan this year, according to the mines and geology department.\n\nThe groundwater, which was recorded at 10.26 metres during this Jan, has declined to 13.97 metres by the second week of April.The rapid depletion of groundwater table from the last few months owing to lack of rain has posed a big challenge to the district authorities to tackle drinking water crisis.\n\nThe groundwater table declined to 9.38 metres in Jan, further slumped to 9.98 metres in Feb and to 10.46 metres in March. In 2023 Jan, the groundwater stood at 7.96 metres, slumped to 9.20 metres in Feb and reached 10.23 metres in March. But this year the groundwater table which recorded 10.38 metres in Jan declined to 13.97 metres, said the sources.\n\nThis comes when Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has resorted to alternate day supply of drinking water to its residents in many parts of the city due to dip in yield at its water sources, mainly Kapila and Cauvery rivers.\n\nThough MCC was supplying nearly 330 MLD (million litres per day) of drinking water after pumping from the two rivers daily, but people living on the city's outskirts, mainly 40 new layouts, still depended on borewells for drinking water. MCC has also hired over 40 private borewells to supply drinking water to its residents in some areas. There are 17,000 borewells across Mysuru district, including over 1,200 in city limits.\n\nDeputy commissioner KV Rajendra, who heads the district groundwater committee, said that the district administration has already issued guidelines to residents to use drinking water judiciously this year owing to water levels plummeting in KRS and Kabini dams, as well as depletion of groundwater table caused by scarcity of rain.\n\nHe also said that he had issued guidelines for groundwater consumption by industries, commercial establishments, infrastructure development companies, mining units, entertainment and amusement parks in a bid to regulate use of groundwater.\n\nIt is mandatory for industries, commercial establishments, infrastructure development agencies, miners, agriculture, horticulture, drinking water, entertainment sector and the like, located in the city and districts for other purposes to obtain a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from competent authorities for the use of groundwater. Action will be taken against unregistered and unauthorised borewell riggers, if they are found illegally digging borewells in any part of Mysuru district, he said.\n\nWith groundwater levels depleting by the day to alarming proportions due to indiscreet use of groundwater, people were asked to self-regulate use of groundwater and look at alternative means of water sourcing such as rainwater harvesting and recharge of groundwater.\n\nFor farming, the district administration advocated farmers to adopt water feeding methods such as drip or sprinkler irrigation. Other users such as industries, entertainment parks, were advised to set up rainwater harvesting systems, water treatment plants, waste water recycling plants to meet their needs, he said.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109675111,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58174,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 452044615, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657abe"}

A potent and effective Fourth Estate is needed.\n\nThis addresses two concerns. One, the criticality of infrastructure build-up as a blanket platform that provides a basic pathway out of latent economic woes. And two, initiatives to develop an empowered, determined and dogged media that not simply reports on infrastructure, but asks the right questions and effectively investigates, audits, and keeps infrastructure's traditional propensity for fraud and corruption from burying us deeper in debt and destitution.\n\nThat second concern is important as many in media metamorphose into mere mouthpieces on one end and on the other, to survive, media meanders into entertainment, providing opium for cancers. As such, unfortunately providing no diagnoses, and thus, leading to no cures.\n\nBut first, an environmental scan.\n\nWe are not dead. At least not yet. Never mind that there are several vulnerable medium to small-scale enterprises, including former formidable corporate giants, who might think our economy is headed towards that inevitable condition as existential threats from incompetent economic management under the Marcos administration worsen.\n\nOne recent example is our continuing dependence on two of the most influential goods that account for the debilitating inflation that the diminished purchasing power of the peso and the high underemployment data simply cannot catch up with fast enough.\n\nEven kitchen table food staples like rice, sugar, even salt that account for a substantial portion of our basket of goods and the consumer price index remain stratospherically priced and imported. So does the manic-depressive roller-coaster ride in fuel prices whose weekly schizophrenia has led the public to completely capitulate and surrender its ill-fate to the oil companies and the limp-wristed bystander perspective of impotent energy authorities who oversee these sectors.\n\nDespite the undeniably positive directions taken by the Department of Agriculture (DA) - now under new, greatly improved, and professional management - to study, consult and provide focused support for Philippine rice farmers, the importation bias of the DA's former failed leadership remains. While such bias might temper rice prices a tad, traders and importers continue to be the primary beneficiaries, cursing by the wayside the historically victimized farmers already on subsistence mode.\n\nThe inequity that favors a select few at the expense of the many is characteristic of the renewed cronyism afflicting the headline inflation drivers from food to fuels.\n\nA case in point is the prospect of continuing in the business of rice planting by a moderately successful rice farmer who, as he barely ekes out a profit, is now threatened with having to defend his anemic income against a threatening tax audit. 'Dead\" is a word he eloquently uses to describe prospects for continuing his heroic entrepreneurship.\n\nIt is not surprising. Death is an appropriate word. Recently, even one of the largest and perhaps most iconic sugar refineries (central azucarera) was forced to permanently close, an inevitable demise catalyzed by the unbridled prohibitive costs of operations to provide a local staple relative to the importation of cheaper refined sugar. Its defining death, again a boon for a select few sugar traders and importers.\n\nRegarding the other catalyst of debilitating headline inflation, the dizzying ups and downs of fuel prices as well as the continuing power outages since the start of the year provides a tsunami of volatility that shelves capital formation, foreign direct investments (FDI) and keeps us at the end of the list of desired destinations among investors.\n\nWhen the late former president Benigno S. Aquino declared the Philippines as \"open for business,\" he realized the importance of both infrastructure and FDI as critical to alleviating structural economic inequities, the inflationary effects of food shortages, the surrender to foreign fuels and the curses we enumerated above.\n\nAquino's \"Private-Public Partnerships\" (PPP) program and the \"Build, build, build\" initiative needed FDI, both domestic and foreign capital, lest they exert tremendous fiscal burdens and necessitate aggressive taxation. Note that among recent presidents, only Aquino avoided new taxes while kicking off a series of tax reforms that increased the exemption brackets for the poor while effectively lowering income taxation for corporations. It is a belief in the Laffer Curve and supply-side economics where lowering taxation, increasing efficiencies, and reducing regulation promotes freer trade and development.\n\nAnd allow us to add, it reduces the amount of tax money stolen by crooks.\n\nTo avoid bloating debt, fiscal deficits, and increased taxation, such an initiative requires the infusion of private capital in infrastructure to lower the costs to process goods through individual value chains.\n\nNote how competently planned farm-to-market infrastructure shortens the gaps between farmers and consumers. Note how ports, railways, roads, and bridges reduce travel time, decrease instances of food waste and spoilage, and avoid those extortion \"checkpoints\" that artificially increase food prices. Note how farmer's markets, strategically located hubs, drying facilities, cold storage, and cold chain infrastructure funded by critical FDI and PPP can alleviate food inflation.\n\nSo here we invariably answer two of our reader's amazingly perceptive questions.\n\nPrivate sector capital is critical for infrastructure development, and we cannot back-burner that because of the negative effects of a transactional relationship between government and the private sector. That said, third-party watchdog audits, checks and balances, investigative reporting, and serious scrutiny by our threatened media - what was once a potent and effective Fourth Estate - is needed.\n\nDespite the conflicts of interest and the hidden snakes that live within the capital structures of most of local media, some have boldly taken mitigating measures. For instance, Rappler is constantly developing its independence using innovative forms to fortify its autonomy and financial freedom including attracting in-depth discourses and analyses, more extensive coverages and beefing up its in-house capacities to dive deeper into issues.\n\nIn the academe where the foundations and the future of our nation is formed, students and educators alongside mid-career media professionals are now undergoing extensive training and education on investigating the relationship between the private sector and government in infrastructure. These are recent developments catalyzed by the realization that crony capitalism has returned with a vengeance.", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/04/PPP-and-media.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 452044420, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ac0"}

I said, 'Amy, can we use one of your catalog titles, so it's going to be easier to clear them?' [Lily's] a girl. She's not going to choose to watch The Social Network or The Post, but maybe she's going to watch a Spider-Man cartoon, so I said, 'Why not Spider-Verse?' Now I realize that it sounded like an in-joke, which, you know, the unconscious guides us all the time.\"\n\nChallengers R DramaRomanceSports 4 /5 Release Date April 26, 2024 Director Luca Guadagnino Cast Zendaya Coleman , Josh O'Connor , Mike Faist Writers Justin Kuritzkes Studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Pascal Pictures\n\nWhile Zendaya does not voice any of the characters in Sony's animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, or its sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Universe, the actress is an integral part of Spider-Man's live-action presence in the MCU. Zendaya portrays Peter Parker's (Tom Holland) girlfriend, Michelle Jones-Watson, aka MJ. In addition to the Spider-Verse reference, Guadagnino also addressed the seemingly peachy nods to his 2017 film, Call Me by Your Name in Challengers.\n\nPeachy Nods to Call Me by Your Name?\n\nClose\n\nChallengers reigns as the No. 1 movie this weekend in theaters with an impressive $25-million worldwide debut. And while the steamy sports drama already offers audiences an all-consuming love triangle between Tashi (Zendaya), Art (Faist) and Patrick (Josh O'Connor), there appears to be a couple of Easter Eggs hiding in plain sight for fans of filmmaker Luca Guadagnino's 2017 romance, Call Me by Your Name.\n\nIn Call Me by Your Name, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's character, Elio, infamously pleasures himself sexually with a piece of fruit: a peach. His love interest, Oliver (Armie Hammer) finds him alone soon after and teases Elio by threatening to take a bite out of the now \"used\" peach! So, seeing a peach show up in a Guadagnino film can't help but conjure up images from Call Me by Your Name. But the Challengers director insists that the two -- yes two -- peach scenes in the Zendaya-led romance are not references to the ever-so-peachy Call Me by Your Name. Guadagnino said in another interview with EW:\n\nI think nods never should be gratuitous. But they were a nod because we are in Atlanta, and the symbol of Atlanta is a peach.\n\nRelated Challengers' Steamy Three-Way Kiss Almost Didn't Make the Cut, Cast Addresses the Film's Exhilarating Ending While Challengers' emotional ending is still being debated, the infamous three-way kiss almost didn't even end up in the movie.\n\nThe first sign of the peach in Challengers, which turns out isn't a reference to Guadagnino's best movie, is within a bowl as Art's tennis match looms. Since the movie was being shot in Atlanta, peaches -- the state's official fruit -- seemed like a no-brainer to use as a part of the set design. The second time a peach is spotted comes when Tashi and Art's daughter, Lily, enters carrying a \"furry peach.\" Guadagnino continued:\n\nThe daughter of Tashi and Art, when she comes into the hotel room in Atlanta, she asks for the attention of the mother. And she comes into the room holding a furry peach.\n\nWhether or not these references were intended or not, they're just peachy keen. At the end of the day, nods or not, Challengers is the No. 1 movie in the world. And Luca Guadagnino is enjoying the biggest opening weekend of his illustrious career.\n\nChallengers is now playing exclusively in theaters.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_thrash@movieweb.com", "name": "Steven Thrash", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spider-man-no-way-home-zendaya.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9519834", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 452044402, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ac1"}

She also later served on the Order of Canada advisory council. In 2008, she was named Citizen of the Year in Prince Albert.\n\n\"So anything that happens in your own community is more precious than anything else,\" Malhotra said.\n\nThe pair were originally scheduled to receive the award in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nThe award celebrates an individual or individuals whose commitment to healthcare has made a significant and lasting contribution to the health and well-being of countless people in Prince Albert, central and northern Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Malhotra's moved to Prince Albert in the 1970s and quickly became pillars in the medical community. An obstetrician gynaecologist, Lalita became known for her work delivering babies in northern communities.\n\n\"Actually, Prince Albert found us. My husband was a paediatrician in England, and an associate clinic. Most of the doctors there were British,\" she explained\n\nShe said that after the people in Prince Albert saw his application they wanted him to come because there were no paediatricians.\n\n\"He was the only paediatrician for 10 years. But when we came here, I had one daughter, my older one who's here today, but I had no job .\"\n\nAll of Malholtra's children have also become doctors.\n\nAfter being presented the MNP Award for Outstanding Achievement in Healthcare she was draped in a Star Blanket by representatives from the Northern Lights Casino with assistance from PAGC Grand Chief Brian Hardlotte.\n\n\"You know the people from the north just embraced me and they just were so good. I had a very small office and they would sit outside on the floor because I only had 10 chairs and they waited,\" Malholtra said.\n\n\" And they have given me so much encouragement. And during this time of my practice, I found many other reasons to stay in the community,\" she added.\n\nIn 2022 the Victoria Hospital's new neonatal intensive care unit was named in her honour.\n\nShe said that the NICU was a legacy of the whole family.\n\n\"We also donated a room at Alfred Jenkins a Children's Room, so it's for their activities so, so the kids could have parties or whatever they wanted to do there, which was really good for them,\" Malhotra said.\n\nThe recipient of this award has demonstrated exemplary leadership and dedication and serves to recognize his unparalleled commitment, dedication, and work to improve the lives of those they serve.\n\nThe event featured a supper and entertainment by the Steadies. Malhotra was presented the award by Cody Barnett Executive Director of the Boreal Healthcare Foundation and MNP Prince Albert Partner Barb Hogeweide.\n\nBefore the award, friends and associates honoured Malholtra for her service to the community in a video presentation. Malhotra did not make a speech but rather recorded one on video.\n\nFunds raised from Saturday's Gala will be put into the foundation's general fund.\n\nTotal fundraising numbers were not available but are expected after the weekend.", "source": {"uri": "paherald.sk.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Prince Albert Daily Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_oleksyn@paherald.sk.ca", "name": "Michael Oleksyn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://paherald.sk.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Med-Gala-Malholtra.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 452044347, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ac2"}

No other country has been more active than China in deploying huge amounts of wind and solar generation in the last few years. -- Bloomberg\n\nCHINA'S economy has become much less energy intensive over the last 40 years as its industries have modernised and the economy has shifted towards more service sector output.\n\nBut energy intensity has flatlined for the last five years, making it much harder to displace coal by renewables and meet the government's objective of capping total emissions.\n\nChina converted one tonne of standard coal or its equivalent in other forms of energy (including wind and solar generation) into gross domestic product worth 21,000 yuan in 2023.\n\nConversion of energy into economic output was essentially no more efficient than in 2018, after adjusting for inflation, according to estimates prepared by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nEnergy consumption has roughly tracked economic growth, rather than declining in relation to output as in other major economies.\n\nNo other country has been more active than China in deploying huge amounts of wind and solar generation in the last few years.\n\nHydro, wind, solar and nuclear generation supplied 17.5% of total energy consumption in 2022 up from 13.6% in 2017.\n\nMost of the gains have come at the expense of coal, which supplied 56% of total energy consumption down from 61% in 2017.\n\nBut economic output and energy consumption are growing so fast a smaller share has translated into more absolute use.\n\nUnless China boosts efficiency, most extra renewables will be used to meet increasing energy requirements rather than replace coal in the next few years.\n\nImprovement stalls\n\nBefore 2018, China achieved large and consistent annual reductions in energy intensity as heavy industries modernised and the economy's composition shifted from energy-intensive manufacturing to less energy-intensive services.\n\nThe share of energy-intensive primary and secondary industries in total economic output fell to 47% in 2017, down from 57% in 2007 and 65% in 1997.\n\nThe corresponding share of less energy-intensive services rose to 53% in 2017 from 43% in 2007 and 35% in 1997 (\"China Statistical Yearbook\", NBS, 2023).\n\nSome of the improvement in energy efficiency before 2018 was therefore more apparent than real, reflecting a change in the composition of output rather than better equipment and practices.\n\nSince 2018, however, there has been no further movement away from manufacturing and towards the services sector.\n\nSome of the stagnation likely reflects the impact of the coronavirus epidemic and the movement controls imposed in response.\n\nLockdowns and other social distancing measures hit personal services such as food, travel and entertainment particularly hard.\n\nAt the same time, the bursting of China's real estate bubble has hit a broad range of services linked to moving home and refurbishing.\n\nIn response, the government has focused on stimulating manufacturing to offset weakness in other parts of the economy and reduce dependence on imports from the United States and its allies.\n\nThe result is that the composition of the economy has become more not less energy intensive, offsetting any underlying efficiency improvements.\n\nRegaining momentum?\n\nSome of these changes are likely to prove temporary, especially those associated with the pandemic, while others may be permanent, including the focus on new industries and reducing reliance on imported technology.\n\nIf the economy resumes its gradual shift towards services, which seems likely as the pandemic effects wane, energy intensity will fall and apparent efficiency will rise again in the next few years.\n\nBut to the extent the focus on new industries, including electric vehicles, batteries and solar manufacturing, is permanent, there will be a structural increase in intensity and corresponding fall in apparent efficiency.\n\nThe focus on building new industries, indigenising the supply chain to reduce reliance on imported technology from the United States and its allies and boosting manufacturing exports have all resulted in higher energy consumption and pushed back the timeline for cutting coal consumption and emissions. -- Reuters\n\nJohn Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

The sobering reality of their situation: If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win their next three outings against the machine-like Bruins, it will be another crushing postseason disappointment for the Toronto organization and its rabid supporters.\n\nAn ailing Matthews was unable to play in the third period of Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3-1 loss in Game 4 at Scotiabank Arena on Saturday, part of a dysfunctional evening by the hosts that included verbal sniping between teammates on the bench.\n\nWith 48 hours between games, coach Sheldon Keefe is hoping the added time gives the Toronto center time to improve his health.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not much of an update there (but) luckily, again, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a couple of days here,\u00e2\u20ac Keefe said Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We thought the last couple of days would help us. For whatever reason it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not one of those run-of-the-mill, everyday type of illnesses that sort of come and go.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nTo what extent?\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The effects have lingered, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotten worse every time he gets out on the ice asserting himself,\u00e2\u20ac the coach said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just got to manage that and give him the time that he needs.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nUnfortunately for the Maple Leafs, time is running out on them.\n\nThey know it too, and it has spawned a powder keg of emotions boiling over after a disagreement on the bench in Game 4 had TV cameras showing William Nylander telling fellow forward Mitch Marner to stop \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crying.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nKeefe views the situation as teammates simply pushing each other.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I look at it as something that happens when things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going well,\u00e2\u20ac Keefe said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the past, quite honestly, that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have happened. Guys wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have talked it out, wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have, if you want to call it, argued it out.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I look at it as progress and that those guys care. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at it as frustration. I look at them being upset and (peeved) off that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver for the team, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pushing and challenging each other to get it right.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They know how important they are to the team. When they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not delivering, they recognize it. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at it much more than that. Quite honestly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the first time that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nBut will it be one of the last, given the fact that significant changes on the ice and off could be in the works if Toronto comes up short again?\n\nSince 2004 the Maple Leafs have won just one playoff series, against the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games in their best-of-7 Eastern Conference First Round last year.\n\nMore recently, the team will fall to 1-8 in postseason matchups since 2016 if they are eliminated by the Bruins this time around. Keep in mind that Matthews, Marner, Nylander and defenseman Morgan Rielly have been part of all of those and, along with captain John Tavares, are considered the core of this team.\n\nHaving said that, the postseason futility, at least in the past decade, is a clear message that something is not working. And don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if change is in the air.\n\nKeith Pelley, who was recently named CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, was in Boston for Games 1 and 2 and got a first-hand glimpse of the operation run by team president Brendan Shanahan. Meanwhile Brad Treliving, who replaced Kyle Dubas as general manager 11 months ago, will have a decision to make regarding the future of Keefe if the Bruins send Toronto packing in the next week.\n\nOn the ice, while Matthews, Nylander and Rielly have long-term contracts, Marner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal is up after next season. Despite the forward having a no-movement clause, he could be a candidate to be moved with free agency looming in the summer of 2025, even though the Maple Leafs playoff woes cut far deeper than just one player.\n\nThe forward has a goal and an assist in four playoff games this spring and has averaged almost a point per game (11 goals, 38 assists, 49 points in 54 outings) in his postseason career. If he does agree to be moved, can the Maple Leafs get comparable skill back in return?\n\nWhile that question remains hypothetical at this time, the following facts are not.\n\nThe Maple Leafs have failed to score more than two goals in 10 of their past 11 postseason games. They have lost six consecutive home playoff games, outscored 21-11 in the process.\n\nThree consecutive victories by Matthews and his teammates would change that narrative.

While tourists flock to this eco-paradise to witness exotic animals in their natural habitats, a concerning practice persists -- feeding wildlife for the sake of entertainment. This seemingly harmless act, driven by the desire for closer interaction with wildlife, carries hidden dangers that disrupt natural behaviors and endanger both animals and humans.\n\nTourist Ignorance and Operator Complicity\n\nDespite Costa Rica's global acclaim as an environmental steward, some tour operators exploit the naivety of tourists, encouraging them to feed wildlife to ensure guaranteed sightings and extraordinary encounters. This practice, often marketed as a unique feature of the tour, significantly alters the animals' behaviors, making them dependent on human-provided food. What many do not realize is that such actions can lead to aggressive animal behaviors, health problems for the wildlife, and potentially dangerous encounters.\n\nRepeated Offenses with Little Consequence\n\nIn the Central Pacific, notorious for its rich biodiversity, tour operators at T\u00e1rcoles River have made it a routine to feed the local crocodiles to thrill tourists with dramatic scenes reminiscent of wildlife documentaries. Such practices not only habituate these predators to associate humans with food but often lead to tragic outcomes when these wild creatures mistake a hand for a meal. Despite the legal prohibitions against feeding wildlife, enforcement remains lax, with minimal fines and rare legal repercussions for offenders.\n\nWildlife Laws and Lackluster Enforcement\n\nCosta Rica's wildlife conservation laws explicitly prohibit feeding wild animals. However, the Sistema Nacional de \u00c1reas de Conservaci\u00f3n (SINAC), the body responsible for enforcing these laws, faces significant challenges in monitoring and prosecuting these violations. The lack of resources and the need for physical evidence make it difficult for SINAC to effectively police these activities, especially in tourist-heavy areas like Manuel Antonio National Park and T\u00e1rcoles.\n\nManuel Antonio: A Case Study in Failed Policies\n\nPerhaps nowhere are the consequences of feeding wildlife more visible than in Manuel Antonio National Park. Here, capuchin monkeys, accustomed to being fed by visitors, boldly snatch food, and even personal belongings, from unsuspecting tourists. Despite clear signage and bag checks at park entrances, enforcement is minimal, hindered by insufficient staffing and resource allocation.\n\nEducational Efforts and Community Advocacy\n\nOne potential solution lies in better education and clearer communication. Enhancing signage to explain the reasons behind the prohibition of feeding wildlife could help cultivate more respectful and informed behaviors among tourists. Additionally, community advocacy is crucial in prompting governmental action to allocate more resources to SINAC, enabling them to hire additional personnel and strengthen their presence in key areas.\n\nA Call for Sustainable Practices in Ecotourism\n\nThe ongoing issues highlight a critical need for sustainable tourism practices that respect wildlife and preserve Costa Rica's ecological integrity. Tour operators and tourists alike must be educated about the long-term impacts of feeding wildlife, promoting a shift towards more responsible and ethical interactions with nature.\n\nFor the Love of Wildlife\n\nAs Costa Rica continues to attract global tourists with its biodiversity, the responsibility to protect its natural treasures grows. Only through collective efforts to enforce laws, educate the public, and foster ethical tourism practices can Costa Rica ensure that its wildlife thrives and continues to be a source of national pride and ecological wonder.", "source": {"uri": "costaricantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jaco Super Ride"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-9534085", "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 452043524, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657acd"}

Despite the family connection, however, the elder Hawke doesn't know a thing about the final season of Stranger Things.\n\nPer People, Hawke shared how Maya is currently working on the fifth and final season of Stranger Things. The actor remarked on how it felt to be able to geek out to a TV series while simultaneously feeling proud as a father when watching Hawke's portrayal of Robin Buckley. He also admitted to trying to get Stranger Things spoilers for the final episodes, eager to see what will happen next in the last season, but Maya is apparently not trusting him to keep that information to himself.\n\nRelated Stranger Things Star Teases Eddie Munson's Return in Final Season Joseph Quinn comments on the possibility of Eddie Munson making an appearance in the final season of Stranger Things.\n\n\"I can be proud of her and geek out with so much joy when I watch Stranger Things,\" he said. On trying to get spoilers, Hawke added, \"I nudge her for them and she won't give them up! She says, 'You've got a big mouth.' So nope, not even to dear old dad.\"\n\nEthan Hawke Directs a New Maya Hawke Movie\n\nThe Hawkes also have a new movie they collaborated on that's soon set to be released. The feature film Wildcat, which hits theaters on May 3, is directed by Ethan with Maya featured in a prominent role. Ethan said how he has similarly been impressed with his daughter's work on Wildcat, but he tried not to let it show too much on the set for the sake of maintaining professionalism.\n\nRelated Stranger Things Season 5 Set Video Reveals Return to Iconic Location A new behind-the-scenes set video from Stranger Things Season 5 confirms a return to one of Hawkins' most iconic locations. Close\n\n\"I worried I would fail her if I did that,\" Hawke said. \"We had so many amazing collaborators, and all these very serious artists that were there to try to make a serious work. They weren't there for it to be cute or for us to make a home movie... When I'm directing her, I have a job to do which is to make sure we accomplish that goal.\"\n\nHe added, \"Maya wanted to make a movie about a fiery young woman who's complicated. The world is full of movies about complicated men and their relationship to their work... She was like, 'I see all these movies with Gene Hackman and Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman, and all these things you keep telling me are so great. I want to play a screwed up person too.'

The original Mr Squiggle marionette and more than 800 related objects, including fellow puppets, artworks, scripts, costumes, props, sets, production notes, merchandise and audio-visual material, have joined the National Historical Collection 65 years after first debuting on Australian television.\n\nThe extraordinary collection captures the life's work of Norman Hetherington, master puppeteer, cartoonist, artist and performer who was the genius and the voice behind the characters who featured in Mr Squiggle and Friends.\n\nKatherine McMahon, Director of the National Museum, expressed her own excitement at the arrival of the collection.\n\n'Mr Squiggle was a feature of my childhood and I, along with generations of Australian children, was enchanted and inspired to draw by Mr Squiggle, who starred in one of the nation's longest running and most beloved television series,' Ms McMahon said.\n\n'We can't wait to share the collection with Australia and give grandparents and parents the opportunity to revisit their childhoods and share their memories with today's little ones,' Ms McMahon said.\n\nMs McMahon paid tribute to Mr Hetherington's daughter, known to many Australians as 'Miss Rebecca'.

Directed by Chris Columbus and based on Richard Osman's debut novel, the mystery comedy film follows a group of pensioners investigating a murder.

After a period of over three years with little information about the production, Netflix revealed their involvement in April 2024.\n\nAuthor Richard Osman expressed his excitement about the project, highlighting the talented individuals involved, including director Chris Columbus and the impressive cast. As for the release date, it remains unclear, but Osman confirmed that filming is scheduled to take place from the end of June to September 2024 in England.

One of the biggest frustrations with former coach Bill Belichick was his tendency to plug players into places that weren't their natural positions.\n\nSo it's understandable why there are some serious concerns with the Wallace pick. With that said, Wallace is a four-year starter with the athleticism to play every spot on the offensive line. He was one of the most experienced offensive linemen on the entire draft board, and he's clearly one of the most versatile. Perhaps his biggest problem is that he was overshadowed by Olu Fashanu at Penn State.\n\nMake no mistake, Wallace played incredibly well in the role given to him, and that's really all he could do as a player. Here's how NFL experts are grading the Patriots' third-round pick:\n\nUSA Today: C\n\nMar 3, 2024; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Penn State offensive lineman Caedan Wallace (OL70) during the 2024 NFL Scouting Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz:\n\nEliot Wolf's mission to reconfigure New England's offense continues, as he turns his attention to the Patriots' front. Wallace can handle some kind of role along the line, but serving as Drake Maye's blindside protector seems like a stretch.\n\nThe Athletic: B+\n\nPenn State offensive lineman Caedan Wallace (73) prepares for a play during a White Out football game against Iowa Saturday, Sept. 23, 2023, in State College, Pa. The Nittany Lions shut out the Hawkeyes, 31-0.\n\nFrom Nick Baumgardner:\n\nThe right tackle opposite Olu Fashanu at Penn State, Wallace is a huge man (10 3/4-inch hands and 34-inch arms). He also plays with great explosion and good speed into the second level as a road-grading blocker. Wallace is 24 years old, and there are some technique inconsistencies that might just be part of life, but he's a powerful run blocker who moves people at the point of attack.\n\nBleacher Report: B\n\nOct 21, 2023; Columbus, Ohio, USA; Ohio State Buckeyes defensive end JT Tuimoloau (44) gets up against Penn State Nittany Lions offensive lineman Caedan Wallace (73) during the first quarter of their game at Ohio Stadium.\n\nFrom Brent Sobleski:\n\nThe New England Patriots waited a little longer than expected to address their offensive line. They can't be faulted for adding a wide receiver in the second round to help quarterback Drake Maye. Wallace can take over at right tackle, thus pushing Mike Onwenu inside to guard. That would solve one side of New England's offensive front.\n\nCBS Sports: C-\n\nPenn State redshirt-junior offensive lineman Caedan Wallace rests on a bench during football media day at Beaver Stadium on Saturday, August 6, 2022, in State College.\n\nFrom Chris Trapasso:\n\nSizable framed OT with lumbering feet. Average-at-best athlete. Plays with good calmness and accuracy at second level and has quality power but overall athletic profile was severely threatened often in college. A concern for his NFL future. New England did need to add some OL depth. Worried about his upside.\n\nSports Illustrated: D+\n\nMar 2, 2024; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Penn State offensive lineman Caedan Wallace (OL70) talks to the media during the 2024 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom Matt Verderame:\n\nPlaying right tackle, Wallace is a bit of a project. The big question is whether he can kick quickly enough to stay at tackle. The Patriots need an improved line for Drake Maye, and this is an effort in that vein.\n\nSB Nation: F\n\nOffensive lineman Caedan Wallace participates in a drill during Penn State's Pro Day on March 15, 2024, in State College.\n\nFrom Joseph Acosta:\n\nHey man...did the Pats let Bill Belichick back in the draft room?\n\nSporting News: D\n\nMar 3, 2024; Indianapolis, IN, USA; Penn State offensive lineman Caedan Wallace (OL70) during the 2024 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium.

New England has a major need at the position, so it isn't a surprise to see them strike for tackle in the third round. However, the likes of Yale's Kiran Amegadjie are still on the board.\n\nOn the plus side, Wallace gives the Patriots -- and new QB Maye -- a pass protector with the play strength to handle himself in the NFL. He also possesses a decent anchor, which should give their new quarterback some time to work with.\n\nA potential move inside to guard also impacts the pick grade here.", "source": {"uri": "patriotswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Patriots Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordy_mcelroy@patriotswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Jordy McElroy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2024/04/USATSI_21771029.jpg?w=640", "eventUri": "eng-9517684", "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 452044760, "relevance": 6, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ad6"}

Following his step down from royal duties in 2020, the Royal Family stripped Prince Harry of three of his honorary military titles, among other royal entitlements and privileges. While the move ultimately makes it unlikely for him to earn more Jubilee medals or military badges, the Prince got to keep his previous decorations, each having a history deeply rooted in his royal life post-Megxit.\n\nPrince Harry took a walk down that life recently by donning not one but four decorative medals honoring his years in the military and, by extension, a senior royal. The Duke of Sussex did the honors of presenting the Military Times' Soldier of the Year award to US combat medic Sergeant First Class Elizabeth Marks on April 26. Marks, who Harry described as a \"friend\" and \"beacon of Inspiration,\" is a four-time Invictus Games gold medalist. She first crossed paths with Prince Harry in 2016, where she received four gold medals for her participation in Swimming.\n\nThe combat medic joined the US Army in 2008. However, she sustained bilateral hip injuries barely two years later during her deployment to Iran. Despite the injuries' detrimental effect on her military dreams, Marks has continued to be outstanding. She proved her resilience during the Invictus Games, a \"free platform for international wounded, injured and sick (WIS) armed forces personnel\" to find recovery through sports.\n\nWhile his connection to her as the Invictus Games founder made him one of the most worthy people to do Marks the honors, the internet thinks enlisting Prince Harry was one big flop. One enraged netizen fired on Reddit,\n\n\"We didn't have an American Veteran who could do this?\"\n\nA third wrote,\n\n\"Harry will do anything for attention and money. I don't know why the magazine thought he was an appropriate presenter.\"\n\nMeanwhile, most netizens were more outraged by Prince Harry's decision to decorate himself with four army medals during the presentation. According to them, wearing the medals despite being stripped of his military titles was an embarrassing attempt to steal the spotlight from Sergeant First Class Elizabeth Mark. X users also got in on the action, making scathing remarks about the prince. One wrote,\n\n\"Good god, how pathetic. He's lopsided! He needs someone to advise him on optics. The participation medals are a sad cry for 'looook at meeeeeeeee'.\"\n\nAnother quipped,\n\n\"Bunker Harry looks like a moron wearing those medals.\"\n\nA third added,\n\n\"Why is everything these two produce out of focus? Those medals are ridiculous.\"\n\nIn the video capturing his presentation speech, Prince Harry, standing outside his home in Montecito, California, appeared fully decorated with four medals earned during his time as a working royal. He received one of the medals in 2008 for his operational service in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the other three were the late Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal, Diamond Jubilee Medal and Platinum Jubilee Medal awarded him in 2002, 2012 and 2020, respectively.\n\nEach medal, pinned to Prince Harry's black blazer, represents a significant moment in the royal life he's strived so hard to bid farewell to. Perhaps more than his supposed quest for attention, the Sussex royal hoped to honor his late grandmother, his military service, his connection to Marks, and ultimately, his commitment to the heart of Invictus.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "judith_ike@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Judith Ike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Prince-Harry-speech.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9515149", "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 452044691, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ad7"}

Obviously, you got a lot of Knicks fans, and they're down the road, and I've never seen it, and I've been here for 10 years.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it kind of pi---s me off, especially because Philly is considered a sports town.

I'm an Eagles fan, I would know.

Gusto kong ipagpatuloy 'yung kampanya laban sa iligal na droga sa pamamagitan ng pag-engganyo po sa ating mga kabataan na maglaro ng basketball o ng kahit anong larong pampalakasan.\"\n\n\"Get into sports, stay away from drugs.

Kaya nagbibigay po kami ng bola sa inyo para po matuto, makapag-ensayo at gumaling sa larangan ng sports,\" he encouraged.\n\nThe Malasakit Team also gave the beneficiaries snacks, shirts, and masks. The activity was held at the Calbiga Covered Court.\n\nMeanwhile, in coordination with Congressman Michael Tan, Governor Sharee Ann Tan, Vice Governor Arnold Tan, Mayor Red Nacario, and Vice Mayor Eva Larbo, the indigents received financial assistance from the government.\n\nSenator Go authored and co-sponsored Republic Act No. 11470 establishing the National Academy of Sports (NAS). Located in New Clark City, Capas, Tarlac, the NAS is a government-run institution that provides a secondary education integrated with a specialized sports curriculum.\n\nThis curriculum is developed in partnership with the Department of Education and the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), illustrating the Senator's commitment to fostering environments where student-athletes can academically and athletically thrive.\n\nGo has also sponsored and is one of the authors of Senate Bill No. 2514, which aims to institutionalize the Philippine National Games. This bill aims to strengthen an integrated and inclusive national sports program, highlighting the inclusion of para-athletes and the commitment to hold biennial Games for wide-ranging participation across the country.\n\nApart from the assistance, Go, Chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, offered medical aid to those with health issues. He urged the beneficiaries to take advantage of the services provided in the Malasakit Center at Samar Provincial Hospital in Catbalogan City.\n\nA brainchild of Go, the Malasakit Center is a one-stop shop designed to aid poor and indigent patients with hospital expenses by covering various services and fees. The Senator principally authored and sponsored Republic Act No. 11463.\n\nTo date, 163 Malasakit Centers nationwide have helped more than ten million Filipinos nationwide, as the Department of Health reported.\n\n\"Nandito kami para magserbisyo sa inyong lahat.

The Rockies haven't won a series this season and have one split in nine chances.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the losing international series, and the moments that mattered most:\n\nThe Moment:\n\n-- Brenton Doyle's white cleats matched the clean bases of Alfredo Harp Hel\u00fa Stadium but didn't touch one.\n\nHe was rounding third base in the fifth inning and would've been the third run to inch the Rockies within one in the series' first game. Instead, he was called out on appeal after the Astros stepped on third. A replay challenge didn't change the call, and Colorado was left empty-handed, and down 4-2.\n\n\"We challenged because we thought he touched third base,\" manager Bud Black said. \"Brenton thought he touched it -- bad turn of events for us. At that point, it (would've) been 4-3. We have a little momentum.\n\n\"The Astros appealed and got the call. Pretty straightforward, but in our opinion, we thought he hit the bag.\"\n\nIt was part of an Astros run that saw them score 12 unanswered runs after the Rockies' two-run first inning. They scored three in the top of the third before Colorado nearly cut into the lead in the fifth.\n\nTakeaway\n\n-- Alan Trejo had more fans at the game than usual -- 16 total family members -- and soaked in the moment in Mexico City's opener. Hearing both countries' national anthems, similar to his experience in the World Baseball Classic with Mexico, brought the feeling back.\n\n\"Goosebumps,\" Trejo said. \"After both national anthems, it's hard to compare this to the (World Baseball Classic), but there's so much energy here. There's so much culture, and a lot of folks are here to cheer us on and it's a wonderful experience.\n\n\"This is such a full-circle moment.\"\n\nJorge De La Rosa and Vinny Castilla threw out the first pitches in the two-game series, and it was a rare opportunity for Colorado to spread the game to another country. Trejo has family in Mexico and was able to experience a taste of the country his family has called home.\n\nMLB's World Tour will make it to four countries in 2024, and the Rockies were given one of the slots. With more international series in the future, players like Venezuelan Elias D\u00edaz may get a chance in their country. Cal Quantrill got his homecoming in Canada early this month and now Trejo did too.\n\nWhat went right:\n\n-- Ryan McMahon made a first impression with a first-game home run, and his power may be waking up.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nThe third baseman has carried a high average all year but went 15 games without a home run after a hot start. He went deep in back-to-back games to open the team's home schedule and now has two in his last four games after a season-best 459-foot shot in Mexico City.\n\nHis power surges have carried Colorado's offense before. McMahon hit a home run in four consecutive games in 2023 and drove in 11 runs in the same span.\n\nColorado was unable to match his efforts this time.\n\nWhat went wrong:\n\n-- The Astros' Yordan \u00c1lvarez hit two 461-foot home runs in game one and helped ignite a struggling Astros offense.\n\nHe hit the first in the third inning to put Houston ahead after an early, and rare Rockies' lead. Kyle Tucker made it back-to-back shots before \u00c1lvarez added his second homer in the ninth inning to put the finishing touches on a blowout win.\n\n\"I don't think it's a secret to anyone that we were having a tough moment offensively,\" \u00c1lvarez said through a translator. \"When we did introductions, I told the guys, 'Hey, it feels like opening day, like the beginning of the season.'\"\n\nTucker added another in Sunday's game. His second home run in two days and \u00c1lvarez's sacrifice fly gave the Astros a first-inning edge. They added two more home runs in another lopsided final\n\nIn two games, Houston scored 20 runs. It came on the heels of a four-game stretch that saw it score a combined six. The Rockies also played a role in igniting the Phillies' run back to an above-.500 record and have been a get-right series for multiple opposing clubs in 2024.\n\nWhat's up next:\n\n-- Colorado will head to Miami, and it hasn't been a fun trip in recent years for the visiting Rockies.\n\nThey have gone 7-16 since the start of 2015 when traveling to South Beach. It represents a chance for the Rockies to put distance between themselves and the Marlins (6-23) at the bottom of the NL standings. If they struggle again, they'll likely take the cellar spot over.\n\nAstros 8, Rockies 2\n\nWhat happened: Kyle Tucker's home run helped the Astros lead early before Jos\u00e9 Altuve's helped them later on in a second lopsided win over the Rockies in as many days.\n\nOn the mound: Austin Gomber allowed three home runs but limited their damage across seven innings for his longest start this season. He didn't issue a walk but allowed six hits. Jake Bird allowed the final blows. He gave up four earned runs in \u2154 of an inning, issued a pair of walks and hit another batter. Nick Mears helped by allowing inherited runners but officially threw 1\u2153 scoreless innings.\n\nAt the plate: Nolan Jones had a double for Colorado's only extra-base hit and five teammates contributed to its seven-hit total. He exited after the sixth inning for Jake Cave. The Rockies saw Elias D\u00edaz garner two hits but they didn't draw a walk and struck out 11 times.\n\nWhat's next: Colorado Rockies (RHP Ryan Feltner, 1-2) at Miami Marlins (TBA) at 4:40 p.m. on Tuesday at LoanDepot Park (Rockies.TV).", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_zahlmann_luke_zahlmann@gazette.com", "name": "Luke Zahlmann Luke.Zahlmann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/21/0213eac1-fad5-5fd6-b733-43e991672c49/662ede64eaf24.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "eventUri": "eng-9519548", "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 452044531, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657adc"}

You might be familiar with the style because of your dad's workout gear back in the day, aka, when the sneakers were primarily meant for exercise. But now, as \"ugly sneakers\" continue to dominate the market, we're seeing more and more people wearing them out, including famous faces like Kaia Gerber, Hailey Bieber, and Jennifer Garner.\n\nI, for one, couldn't be more pleased by this collective shift toward comfort-first footwear. Hitting 10,000 steps is a big part of my personality, and I could never survive life in New York in a pair of uncomfortable heels. While Taylor Swift might romanticize the 1830s, I'm perfectly content with the decade I was born into -- an era where the same shoes you find at your local running store are also the ones street-style icons wear.\n\nBut here's the thing about Asics sneakers: They're first and foremost functional sports shoes worn by top-tier athletes. They offer styles for a variety of sports, including trail running, pickleball, volleyball, tennis, golf, and even wrestling. But, they don't stop on the courts -- or the field. They're the perfect day-to-night shoe that you can seamlessly transition from sports practice to school to evenings out, all thanks to their versatility.\n\nGorpcore enthusiasts are especially fond of various Asics styles, as most are designed with functional details and muted colors that feel trail and street-style ready. Not to mention, plenty of the options are constructed with comfort in mind, with many sneakers having special gel technology built-in that offers improved shock absorption and ample foot support. All this to say, Asics sneakers are the sneakers you can actually walk miles in -- and you won't want to kick them off at the end of the day.\n\nAsics wearers on the internet agree the shoes are, in fact, superior, with reviews calling them everything from \"gold standard\" of sneakers to the \"best shoes ever.\" Don't let the price scare you away either. One shopper noted, \"I was skeptical of the price until I had them in hand and on foot. Between the super premium materials and A1 comfort, I highly recommend them.\"\n\nAnother thing to note about Asics is that many sneaker models are gender-neutral. The inherently simple design and muted colors that many styles are designed in ensures wearability across the board; plus, you can style them however you please, too. You can wear them with a tennis skirt like Gerber, or take them to the street with baggy sneakers and a cropped white tee like Garner. Either way, you'll look cool, and you'll be comfortable, too.\n\nAscis are certainly blowing up -- and more celebs are bound to step out in the comfy kicks that might just prove to be a fierce Adidas Sambas competitor.

Although I didn't particularly feel lucky when my alarm startled me from slumber at 4:30 a.m. in Los Angeles, nobody lives a more charmed sporting life than me.\n\nYes, the Nuggets fell short Saturday night of sweeping the Lakers out of LeBron James' misery.\n\nLong after the final score of L.A.'s 119-108 victory is forgotten, however, we will be staring in wonder at a masterpiece Jokic painted blindly on the fly.\n\nWhile running full speed upcourt on the fastbreak, Joker gave a where-is-it shrug as a lob pass from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope appeared over his shoulder. But the greatest passer the NBA has ever seen casually slapped the basketball like a mosquito into the waiting hands of Michael Porter Jr. for a dunk. It was Example No. 503 why teammate Aaron Gordon might have understated the truth when he said Joker \"is a genius that just happens to play basketball.\"\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nAfter more than 40 years of chronicling sports in this dusty old cowtown, I might not have learned much, but now understand to never say never, for fear that one of my knuckleheaded takes will be exposed for all eternity.\n\nBut here goes: We have never seen anything like Jokic or Makar wearing the uniform of any sports team in Colorado.\n\nJust don't ask them to reveal the source of their magic, because Jokic and Makar honestly don't know when the sporting gods will touch them next.\n\nWhen asked to explain his mad, 200-foot dash of an unassisted goal in the second period, Makar said: \"In my head, I don't think too much when I do it.\" It's the same way the late great James Brown, the Godfather of Soul. danced on stage. Who needs to think when you're feet just go?\n\nAnd as someone blessed to have borne eyewitness to more than 10,000 games from NFL arenas to Olympic stadiums, I have never witnessed two more mind-bendingly beautiful plays in person on consecutive days in consecutive games than these two Hall of Fame highlights by Joker and Cale.\n\nThey have taken a sandblaster to the Mount Rushmore of Colorado sports. Although in their primes and a long way from finished, as long as you allow me to put Makar and Jokic alongside John Elway as the top three athletes to represent this state, I will leave the fourth player to your discretion.\n\nThe best three defensemen ever to wear NHL sweaters? That's a loaded question. While placing Orr at No. 1 is a truth that's self-evident, I invite argument by selecting six-time champion Doug Harvey of the Canadiens' dynasty at No. 2 and picking Detroit legend Nicklas Lidstrom over Ray Bourque third.\n\nBut given time and health, Makar will crack that top three. And sooner rather than later.\n\nJokic is No. 4 with a bullet on the list of all-time outstanding NBA centers, with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain in his sights.\n\nTwo GOAT-worthy players that work on alternating nights during the playoffs in the same Denver arena at the same time?\n\nThey are twin magicians born an ocean apart on different continents.\n\nAll hail Cale!\n\nAnd long live the Joker!\n\nThey are kings of the new golden age of Colorado sports.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_kiszla_mark_kiszla@gazette.com", "name": "Mark Kiszla Mark.Kiszla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/cd/4cd14cad-2d7f-5e6b-923d-6aa93e345517/662edfdaa16aa.image.jpg?crop=1825%2C958%2C168%2C0&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 452044469, "relevance": 6, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657adf"}

You have a different identity. We graduated some good players,\" Morgan said. \"It's just the natural kind of attrition of personnel leaving that you have to replace, and it may not be the exact same type of player. Maybe you have to change the scheme a little bit here and there, but it's just teaching young guys what we do and getting them in the mix to see whether they can help us as sophomores and juniors.\"\n\n\"It's good for the communities. the people in the communities work together, work with each other, know each other, and work in the refineries. A lot of the kids know each other, play sports outside of football and outside of school sports with them,\" he added about the new additions to their district. \"They compete against them in other sports throughout the season, throughout the year. so it's good. we know a lot of familiar faces and have seen them since middle school, so it's fun for these kids to compete against one another.\"\n\nIt's a next-up mentality that is a gamble that teams like the Port Arthur Memorial Titans have no choice in, and the hopes that the gamble pays off in the fall.\n\n\"We at least got to go past the fourth round this year,\" Roberts said. \"We're just really trying to do whatever we can to get as best as we can and move on forward really.

Our hope is that, moving forward, Nike will take a similar approach.\"\n\nWhile the new uniformed debuted at the 2023 All-Star Game, its rollout this spring led to reams of bad publicity. The shrinking of letter size on players' nameplates gave jerseys an amateur look. The pants -- which, according to the memo, will \"return to the higher quality zipper used in 2023\" -- had myriad issues, including the see-through fabric, a lack of tailoring and blowouts players believed unnecessary.\n\nNike's partnership with MLB began in 2019, when it took over as the league's official uniform supplier as part of a 10-year, $1 billion deal for MLB. Fanatics has partnerships with both the league and the union.\n\n\"We cautioned Nike against various changes when they previewed them in 2022, particularly regarding pants,\" the union memo said. \"MLB had been, and has been, aware of our concerns as well.

The two references to peaches in Challengers may have Guadagnino followers thinking of a different movie, but they are not intentional. Guadanino's 2017 film, Call Me by Your Name, infamously features a peach being \"used\" by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's character, Elio.\n\nSpider-Senses might have been tingling for some theatergoers during Zendaya's new film Challengers this weekend. Specifically, those Marvel and superhero fans in attendance undoubtedly heard Tashi (Zendaya) and Art's (Mike Faist) daughter, Lily, asking to watch the animated Spider-Verse rather than something more from the world of tennis, which consumes her parents' lives. Director Luca Guadagnino admits to suggesting that the superhero Spider-Man should be the young girl's go-to, but the filmmaker didn't realize the meaning that reference would have for fans of Zendaya's involvement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Guadagnino said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly:\n\n\"When you get rights for something to be used in a movie, it's very complicated. Amy Pascal, our amazing producer, was of help there. I said, 'Amy, can we use one of your catalog titles, so it's going to be easier to clear them?' [Lily's] a girl. She's not going to choose to watch The Social Network or The Post, but maybe she's going to watch a Spider-Man cartoon, so I said, 'Why not Spider-Verse?' Now I realize that it sounded like an in-joke, which, you know, the unconscious guides us all the time.\"\n\nChallengers R DramaRomanceSports 4 /5 Release Date April 26, 2024 Director Luca Guadagnino Cast Zendaya Coleman , Josh O'Connor , Mike Faist Writers Justin Kuritzkes Studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Pascal Pictures\n\nWhile Zendaya does not voice any of the characters in Sony's animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, or its sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Universe, the actress is an integral part of Spider-Man's live-action presence in the MCU. Zendaya portrays Peter Parker's (Tom Holland) girlfriend, Michelle Jones-Watson, aka MJ. In addition to the Spider-Verse reference, Guadagnino also addressed the seemingly peachy nods to his 2017 film, Call Me by Your Name in Challengers.\n\nPeachy Nods to Call Me by Your Name?\n\nClose\n\nChallengers reigns as the No. 1 movie this weekend in theaters with an impressive $25-million worldwide debut. And while the steamy sports drama already offers audiences an all-consuming love triangle between Tashi (Zendaya), Art (Faist) and Patrick (Josh O'Connor), there appears to be a couple of Easter Eggs hiding in plain sight for fans of filmmaker Luca Guadagnino's 2017 romance, Call Me by Your Name.\n\nIn Call Me by Your Name, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's character, Elio, infamously pleasures himself sexually with a piece of fruit: a peach. His love interest, Oliver (Armie Hammer) finds him alone soon after and teases Elio by threatening to take a bite out of the now \"used\" peach! So, seeing a peach show up in a Guadagnino film can't help but conjure up images from Call Me by Your Name. But the Challengers director insists that the two -- yes two -- peach scenes in the Zendaya-led romance are not references to the ever-so-peachy Call Me by Your Name. Guadagnino said in another interview with EW:\n\nI think nods never should be gratuitous. But they were a nod because we are in Atlanta, and the symbol of Atlanta is a peach.\n\nRelated Challengers' Steamy Three-Way Kiss Almost Didn't Make the Cut, Cast Addresses the Film's Exhilarating Ending While Challengers' emotional ending is still being debated, the infamous three-way kiss almost didn't even end up in the movie.\n\nThe first sign of the peach in Challengers, which turns out isn't a reference to Guadagnino's best movie, is within a bowl as Art's tennis match looms. Since the movie was being shot in Atlanta, peaches -- the state's official fruit -- seemed like a no-brainer to use as a part of the set design. The second time a peach is spotted comes when Tashi and Art's daughter, Lily, enters carrying a \"furry peach.\" Guadagnino continued:\n\nThe daughter of Tashi and Art, when she comes into the hotel room in Atlanta, she asks for the attention of the mother. And she comes into the room holding a furry peach.\n\nWhether or not these references were intended or not, they're just peachy keen. At the end of the day, nods or not, Challengers is the No. 1 movie in the world. And Luca Guadagnino is enjoying the biggest opening weekend of his illustrious career.\n\nChallengers is now playing exclusively in theaters.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_thrash@movieweb.com", "name": "Steven Thrash", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/spider-man-no-way-home-zendaya.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9519834", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 452044402, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ae7"}

They were much more dominant than the score indicates, with 27 high-danger chances to the Knights' four. If not for Vegas goalie Logan Thompson's 43 saves, the Stars would've sealed the victory long before the end of regulation.\n\n\"It's not just winning, it's as important how you win,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"I think we were building towards that game (in) parts of Game 1, larger parts of Game 2. I thought we got a complete effort. Obviously, they were off a little bit and that helped. You know they're going to fix that, but I think we're getting an idea of how we have to play in this series in order to have success.\"\n\nBoth coaches gave their players a break Sunday.

The Stars, knowing what was at stake, came out flying.\n\n\"We knew that was a must win,\" DeBoer said. \"I think we have the same desperation level. I think when you play a game like that, you feel this is a new series now.\"\n\nThe displeased look on Cassidy's face when he met with the media Sunday told the story of the feelings on the other side.\n\nVegas had a chance to take full control - only four teams have rallied to win a series after being down 3-0. But the Stars have a chance to mimic what the New Jersey Devils accomplished just last season, dropping their first two games at home before rallying to beat the New York Rangers in seven games.\n\nThe Knights, having missed their opportunity to all but wrap up this series, have another chance Monday to put the Stars on the brink of elimination.\n\n\"We weren't prepared to play,\" Cassidy said. \"I've said many times it's a coach's job to do that with the gameplan, which needed to be better. But the individual has to prepare to win his races and battles. So let's make sure we correct that for tomorrow and put this one behind us, but understand what we're up against here.\"\n\nLIGHTNING at PANTHERS, Panthers lead 3-1, 7 p.m. EDT (ESPN)\n\nThe Panthers get a chance to win a series at home for what would be only the fourth time in franchise history. Florida ousted Boston and Philadelphia on home ice in Rounds 1 and 2 of the 1996 playoffs, then eliminated Carolina at home in last season\u00b4s Eastern Conference finals.\n\nAnd even though the Panthers let a chance to sweep slip away by losing Game 4 in Tampa, coach Paul Maurice said the mood in his locker room isn\u00b4t changing much.\n\n\"We did what we needed to do at home; we won the first two games. And then we did what we needed to do on the road; we split,\" Maurice said. \"Man, you want to win that fourth one, but it\u00b4s a pretty good team over there and they don\u00b4t want to lose that fourth one.\"\n\nThe Lightning still have a steep hill to climb as only four teams (in 206 tries) has rebounded from a 3-0 deficit to win a series.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing for us is our emotions,\" coach Jon Cooper said. \"It\u00b4s a been a series of ebbs and flows. There\u00b4s times when they\u00b4re kind of all over us, and I feel like there are some times we\u00b4re all over them. So, it\u00b4s how each team handles those. When we\u00b4re emotionally engaged, as we definitely were (Saturday night), that\u00b4s a good thing for us.\"\n\nCaptain Steven Stamkos scored two goals and defenseman Mikhail Sergachev returned from a broken left leg that had sidelined him since early February.\n\n\"It makes us bigger, stronger, heavier, more of a threat,\" Cooper said of Sergachev. \"He is a positive impact on our team.

Marner even took off his gloves at one point and threw them down.\n\n\"That happens when things aren\u00b4t going well,\" Keefe said Sunday at the Leafs\u00b4 practice facility following a team meeting. \"In the past, quite honestly, that wouldn\u00b4t have happened.

That means schools that separate boys' and girls' locker rooms, bathrooms, and sports teams (more on that in a moment) teams will potentially lose their funding.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to universities, where the students are adults, but all the way down into the K-12 system, forcing minor girls to have to share any previously single-sex facility with biological males.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it intends to carve out sports for a separate rulemaking later on - read: after the election - but this is the most transparent of political fig leaves. The plain language of the rule tells schools that treating a boy as a boy is forbidden.\n\nAnd while Biden officials claim to have separated out sports for special treatment, likely because of the popularity of state laws ensuring fair single-sex competition in their tracks and pools, the administration has already behaved the exact opposite in federal court.\n\nThe federal government filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit asserting explicitly that West Virginia's state law keeping women's sports female-only is a violation of Title IX.\n\nIf nothing is done to reverse these changes to Title IX, either by successful challenges in court or through Congress and the democratic process, telling Lia Thomas he must compete against his fellow men will likely be \"illegal\" when these regulations go into effect on Aug. 1.\n\nEven worse, schools will have an obligation to punish what federal law will now consider illegal discrimination, which means that any brave girls who speak out or refuse to compete with biological males will be potentially subject to sanction, lest the school lose federal funding.\n\nBut twisting a women's rights statute into a weapon to take away girls' privacy, opportunities, and safety isn't even the end of the new Title IX changes. The rule also reverses due process protections for college students put in place by the Trump administration, ensuring procedural fairness guarantees like the right to an unbiased adjudicator, the right to know the specifics of what you're accused of committing, and the right to representation.\n\nHundreds of young men have vindicated these basic due process rights in federal courts, but the Biden administration is now greenlighting a return to kangaroo courts on campus for those accused of sexual misconduct. It's worth pointing out that Joe Biden himself did not submit to the kind of Star Chamber hearing he's demanding for college students when accused of sexual assault by Tara Reade.\n\nFinally, the new regulations also make worrying incursions into what courts have clearly defined as protected speech. First, because the rule defines treating someone as the sex they actually are as discrimination, it potentially encourages schools to punish even minor students who \"misgender\" a fellow. Second, the rule returns to an unconstitutionally vague Obama-era definition of what constitutes \"harassment,\" opening the door to sweep in all kinds of subjectively offensive speech.\n\nEach of these changes alone would constitute a five-alarm fire. Put them together and you have a massive regulatory overreach affecting the lives and constitutional rights of millions of Americans.\n\nAll this from a statute that merely bans discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in educational institutions that take federal funds. The executive branch and unelected bureaucrats do not have the power to singlehandedly rewrite civil rights law, and turn the plain meaning of Title IX on its head, eliminating protections for both women's and men's rights with the stroke of a pen.\n\nFortunately, the current Supreme Court has been more skeptical of this very kind of uncontrolled agency power, which circumvents the democratic process and separation of powers. Independent Women's Law Center is proud to be one of the many organizations that will no doubt challenge these unconstitutional regulations, and states like Louisiana and Florida have already announced that they will not be complying, launching their own cases in court.\n\nUltimately, though, what can be done by the \"pen and the phone\" can be undone the same way by a new chief executive, or Congress can exercise its powers under the Congressional Review Act to reverse these regulations.\n\nIn the meantime, the ability of women and girls to safely participate in their educations, and the constitutional rights of students, teachers, and professors alike, hang in the balance as we get closer to the election in November.\n\nInez Stepman is a senior policy analyst at Independent Women's Forum (iwf.org) and the host of High Noon podcast.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-9521113", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 452044326, "relevance": 4, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aea"}

Other line items such as taxes, administrative fees, equipment fees, franchise fees, and fees for public, educational, and governmental (PEG) channels are not required to be part of the all-in price.\n\nThe FCC's action represents the latest iteration of the Biden administration's broader \"whole of government\" attack on what it views as \"junk fees\" and opaque pricing. The rule was significantly controversial, drawing concerns from industry stakeholders that the rule could potentially distort competition, as well as the two dissenting FCC Republican commissioners.\n\nUnder the new rules, if a customer receives a promotional price, the bill must show either the length of time for the promotion or the specific date it will end, and billing statements 60 days and 30 days before the end of the promotional period must include the post-promotion all-in price that applies after the expiration of the promotion. All promotional materials that offer a promotional or introductory rate must also disclose the time period of the promotion or the date when the promotional rate will end, in addition to the all-in price after the promotion ends.\n\nIf the all-in price varies by location, providers may advertise a starting price or a range of prices, but that range must include the highest all-in price that could apply. Providers must then disclose in the advertising or marketing where and how customers may obtain the actual all-in price for their service area. When a potential customer then contacts the provider and provides an actual location, the provider must then be prepared to supply the all-in price for that location.\n\nThe rule does not take effect immediately, but providers will be required to comply with the new rules either by December 19, 2024, or by the date when the Office of Management and Budget completes its review, whichever is later. Providers that have less than $47 million in annual receipts are given a slightly longer period to bring their marketing into compliance, and have until March 19, 2025, or until OMB approval, whichever is later.\n\nOriginally published by Venable LLP", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/Mondaq_Share.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 452044283, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aeb"}

Weeks of winter storms have badly eroded beaches in the northern section of town, leaving little if any sand on which to play during all but the lowest tides.\n\nExecutives with the three northernmost casinos - the Ocean Casino Resort, Resorts and Hard Rock - are pressing the federal and state governments to expedite a beach replenishment project that was supposed to have been done last year.\n\nBut under the current best-case scenario, new sand won't be hitting the beaches until late summer, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers, the agency that oversees such projects.\n\nAnd that has the casinos concerned about not having an essential element of their tourism appeal. Atlantic City has long said its beaches set it apart from the plentiful gambling options elsewhere in the region and the country. Without them, it could be a harder sell in attracting tourists and gamblers.\n\n\"One of the highlights of coming to Atlantic City has always been the beaches and the Boardwalk,\" said Mike Sampson, general manager of the Hard Rock casino. \"It's going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHard Rock lost its popular beach bar to repeated winter storms.\n\n\"It was totally destroyed,\" Sampson said. \"Parts of it washed out to sea; debris remained on the beach and had to be disposed of.\"\n\nHe said Hard Rock is hopeful it can still rent out beach cabanas and umbrellas this summer, albeit on a smaller beach.\n\nSampson said that \"unless someone can intervene, it's probably going to be a post-summer fill\".\n\nAnything that might make people less likely to come to Atlantic City is bad news for the gambling resort, which still has not recovered from the Covid-19 outbreak. Only three of the nine casinos are winning more money from in-person gamblers than they did in 2019 before the pandemic hit.\n\nA load of sand is dumped on the beach in front of the Ocean Casino Resort in May last year. -- AP\n\nAnd while internet gambling and sports betting has added new revenue streams to the equation, that money must be shared with partners such as tech platforms and sports books, and is not solely for the casinos to keep. That is why the casinos consider money won from in-person gamblers to be their core business - and why they need usable beaches.\n\nLast summer, the Ocean Casino spent US$600,000 to truck in and dump sand on its beach, which was not in as bad a shape as it is this year.\n\n\"How do you run a beach resort without a beach?\" asked Bill Callahan, Ocean's general manager. \"It's a tough pill to swallow.\"\n\nAnd an expensive one: that sand quickly washed away, and even less is left there now. At high tide, the ocean waves lap up against the dune, which itself is badly eroded.\n\n\"By the end of summer, all that sand was gone,\" said Ian Jerome, project director for Ocean's effort last year. \"That is not a sustainable option.\"\n\nOf the dozen beach entrances spanning the three casinos, only two are accessible, he said. The rest are just dead-end in mid-air, with treacherous drop-offs that could cause serious injury - or worse - should anyone fall from them.\n\nAtlantic City last received beach replenishment in 2020, and was due for additional sand last summer. But Congress failed to approve funding for the project then.\n\nThis year, US$25mil in federal funding is available toward the US$30mil cost, of which the state pays a smaller percentage.\n\nBut the government contracting process does not lend itself to quick fixes.\n\nStephen Rochette, a spokesman for the Army Corps, said a contract for the work will be put out to bid soon, with the work starting \"sometime this summer or in the fall\".\n\nHe said the agency is aware of the tendency of Atlantic City's northern beaches to erode at a more rapid rate than other ones, and is studying the situation to see if any engineering improvements can be added to the eventual project design.\n\nMark Giannantonio, president of Resorts casino and of the Casino Association of New Jersey, said the casinos want at least some of the project to be carried out in early summer - what he called a possible \"beach-lite\" option.\n\n\"Everyone realises the importance of getting this sand,\" he said. \"The sense of urgency is real.\" -- AP", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/04/29/2666849.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 452044273, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aec"}

By\n\nAFP-Relaxnews Published\n\nApr 29, 2024\n\nDonning hijabs and floor-length abaya gowns over shorts and tank tops, Chinese students at an e-commerce school perform into a smartphone camera as they learn how to sell the clothes to overseas TikTok users.\n\nIt is the final day of a two-week course on selling products abroad via the short video app -- which despite being blocked in China is a platform more and more Chinese vendors are turning to.\n\nSucceeding on TikTok requires tools for bypassing internet restrictions as well as foreign-language skills, challenges that have prompted a boom in courses and consulting services.\n\nAt the school in Guangzhou in southern Guangdong province, an instructor holds up the Middle Eastern-inspired garments to the camera and rattles off prices and sizing information for Muslim buyers in the UK.\n\n\"This is chiffon, it's really breathable!\" she gushes in English as her proteges model the goods and sort through racks of satin robes under stark studio lights.\n\n\"We teach people which products are selling better, and which markets are more suitable for their current stages,\" 27-year-old Wang Yaxuan, another instructor at the school, tells AFP.\n\nGuangdong is home to thousands of factories making a mindboggling variety of products, from the abayas to espresso machine parts to wigs made of human hair.\n\nAfter decades of producing goods for export, Chinese companies are increasingly seeking to cut out the middleman and market themselves at lower prices, directly to overseas consumers.\n\nShein, the China-founded fast fashion giant, has effectively taken over the lower-end Western market using this strategy, with TikTok a key facet of its selling network.\n\nTikTok Shop launched in the United States late last year, and e-commerce features have previously been rolled out in places like Britain and Southeast Asia.\n\nA casual scroll on the hugely popular app's \"Live\" tab can land users on multiple shopping livestreams within minutes.\n\nBut with TikTok unavailable in China -- parent company Bytedance operates the more strictly censored sister app Douyin domestically -- smaller businesses there are at a disadvantage.\n\nCourses like the one at Mede Education Technology's e-commerce school help by covering everything from the basics of creating a TikTok account to handling shipping and analysing sales data.\n\nFees start at around 9,000 yuan ($1,244) for a six-day course.\n\nStudents, who range from factory owners to fresh graduates, often take classes for multiple foreign shopping platforms including Amazon and Southeast Asia's Shopee.\n\nInformation gap\n\nQiu Zhouwen, a course participant in his 30s, works for a Guangzhou cosmetics company.\n\nHe says his company enrolled him because they are hoping to eventually sell their skincare range through TikTok.\n\n\"Information is part of the cost (of doing business) now, and if you don't have the information that's appropriate to the market, your cost will be way too high,\" Qiu says.\n\nWang, the Mede instructor, attended university in the United States and says it can be challenging for Chinese sellers to adapt to different consumer tastes abroad.\n\nChemical manufacturer Donghua Jinlong spawned viral memes on TikTok this month after overseas social media users found absurdist humour in the company's matter-of-fact videos about industrial-grade glycine featuring AI-generated voiceovers.\n\nThere are also significant technical hurdles.\n\nAccessing TikTok from China requires VPN software to bypass the country's virtual \"Great Firewall\", while dodging the app's own curbs on users manipulating their IP addresses.\n\nVPNs are a legal grey area in China, with authorities occasionally cracking down while generally tolerating their use for business purposes.\n\nTikTok is also caught up in global geopolitical tensions -- the US Congress is threatening to ban the app entirely over concerns it could share personal data with the Chinese government.\n\nWang is unfazed by the prospect of a US TikTok ban.\n\n\"Our students are not just selling to the US market... the current trend for TikTok for Southeast Asia is also very good,\" she tells AFP.\n\nWang says it's not the first time this situation has happened, adding that she feels the United States was trying to \"take this huge cake and split up the market\".\n\nCatchphrases and clicks\n\nMede is one of many organisations running TikTok classes, including others based in Guangdong, where authorities have hung up propaganda banners promoting international e-commerce.\n\nThose not willing to shell out steep course fees can also seek advice from e-commerce veterans who have built a following on Chinese social apps by sharing TikTok tips.\n\nMolly Zhao, a 23-year-old TikTok livestreamer, has been selling products including clothing and electronics online since 2022.\n\nZhao, who studied in Italy and speaks Italian and English, told AFP her foreign-language skills have earned her livestreaming jobs paying as much as 20,000 yuan ($2,760) each month.\n\nShe regularly posts videos for domestic viewers on Douyin, covering topics including common English phrases and how to explain shipping rates clearly.\n\n\"You must build up the atmosphere,\" she explains in one video, adding that using a catchphrase can \"make a deeper impression on customers\".\n\nIn another video, a smiling, dancing Zhao shares her warmup routine before a livestream session selling gemstones and crystals to US viewers.\n\n\"Time to earn Americans' money,\" she says in a deadpan caption. \"I'll put on some music to hype myself up.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 AFP-Relaxnews.

As a Dotdash fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nCalled-Up Share Capital vs. Paid-Up Share Capital: an Overview\n\nThe difference between called-up share capital and paid-up share capital is that investors have already paid in full for paid-up capital. Called-up capital has not yet been completely paid, though payment has been requested by the issuing entity.\n\nShare capital consists of all funds raised by a company in exchange for shares of either common or preferred stock. The amount of share capital or equity financing a company has can change over time. A company that plans to raise more equity and be approved to issue additional shares thereby increases its share capital.\n\nCalled-Up Share Capital\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction and the business in question, some companies may issue shares to investors with the understanding they will be paid at a later date. This allows for more flexible investment terms and may entice investors to contribute more share capital than if they had to provide funds upfront. The amount of share capital shareholders owe, but have not paid, is referred to as called-up capital.\n\nShare capital consists of all funds raised by a company in exchange for shares of either common or preferred shares of stock. The amount of share capital or equity financing a company has can change over time. A company that wishes to raise more equity can obtain authorization to issue and sell additional shares, thereby increasing its share capital.\n\nShare capital is only generated by the initial sale of shares by the company to investors, e.g. via an IPO. It does not include shares being sold in a secondary market after they've been issued.\n\nPaid-Up Share Capital\n\nAny amount of money that has already been paid by investors in exchange for shares of stock is paid-up capital. Even if an investor has not paid in full, the amount already remitted is included as paid-up capital. All paid-up capital is listed under the shareholders' equity section of the issuing company's balance sheet.\n\nPaid-up capital represents money that is not borrowed. A company that is fully paid-up has sold all available shares and thus cannot increase its capital unless it borrows money by taking on debt. A company could, however, receive authorization to sell more shares.\n\nA company's paid-up capital figure thus represents the extent to which it depends on equity financing to fund its operations. This figure can be compared with the company's level of debt to assess if it has a healthy balance of financing, given its operations, business model, and prevailing industry standards.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nIn addition to called-up share capital and paid-up share capital, share capital can fall into two other categories: authorized share capital and issued share capital.\n\nAuthorized Share Capital\n\nTo sell stock to the public, a business must first register with a governing body. Part of this registration includes documentation of the amount of capital the business is looking to generate through selling stock. This amount is called its authorized capital and is the maximum amount that can be raised in this manner.\n\nIssued Share Capital\n\nOut of the maximum amount of authorized share capital, the value of shares the company actually issues is called issued share capital. The amount of issued share capital is generally much lower than the authorized share capital, so the business has the opportunity to issue additional shares later.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christina_majaski@investopedia.com", "name": "Christina Majaski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/8MXsqUKNDbX6mEUy7KGILOrZfVI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/INV_Nasdaq_ETFs_GettyImages-1469731407-8859c00ac2d24dc5879b5ecdcf52a37c.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 452044744, "relevance": 5, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657aef"}

Others are UPDC, Notore Chemical, PZ Cussons, International Breweries and Livestock Feeds.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, four out of the 15 companies declared a combined total dividend of close to N400 billion to shareholders. For instance, MTN Nigeria paid a total of N317.5 billion in dividends, culminating in N5.60 kobo while Dangote Sugar declared N18.32 billion in dividends translating to N1.50 kobo per share within the period.\n\nShareholders of Nestle received N46.75 billion total dividend, translating to N61.50 kobo. Nigerian Breweries declared N13.87 billion dividend, amounting to N1.43 kobo within the period.\n\nHowever, the harsh economic reality has severely impacted their performance, causing them to post huge losses in their 2023 operations. For some of the companies, the losses were majorly due to foreign exchange loans they took from their parent companies or international sources while others were overwhelmed with the prolonged uncertainty in the nation's business environment.\n\nUnfortunately, a good number of shareholders have invested huge amounts of money, even their life savings in these firms due to their track records of good corporate governance and dividend policy.\n\nAlthough some analysts argued that while it may be disappointing to investors seeking short-term returns, it could also mean prudent financial management and strategic planning by these companies, potentially leading to increased investment in innovation, expansion, or sustainability initiatives, which, in the long run, could ultimately benefit the economy.\n\nHowever shareholders insisted that the losses have caused excruciating pain to them as it has further reduced their purchasing power and exposed them to more hardship.\n\nIn addition, the shareholders expressed doubt about the sustainability of their investment in these firms and the continuity of some of the companies in the Nigerian market.\n\nA Research Analyst at Cowry Asset Management Limited, Charles Abuede said the decision by listed corporates not to pay dividends to shareholders in the 2023 financial year may be hinged on various factors such as financial constraints, reinvestment opportunities for future growth, or strategic shifts in business priorities.\n\nHe pointed out that the trend may indicate caution for the market in the face of economic uncertainty, which has compelled many listed firms to preserve cash reserves and focus on long-term growth strategies rather than short-term returns for shareholders.\n\nAbuede added that the trend could also impact the confidence of investors and consumer spending, especially for shareholders who rely on dividends as a source of income.\n\nCo-founder of Noble Shareholders Association of Nigeria, Gbadebo Olatokunbo said there is a need for government to review its policies on local sourcing and backward integration.\n\nAccording to him, many indigenous firms that have been in operation for over 50 years still source 80 per cent of their raw materials outside the country.\n\n\"Findings have indicated that many companies that were about 50 years in Nigeria still rely on foreign raw materials, which is not good for our economy. We implore MAN to start talking to their members on the importance of backward integration and demerits of over-dependence on foreign materials.\"\n\nA look at the 2023 financial performance of these quoted companies showed that PZ Cussons, for the year ended November 2023, recorded a loss after-tax of N74.1 billion from a profit of N7.7 billion achieved in the corresponding period in the same period in 2022.\n\nSimilarly, Fertiliser and agro-allied company, Notore Chemical Industries posted a group loss after tax (LAT) of N114.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, against a loss of N7.1 billion posted in the previous year.\n\nThis is even as the company's revenue decreased to N21.55 billion from N32.3 billion in 2022 financial year. For International Breweries Plc, its 2023 result showed N70.03 billion loss from N21.63 billion loss declared in 2022.\n\nThe brewery company also announced N97.27 billion loss before tax in 2023 financial year from N266.84 billion loss before tax reported in 2022. The brewery company losses are on the backdrop of N55.98 billion net foreign exchange loss incurred in 2023 up from N5.11 billion net foreign exchange losses suffered in 2022.\n\nIn the same vein, Nestle recorded a loss before tax of N104 billion in its 2023 financial year, against profit before tax of N71 billion posted in the corresponding period in 2022.\n\nThe firm incurred a foreign exchange loss of N195 billion which was the major reason for the loss position. In addition, MTN recorded a loss after tax of N137 billion. The company said the loss has resulted in the depletion of its retained earnings and shareholders fund to negative N208.0 billion and N40.8 billion respectively.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/investors-640x360.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 452044700, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657af0"}

As a 5k monitor, it blows a lot of other monitors out of the water, although it does come with a deep price tag, so if you're the sort of creative pro that's looking to up their game, you'll likely want to grab yourself a good monitor deal. Lukcily, you can get some good discounts on the Apple Studio Display, depending on which model your looking for, and if you're thinking of pairing this with a new Apple computer, check out some of these Apple deals as well.\n\nThe Apple Studio Display is one of the more premium monitors on the market. It's not to be confused with the Apple Pro Display XDR, which is Apple's professional, high end monitor. And while the Apple Studio Display and Pro Display XDR have some similarities, the Studio Display comes in at a much lower price tag. It has a 27-inch screen that comes with 5K resolution and 600 nits of brightness, as well as support for one billion colors and the P3 wide color gamut. It also has a six-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio, which makes it a great place to sit down and watch movie.\n\nBuy Now\n\nIf you're in the market for an Apple Studio Display you may also be interested in the version with Nano-Texture Glass. It has all of the great features you'll find in the entry-level model, but it has an upgraded display construction. While standard glass has an anti-reflective coating for viewing comfort and readability, nano-texture glass drastically reduces glare yet avoids the frostiness and muted colors you'll often find in cheaper screens with a matte display. This is a good way to go if you work in bright spaces or otherwise deal with lots of glare while you work.\n\nBuy Now\n\nApple is very well-known for making some of the best devices for creatives out there, such as the MacBook Pro, which a lot of people rely on for graphical editing and rendering, as well as a plethora of other creative tasks. As such, it's probably no surprise that the Studio Display comes highly recommended, especially if color fidelity and resolution are both important to you. Of course, it does come at a steep price, which is indicative of it being targeted to professionals in the industry rather than your average consumer.\n\nThat said, it's hard to beat the Apple Studio Display in terms of quality, so it makes sense that, even as a freelancer, you might start eyeing them as an option. Luckily, there are a few good deals, as mentioned above, that bring them down to a more palatable level, especially if you go for the lower-end option that is just standard glass that's tilt-adjustable without any add-ons. There is also the matte version, which helps avoid issues with the reflection that you'd find on the standard display, and even though that tends to cause issues with contrast, Apple has found a solid workaround to make it look normal.\n\nAs for whether you should grab one, that depends on where you are in terms of your career and if you feel that you've hit a limit with what you can do with your current screen. It's also a good option if you own a small and medium business and are looking at monitors, as it's a good investment in doing higher-quality work. Otherwise, you might want to go for something that is similar but a bit cheaper, such as the LG 5k Ultrafine monitor, which also has some excellent specs and is significantly cheaper.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/digital_trends_973/f31413805e51fad6ab6167442b363e51", "eventUri": "eng-9522802", "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 452044699, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657af1"}

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Vulcan Steel Limited (ASX:VSL).\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vulcan Steel is:\n\n35% = NZ$60m \u00f7 NZ$169m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every A$1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn A$0.35 in profit.\n\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Vulcan Steel has a higher ROE than the average (10%) in the Metals and Mining industry.\n\nThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Vulcan Steel.\n\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\n\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Vulcan Steel, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.78. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\n\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\n\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\n\nOf course Vulcan Steel may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This speculation comes at a time when Turks suspect U.S. involvement in the coup and when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has accused the West of supporting the coup. It also coincides with exhortations by commentators for the West to rethink, reassess or cut ties with Ankara. Such accusations and rhetoric call the future of Turkish-Western relations into question.\n\nWithin the field of international relations, realists assume that conflicts and alliances between states are determined and shaped by material measures of power, including geostrategic location, geographic depth, population size, economic vigor and military technology. Liberals, on the other hand, believe that inter-state relations are influenced by value-based or normative considerations, such as the extent that governments are democratic or authoritarian, and respect and uphold international institutions, laws, norms and values.\n\nAmid recent tensions before and after the failed coup, Turkish-Western relations have become strained over the liberals' value-based concerns. However, these relations will likely remain intact for the foreseeable future due to the realists' material factors in the geopolitical, military and economic realms.\n\nSince the failed coup attempt, Turkey and the West have squabbled over normative issues. The Turkish government has demanded that the United States extradite the Turkish cleric, Fethullah G\u00fclen, who has been living on his Pennsylvania estate in self-imposed exile since 1999. While secular officers may have led the coup, Ankara insists that G\u00fclen stand trial for allegedly staging and orchestrating a coup that threatened to illegally and unconstitutionally overthrow a democratically elected government. In the process, the Turkish government has been unable to understand why the democratic West would deny such a request.\n\nBefore agreeing to extradite G\u00fclen, the United States has demanded that Ankara comply with the principles of due process and the rule of law by submitting concrete evidence that corroborates his guilt or complicity in the coup. In the meantime, the United States and EU have condemned the post-coup purges and alleged torture that have taken place against thousands of suspected G\u00fclen sympathizers and followers in the government, bureaucracy, military, police, judiciary, media and academia -- the so-called parallel state. The EU has also censured the temporary suspension of the European Convention on Human Rights by the Turkish government so it could declare a three-month state of emergency and potentially impose the death penalty against suspected coup plotters and participants.\n\nPrior to the coup, Turkish-Western tensions had already surfaced and intensified over Ankara's authoritarian tendencies, including its repression of the Gezi Park protests and Erdo\u011fan's implicit designs to amend the constitution, change the political system to a presidential one, and concentrate executive powers into his hands. These designs are predicated on the AKP's ability to secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority in future elections. Western nations and international organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have intensely scrutinized and maintained high expectations and standards for Turkey -- a country that exceptionally established one of the Middle East's first pluralist, parliamentary democracies in 1950, joined NATO and the Baghdad Pact or CENTO in the 1950s and has sought EU accession since 1987.\n\nWhile value-based issues have tested and strained Turkish-Western relations, the probability of their demise is mitigated by material factors in the geopolitical, military, and economic domains. Geopolitically and militarily, the normative tensions that emerged between Turkey and the West have prompted commentators to propose expelling Turkey from NATO. This proposal had previously been raised after Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet and refrained from combatting ISIS in Syria. Following the failed coup, Ankara will have to convince NATO that it can restore military order and remain a reliable partner in multilateral operations. Nevertheless, Turkey's expulsion from NATO would damage the latter's reputation and integrity.\n\nTurkey's expulsion from NATO would also push Turkey toward one of its largest trading partners, Russia -- even if tensions between both countries over the fate and future of Syria will persist. Turkish-Russian rapprochement -- which had already been occurring before the coup -- would defeat the original purpose of NATO and the Baghdad Pact/CENTO of using Turkey as a buffer state against Soviet or Russian intervention in the Middle East. Expulsion from NATO would eliminate the benefits and privileges that Turkey receives as the Middle East's only member nation including hardware, equipment, technology, training, expertise, professionalization, coordination, intelligence, security and prestige.\n\nHistorical considerations aside, Turkey and the West currently and mutually benefit from their NATO alliance. To alleviate socioeconomic pressures and security concerns, the EU has increasingly counted on Turkey and signed a controversial and tenuous agreement with it to stem the flow of millions of Syrian refugees, especially with mounting terrorist attacks on European soil. The United States and the EU depend on access to Turkish airspace to conduct airstrikes and other operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. After the coup, Turkey temporarily closed the Incirlik military base and suspended operations there to likely get its military house in order, but also to send a message to the West regarding the repercussions of supporting the coup, condemning the government's response or refusing to meet its demands.\n\nDespite Turkey's dubious relationship with ISIS as a counterweight against the Kurds, Ankara recognizes the importance of maintaining and intensifying the fight against it after recent suicide attacks on the Istanbul airport and other local targets. After failing to become a model of Islamist democracy in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring and antagonizing regional allies with interventionist policies, Turkey cannot afford further isolation by distancing itself from its traditional allies in NATO. Ankara's real and perceived vulnerability after the coup renders cooperation and rapprochement with these allies an imperative.\n\nEconomically, the stakes of straining and rupturing Turkish-Western relations are equally high. Alongside Iraq, Iran, the UAE, Russia, China and South Korea, the EU and United States represent Turkey's top trading partners. Since entering into a customs union with Ankara in 1995, the EU has become Turkey's largest import-export market for machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods and chemical products. The relationship is bidirectional in that Turkey respectively comprises the seventh and fifth largest market for European imports and exports in similar sectors with steady flows of FDI on both sides. Even if Turkey's suspension of the European Convention on Human Rights sets back the EU accession process -- which had already been called into question given its lengthy duration and the affirmative vote on Brexit -- economic integration has already materialized and become a reality.\n\nWhile less prominent than the EU, the United States still represents an important trading partner. Bilateral trade between the United States and Turkey has increased significantly since Erdo\u011fan first came to power in 2003. Between 2010 and 2013, U.S. exports to Turkey more than doubled and included oil, iron, steel, aircraft, machinery, yarn, fabric and agriculture. In 2013, the United States began FTA negotiations with Turkey, and in 2015, accounted for $6.4 billion or 4.5 percents of its total exports, including vehicles, machinery, iron, steel, stone, plaster, cement and agriculture. Behind Germany, the United States constituted the largest market for Turkish exports in 2016.\n\nAs with the EU and Turkey, the United States and Turkey benefit from bidirectional FDI, even if the U.S. sum is approximately ten times greater. Without possessing the oil and natural gas reserves of its neighbors, Turkey relies on outside investment to bolster manufacturing and services. To maintain or boost its credit rating after recent terrorist attacks and the failed coup, Ankara will have to delicately balance the competing priorities of reestablishing stability and security with preserving transparency and the rule of law.\n\nTo protect or safeguard its legitimacy and longevity, the Turkish government will likely continue to demand G\u00fclen's extradition and subject suspected traitors and opponents to draconian measures -- which ultimately may further destabilize Turkey and the wider region. Particularly in an election year, the United States and its European allies will condemn these measures and contemplate punitive responses. Yet, given the United States and EU's authoritarian allies and unsavory bedfellows in the Middle East, such condemnations and threats will carry little credibility. In the end, contentious statements surrounding value-based issues will cause the Turkish-Western relationship to bend. Yet, material factors related to geopolitics, militaries and economics -- combined with the institutional momentum and inertia of historical alliances -- will prevent it from breaking.\n\nIf Egypt is any indicator, the West's relationship with Turkey will persevere. After Egypt's successful military coup in 2013 and the widespread repression that has followed, the United States and EU momentarily withheld or considered withholding military aid and financial assistance, but returned to business as usual given Camp David's enduring legacy and Cairo's geostrategic value. During this period of dramatic turmoil in the Middle East with a preponderance of failing states and formidable nonstate actors, the West will likely continue to favor stability over democracy -- even if a deficit in the latter polarizes, antagonizes and radicalizes the region's citizens.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/turkey_4.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452044560, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657af8"}

New residents continue to flock to residential developments downtown, and businesses occupy early-20th-century architectural gems that sprouted when the city was at its industrial zenith.\n\nSo, just how did this Midwestern city become a model for urban reinvention?\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, downtown Detroit was a visible reminder of the \"urban doom loop,\" when residents head for the exits and office towers empty out -- leading to diminishing tax revenues that threaten core municipal services.\n\nThe legendary flagship location of Hudson's department store, beloved by generations of Detroiters, closed in 1983. The 1980s saw scores of layoffs in the automobile industry and the closing of numerous factories, causing economic strain in a region once known for its prosperity and its gateway to the middle class. Many small businesses either closed up shop or moved to the region's suburbs, a trend that continued into the 1990s.\n\nBut when the city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in July 2013, the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history, many wondered whether an economic comeback would ever be fully realized. At the time, even weekly trash pickup had become unreliable in many neighborhoods.\n\nNow, the city is seemingly in its best economic position in decades.\n\nDetroit beat out Miami as the fastest-appreciating housing market in the country last November, with home prices rising by 8.7% year-over-year, according to a CoreLogic report.\n\nThe allure of walkable neighborhoods, public transportation, green spaces, and businesses catering to local needs is something that many millennials and Gen Zs have embraced with open arms -- but it's also a quality attractive to many boomers headed into retirement.\n\nDowntown Detroit has an abundance of towering, historic buildings that are perfect for office-to-housing conversions and office renovations that have taken hold in downtowns across the country.\n\nDan Gilbert, the cofounder of Rocket Mortgage (formerly Quicken Loans) and a Detroit native, has poured billions into the city's downtown to revitalize the area.\n\nGilbert's real-estate firm, Bedrock Detroit, is building a 45-story mixed-use skyscraper at the site of the old Hudson's department store. When completed, the development will be home to General Motors' new global headquarters, a five-star hotel, and high-rise residences.\n\nGM is currently headquartered at the 1970s-era Renaissance Center, a Detroit icon. While the company's move from the Renaissance Center has certainly raised questions about the complex's future, GM is staying in the city.

During the 2016 primary, Trump mocked the appearance of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's wife. Trump also helped spread a false story that Cruz's father passed out Fidel Castro pamphlets with Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed President John F. Kennedy.\n\nTrump also mocked another former primary rival, making jokes about former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's weight. Christie also came around to endorsing Trump after bowing out.\n\nChristie, who ran again in the 2024 presidential campaign, changed his tune this cycle and refused to endorse Trump after dropping out once again in January.\n\nAnd when vocal Trump critic and former US Attorney General Bill Barr endorsed Trump for the 2024 ticket, he responded by mocking Barr while thanking him for the support.\n\nAccording to the Post, although DeSantis endorsed Trump after dropping out of the GOP primary, the pair had not spoken since.

A potent and effective Fourth Estate is needed.\n\nThis addresses two concerns. One, the criticality of infrastructure build-up as a blanket platform that provides a basic pathway out of latent economic woes. And two, initiatives to develop an empowered, determined and dogged media that not simply reports on infrastructure, but asks the right questions and effectively investigates, audits, and keeps infrastructure's traditional propensity for fraud and corruption from burying us deeper in debt and destitution.\n\nThat second concern is important as many in media metamorphose into mere mouthpieces on one end and on the other, to survive, media meanders into entertainment, providing opium for cancers. As such, unfortunately providing no diagnoses, and thus, leading to no cures.\n\nBut first, an environmental scan.\n\nWe are not dead. At least not yet. Never mind that there are several vulnerable medium to small-scale enterprises, including former formidable corporate giants, who might think our economy is headed towards that inevitable condition as existential threats from incompetent economic management under the Marcos administration worsen.\n\nOne recent example is our continuing dependence on two of the most influential goods that account for the debilitating inflation that the diminished purchasing power of the peso and the high underemployment data simply cannot catch up with fast enough.\n\nEven kitchen table food staples like rice, sugar, even salt that account for a substantial portion of our basket of goods and the consumer price index remain stratospherically priced and imported. So does the manic-depressive roller-coaster ride in fuel prices whose weekly schizophrenia has led the public to completely capitulate and surrender its ill-fate to the oil companies and the limp-wristed bystander perspective of impotent energy authorities who oversee these sectors.\n\nDespite the undeniably positive directions taken by the Department of Agriculture (DA) - now under new, greatly improved, and professional management - to study, consult and provide focused support for Philippine rice farmers, the importation bias of the DA's former failed leadership remains. While such bias might temper rice prices a tad, traders and importers continue to be the primary beneficiaries, cursing by the wayside the historically victimized farmers already on subsistence mode.\n\nThe inequity that favors a select few at the expense of the many is characteristic of the renewed cronyism afflicting the headline inflation drivers from food to fuels.\n\nA case in point is the prospect of continuing in the business of rice planting by a moderately successful rice farmer who, as he barely ekes out a profit, is now threatened with having to defend his anemic income against a threatening tax audit. 'Dead\" is a word he eloquently uses to describe prospects for continuing his heroic entrepreneurship.\n\nIt is not surprising. Death is an appropriate word. Recently, even one of the largest and perhaps most iconic sugar refineries (central azucarera) was forced to permanently close, an inevitable demise catalyzed by the unbridled prohibitive costs of operations to provide a local staple relative to the importation of cheaper refined sugar. Its defining death, again a boon for a select few sugar traders and importers.\n\nRegarding the other catalyst of debilitating headline inflation, the dizzying ups and downs of fuel prices as well as the continuing power outages since the start of the year provides a tsunami of volatility that shelves capital formation, foreign direct investments (FDI) and keeps us at the end of the list of desired destinations among investors.\n\nWhen the late former president Benigno S. Aquino declared the Philippines as \"open for business,\" he realized the importance of both infrastructure and FDI as critical to alleviating structural economic inequities, the inflationary effects of food shortages, the surrender to foreign fuels and the curses we enumerated above.\n\nAquino's \"Private-Public Partnerships\" (PPP) program and the \"Build, build, build\" initiative needed FDI, both domestic and foreign capital, lest they exert tremendous fiscal burdens and necessitate aggressive taxation. Note that among recent presidents, only Aquino avoided new taxes while kicking off a series of tax reforms that increased the exemption brackets for the poor while effectively lowering income taxation for corporations. It is a belief in the Laffer Curve and supply-side economics where lowering taxation, increasing efficiencies, and reducing regulation promotes freer trade and development.\n\nAnd allow us to add, it reduces the amount of tax money stolen by crooks.\n\nTo avoid bloating debt, fiscal deficits, and increased taxation, such an initiative requires the infusion of private capital in infrastructure to lower the costs to process goods through individual value chains.\n\nNote how competently planned farm-to-market infrastructure shortens the gaps between farmers and consumers. Note how ports, railways, roads, and bridges reduce travel time, decrease instances of food waste and spoilage, and avoid those extortion \"checkpoints\" that artificially increase food prices. Note how farmer's markets, strategically located hubs, drying facilities, cold storage, and cold chain infrastructure funded by critical FDI and PPP can alleviate food inflation.\n\nSo here we invariably answer two of our reader's amazingly perceptive questions.\n\nPrivate sector capital is critical for infrastructure development, and we cannot back-burner that because of the negative effects of a transactional relationship between government and the private sector. That said, third-party watchdog audits, checks and balances, investigative reporting, and serious scrutiny by our threatened media - what was once a potent and effective Fourth Estate - is needed.\n\nDespite the conflicts of interest and the hidden snakes that live within the capital structures of most of local media, some have boldly taken mitigating measures. For instance, Rappler is constantly developing its independence using innovative forms to fortify its autonomy and financial freedom including attracting in-depth discourses and analyses, more extensive coverages and beefing up its in-house capacities to dive deeper into issues.\n\nIn the academe where the foundations and the future of our nation is formed, students and educators alongside mid-career media professionals are now undergoing extensive training and education on investigating the relationship between the private sector and government in infrastructure. These are recent developments catalyzed by the realization that crony capitalism has returned with a vengeance.", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/04/PPP-and-media.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 452044420, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b00"}

If that's the case, how are they ethically able to produce a reported one million new garments in one day?\n\nIf we were to look at Shein's environmental practices alone, sustainable and ethical fashion brand aggregator Good On You disparagingly summarises the key issues at hand:\n\nAnd that's just the start.\n\nShein has garnered a sordid reputation thanks to its myriad of controversies.\n\nThe e-commerce brand, which is reliant on digital influencer marketing to generate the majority of its advertising, has been found to severely underpaid workers, exploit and plagiarize the designs of emerging creatives, has reportedly sold Nazi symbols and produces garments that contain an unsafe level of toxic chemicals.\n\nThat's not even mentioning the \"help me\" messages reportedly found on the labels of their clothes, which were purported to be left by workers in their manufacturing factories. Shein has since called these notes \"confusion\", but has still not addressed the claims that they exploit their workers.\n\nA new documentary shone a light on how truly abhorrent the working conditions in Shein's factories are.\n\nUntold: Inside The Shein Machine from reporter Iman Amrani takes viewers inside Shein's business model and offers the first ever undercover investigation into the Chinese factories producing the clothes.\n\nThe documentary explores the real cost of Shein's cheap clothing, and the price human lives have to pay in return for a polyester crop top that will cost less than your morning iced oat latte.\n\nThe film offers an undoctored view into the factories Shein uses when manufacturing their clothes, revealing that employees are severely overworked and underpaid -- earning less than $20 per week.\n\nYet, when one of the 6.9 billion #sheinhauls comes across our TikTok pages, our thoughts are not with the human being who created the garment, or even on the life span or ethical disposal of the piece when it no longer serves as purpose to us.\n\nWe have no regard for the worker who was found to be paid $4,000 yuan (approximately $879 AUD) annually, encouraged to work up to 18 hours per day and penalised two-thirds of their daily wage if they made a mistake on a garment.\n\nOn top of that, these employees were only given one day of leave each month and were found washing their hair during lunch breaks due to their toxic working environment.\n\nShein claims to never violate labour laws, yet these working conditions are in strict breach of Chinese labour law which states that \"workweeks cannot exceed 40 hours\".\n\nIn Shein's own 2021 sustainability and social impact report, they themselves found that 66% of their suppliers' factories violated their code of conduct, with a further 12% in violation of their zero tolerance violation policy.\n\nIn over 700 audits completed in 2021, 14% of factories were found to violate working hours, with another 27% violating fire and emergency preparedness.\n\nThese findings are shocking, but to slow fashion aficionados, they're nothing new. This isn't the first allegation of its kind against Shein. In 2021, a Swiss based industry watchdog group called Public Eye released a report detailing unethical working conditions.\n\n\"[Employees] work after dinner every day of the week except one, with one day off per month,\" a researcher, whose identity was kept anonymous, told the watchdog of their on-the-ground findings. The same researcher alleged they didn't see \"a single emergency exit, and that the entrances and stairs don't allow workers to leave the premises quickly\".\n\n\"I don't want to think about what would happen if a fire broke out there,\" they added.\n\nAs Victoria Bellandini, senior fashion lecturer at the University of Lincoln, told the BBC: \"You cannot get clothes that cheap that are made in good working conditions and until we really know where our clothes are coming from, we can't source these problems.\"\n\nWe've become immune to these types of allegations. There's no transparency from Shein, or other fast fashion labels like BooHoo and Missguided.\n\nSure, Shein has a published supplier code of conduct that strives to \"uphold integrity, respect human rights and further sustainable development\", but these findings are evident that Shein's claims they \"take all supply chain matters seriously\" is a farce.\n\nOf course, we're only scraping the surface here.\n\nPoor labour conditions are only one component that makes up Shein's unethical practice. They claim to be \"turning to sustainable practices and fabrics\", yet there is nothing to substantiate the traceability of their fibres, or how these allegedly \"recycled fabrics\" are sourced.\n\nOur awareness of what makes a brand ethical and sustainable has broadened in recent years, and thankfully we're more aware than ever of the factors at play that makes a brand eco-conscious.\n\nAt a minimum, the slow-fashion methodology dictates that brands need to be transparent and abide to globally-recognised accreditations (like the fashion transparency index), highlight how the clothes are made, know who is producing the garments, be transparent about working conditions and, as Good On You describes, understand \"what environmental impact the products have across their life cycles\".\n\nAs Good On You asserts, Shein \"discloses little to no relevant or concrete information about their sustainability practices\".\n\nThe reality is that the majority of fast fashion finds their way into landfill, littering the earth with the sparkling singlet you may have worn once and then discarded.\n\nShein might be cheap, but the true cost isn't one we want to pay.\n\nEnough is enough. It's time for a slow fashion revolution.", "source": {"uri": "elle.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ava_gilchrist@elle.com.au", "name": "Ava Gilchrist", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.elle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/1666220234660_Shein-Bad.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "eventUri": "eng-9525267", "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 452044342, "relevance": 3, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b01"}

IIT Bombay, for instance, is setting up a Green Energy & Sustainability Research Hub - it recently got a donation of $18.6 million from a US-based alumnus. IIT Delhi is focusing on energy transition and sustainability at its Abu Dhabi campus - thanks to the UAE's push towards sustainability and climate change goals. \"Our new MTech programme will empower graduates with a thorough understanding of advanced technology and progressive policy frameworks to address the intricate challenges of energy transition,\" the institute said.\n\nIIT Kharagpur has set up the School of Environmental Science and Engineering (SESE) to provide a comprehensive understanding of our environment, and economical and effective engineering solutions to environmental problems.\n\nSustainability jobs\n\nAn education analyst told FE that there is a rising demand for graduates who have some kind of green skills. \"Between February 2022 and February 2023, LinkedIn job postings requiring at least one green skill have grown by a median of 15.2%,\" he said. \"Also, around the world, only one in eight workers has one or more green skills - we are far from the green skills penetration that we need. As companies reorient their business models, the need for employees with both specialist sustainability knowledge and an understanding of business fundamentals will rise.

(WTVD) -- The COPA restaurant in Durham got a new lease on life after posting online appeals for serious monetary support.\n\nOwners Roberto Matos and Elisabeth Turnbull wrote on social media:\n\n\"We need your help. The pandemic, our now sky-high interest rate from our Small Business Association mortgage, and the sharp increase in the cost of doing business mean that we urgently need legal assistance to hold off foreclosure and continue to do our work of building community one meal at a time.\"\n\nTurnbull said the interest rate on the loan soared while in-person dining dropped 25 percent at COPA, which prompted their public posts requesting help from their customers and supporters of locally owned restaurants.\n\n\"We opened COPA in 2018 and we have now 12 people (on their payroll) and we have been together, most of us, through the pandemic, through all the challenges of the pandemic,\" said Matos. \"But now this is a new challenge and new hurdle, and it's been a very interesting journey for us because we have had to recreate and reinvent the wheel.\"\n\nThat journey began with their first farm-to-table restaurant, The Old Havana Sandwich Shop that operated in the space now occupied by Missy Lane's Assembly Room, a few blocks up Main Street from COPA.\n\n\"Before the pandemic, we used to serve easily close to 200 people a night. Now, it's a rare night that we serve more than 120 diners. So it's a big difference,\" Matos said. \"But at the same time, we have to still be able to pay bills. And that only happens when we have a community that comes out regularly to eat.\"\n\nMatos and Turnbull said the response to their social media appeal was massive, big enough to keep the doors open for now.\n\n\"I am overwhelmed, overwhelmed by how much love has been poured onto us and it is reflected in that in less than 24 hours, we received the funds that we said that we needed in order to continue moving forward,\" he said. \"And that has been beautiful. One of the things that has been going through my mind is that in businesses and in capitalism, you're thinking about profits, and profits are measured by how much money you have left at the end of everything.\"\n\n\"But there is much more than profit. And this example of us putting an alarm out there for our community, and them coming to support us financially, also making sure that they came this last weekend to us, and tell us how much it matters to them that we exist, that we do what we do. It is another way to make sure what we small businesses do and how we contribute to their community. That they want to keep coming and keep supporting us.\"\n\nThey're working on ideas and adjustments to their business model that can help the restaurant stay afloat, like frozen prepared specialty meals that diners can heat up at home. It's their response to the current popular Door Dash meal delivery option that's embraced by many of their potential customers.\n\n\"Elizabeth and I believe that one of the main functions, missions of the independent restaurant industry is to be a place where we can all come together from all different backgrounds. From all different cultures and to socialize,\" said Matos. \"We try to put out the best quality food, the best quality service, the best cocktails that we can produce. But one of the main results of that is that we come together as a community that we have a space to be together, that we have the experience of being together. And there is a risk that we may be losing that. I think in general in the country, the number of restaurants closing, independent restaurants closing, is larger than the ones that are being opened. And we need to be careful with that. I think that we need a conversation in our community and a national conversation about what's going on and what's happening.\"\n\nCoincidentally, the lifeline for COPA arrived days before the start of Triangle Restaurant Week, when the community is encouraged to support locally-owned dining options.\n\n\"I know a lot of places were shut down, and walking around in Durham we're kind of sad that some of our favorite places went out of business,\" said Ashley Crosby as she and her husband, Matthew Ellis, strolled along Main Street. \"So we definitely want to support local and shop small and make sure our community stays open.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "abc11 News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14741149_042824wtvd-copa-foreclosure-anthony-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 452044323, "relevance": 4, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b05"}

From a lowly seventh on the grid, he'd danced on the edge of extreme risk to propel his Ducati into the fight at the front in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, only to inherit the lead when MotoGP championship leader Jorge Martin (Ducati) crashed out ahead of him on lap 11 of 25.\n\nPlain sailing for a win then, surely? Not so fast.\n\nThree laps later, Marc Marquez passed Marco Bezzecchi for second place in another Ducati spot swap. Bagnaia didn't need his pit board to tell him who was behind him - the record Jerez crowd's roar gave him all of the information he needed. It would be a matter of time before the six-time world champion, chasing his first win in three years, would be all over him.\n\nEvery MotoGP qualifying, practice and race LIVE and ad-break free from lights out to the chequered flag. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nIt was time, Bagnaia knew, that had to be used to conjure a plan to fight, then take flight. And it was one he employed to perfection to take victory in a race between the present and past kings of MotoGP, the former trying to get a stuttering title defence back on track, the latter issuing a reminder of the quality and ferocity that still lies within.\n\nBagnaia versus Marquez was the talking point from the fourth round of the season in front of the biggest event crowd Jerez has ever seen - 296,741 fans poured into the circuit across three days.\n\nElsewhere, Australia's Jack Miller was as perplexed as he was peeved after a Spain weekend that went from bad to worse, while French veteran Johann Zarco didn't hold back after a trip to the race stewards left him angrier than when his Honda was taken out by Aprilia's Aleix Espargaro.\n\nBAGNAIA'S SUBLIME 97 SECONDS\n\nBagnaia's advantage over Marquez was 1.024secs after the Spanish legend brushed Bezzecchi aside, and the Italian knew he had to take the initiative.\n\nSitting in a comfortable lead and managing his tyres, Bagnaia had been lapping in the 1min 38sec bracket for four laps before upping the pace on laps 17 (1:37.816) and 18 (1:37.954). Still, Marquez's shadow loomed ever-larger. It was time to change tactics.\n\n\"When I saw Marc was behind, I pushed two laps, but I saw that he was gaining,\" Bagnaia said.\n\n\"So I just think to don't stress too much the tyre in that moment, because in any case he was catching. I just tried to have a bit more tyres for the last three laps.\"\n\nWith five laps left, Marquez was just a tenth of a second adrift. He ambushed Bagnaia into the circuit's famed amphitheatre section at Turns 9-10 to briefly take the lead on lap 21, Bagnaia immediately fighting back. The next lap, Marquez went again, and Bagnaia held his line and left Marquez with black Michelin tyre rubber on the right shoulder of his sky-blue leathers.\n\nAnd then Bagnaia pulled the pin.\n\nWith whatever grip his 22-lap-old medium compound Michelin tyres had left, Bagnaia uncorked 97 seconds of genius on lap 23. His first, third and fourth sectors of the four-sector lap were his fastest all race, and a circuit-record 1:37.449 was the result. The gap was instantly four-tenths of a second, and while Marquez risked it all to set his fastest lap on the final lap of the 25-lap race, Bagnaia had done enough.\n\n\"As soon as he makes the second attempt on corner nine, I just try to push again from that moment a lot,\" Bagnaia said.\n\n\"The 1:37.4 arrives, and it helped a lot to arrive with a bit of breath in the last lap.\"\n\nFor a rider who has won 59 premier-class Grands Prix and six titles, Marquez isn't a man accustomed to having his nose bloodied in a stoush, nor be satisfied with second place.\n\nBut days like Sunday were exactly what he envisaged when he made the difficult decision to leave Honda after 11 years and those half-dozen championships, feeling it was the Japanese manufacturer's flailing machinery - rather than his battered body after years of surgeries - that was holding him back.\n\nAt the circuit where his massive crash in 2020 damaged his shoulder and sent his career off-course, Marquez was euphoric just to be in the fight again, even if it was one he lost. Second was his first dry-weather podium since Australia 2022, and his Jerez weekend as a whole - his first pole for Ducati, leading (before crashing) in a chaotic Saturday sprint race and requiring Bagnaia to dig deep into his bag of brilliance to deny the home hero a famous win was, for now, enough. His joy afterwards was plain to see.\n\n\"It was an important race, a super important race,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a tight fight, even like old times. This is good, it's racing. I tried to close the door [on Bagnaia], but he was [on the] inside and this is something that happens in the racing.\n\n\"He was super good, he pushed, and he did the fastest lap of the race. I tried to follow him, he had a bit more, but I'm super happy for this first podium. As you see, it doesn't matter what happened in the past - just I fight until the end.\"\n\nAsked in the post-event press conference whether respect or rivalry was more important in his fight with Marquez, Bagnaia was unequivocal.\n\n\"You know perfectly when you fight with Marc you have to put your elbows out, and it was a nice battle for me,\" he said, as Marquez intently watched on.\n\n\"Respect is always the most important thing. When there is respect, there is [a] show and there is fun. Without respect, it's impossible to have nice battles and to enjoy for me.\"\n\nJerez was where Jack Miller's wretched opening to the season was supposed to turn around. The Spanish circuit was where the Australian took his first - and so far only - Grand Prix podium for KTM last year, but any thoughts of a repeat performance got off to a shaky start when he crashed in Friday practice, having to fight his way out of Q1 to be in contention for a top-10 grid slot on Saturday.\n\nAnd then things really went haywire.\n\nQualifying was a mess after the rear wheel of his bike proved inexplicably stubborn to fit, seeing him late on track and qualify a season-worst 15th. In Saturday's sprint, a clutch issue on downshifts saw him crash at the final corner on lap one, remounting to finish 14th before copping a post-race tyre pressure infringement penalty that made no difference to his finishing position.\n\nAnd then came Sunday's race, where Miller fought through to eighth on lap three before dropping back to 11th, where he was taken out by Ducati's Franco Morbidelli at Turn 5. Miller was initially enraged - he confronted Morbidelli in the trackside gravel trap before marshals got between them - and then baffled by the Italian's words after his actions, which the stewards deemed to be a racing incident and not worthy of penalty.\n\n\"I got a telling off [by the stewards] for my actions afterwards ... I didn't hit him, I didn't want to punch him or anything like that. I was just obviously frustrated,\" Miller said.\n\n\"Franky said to me in the gravel 'what did I do to him yesterday?'. I was honestly quite dumbfounded because I crashed out on the f**king first lap yesterday, so I don't know what I could have done [to him]. Whether or not he had me confused for somebody else ... anyway, it is what it is.\"\n\nAfter four rounds, Miller's season has gone from bad to worse, the 29-year-old sinking to 14th in the world championship with just 22 points. After four rounds last year, he had 49.\n\n\"I don't know if I've run over a black cat or walked under a ladder ... but we're just struggling to get luck turning our way,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll stick with it, keep on the program. I've been at rock-bottom before, and fingers crossed we're at it now and we can build back up.\"\n\nA lap 10 coming-together between Aleix Espargaro (Aprilia) and Johann Zarco (Honda) would normally have been a footnote after such a dramatic race in Spain - but that was before the Frenchman launched a savage private and then public dressing-down of chief MotoGP steward Freddie Spencer in the aftermath.\n\nZarco and Espargaro were scrapping over 16th place before the Spaniard took his rival out at the same corner where Miller and Morbidelli came to blows eight laps later, and were summoned to the stewards to explain the incident after the race.\n\nEmerging from the meeting with Spencer, the American former 500cc and 250cc world champion, Zarco spoke to French TV network Canal+, saying he'd told Spencer \"I said to Freddie: 'I don't like you. The job you do, you do it badly'.\"\n\nBy the time he met with the English-speaking media, Zarco was ready to explain the cause of his ire.\n\n\"Freddie Spencer was watching the action with us, and it seems he was looking at me, that he wanted to know what [penalty] I want. He wanted me to complain about Aleix,\" he said.\n\n\"I told him he is not good for this job ... because he doesn't take the right decision in the right moment. He's looking at us - I was with Aleix - like we are two children and they [the stewards panel] want to do a moral lesson. No, Freddie. You have maybe a lot of passion but you don't take the right decision, you are not in the right place.\"\n\nEspargaro later revealed that he'd tried to diffuse the volatile situation between Zarco and the stewards, who issued no penalty for the incident.\n\n\"Johann was very, very angry with race direction,\" Espargaro said, adding: \"I was on Johann's side ... I think the situation can be handled much, much better.\n\n\"[But] when I saw Johann doing that, I took him and I went with him outside to try to help him. But I can understand him perfectly.\"\n\nZarco said the lack of penalty for Espargaro \"doesn't change my life\", before doubling-down on his criticism of Spencer.\n\n\"Aleix today, it's just a pity that we crashed and it was a bad place to crash,\" he said.\n\n\"We are OK, but all the things after that are wrong ... and I repeat, Freddie Spencer is not the right guy in this place.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/68f563e415b6e50cce03be5ff7536ed9", "eventUri": "eng-9516695", "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 452044783, "relevance": 4, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b06"}

Shan S/Unsplash\n\nThe Covid crisis has profoundly transformed working practices, driven by employees seeking flexibility. Although teleworking has become the norm almost everywhere, working people are still tempted by expatriation. But there is no question of them setting down their suitcases anywhere in the world.\n\nEnglish-speaking countries are still popular with expatriate candidates, according to the 4th edition of the 'Decoding Global Talent\"* study. Australia is the most attractive destination in their eyes, ahead of the United States and Canada. Workers who plan to settle abroad are attracted by the country of kangaroos for the professional opportunities it offers, as well as the quality of life enjoyed by its inhabitants. Indeed, Australia is one of the happiest countries to live in, according to the latest United Nations report on world happiness.\n\nAlthough no European country appears in the top three, the Old Continent remains well represented in the Top 10 most popular destinations for employees who would like to emigrate. The United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Spain have found a place there, as has France, which occupies 9th place. The capital of France is in 13th position in the ranking of cities that are most popular with expatriate candidates. London, Amsterdam and Dubai top the list.\n\nIf candidates for expatriation favor certain destinations more than others, they are less inclined to work abroad than expected. On a global scale, interest in international professional mobility continues to decrease since the Covid-19 crisis. Only 8% of French people actively aspire to emigrate in 2023, a rate three times lower than the international average of 23%.\n\nBut how can we explain this reluctance? First of all, by family well-being. 60% of workers interviewed as part of this study are worried about the difficulties they would encounter if they had to move with their family. 38% are afraid to take the plunge due to a strong attachment to their country of origin, while 26% are put off by the language barrier.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that interest in expatriation varies considerably depending on age. In France, young people under 30 are twice as likely to work abroad (16%) as the average.

Hundreds of students are being arrested in universities across the United States. In Spain, hundreds of thousands have protested since the beginning of the war, while in Sanaa, Yemen, over a million people gathered last week to protest the US-backed genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe pseudo-left Revolutionary Left (IR) group, the former Spanish affiliate of both the International Marxist Tendency (IMT) and the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI), is suddenly trying to distance itself from PSOE-Sumar government, and its main ally in parliament, Podemos. All these parties are accomplices in the Israeli genocide against the Palestinians.\n\nUnder first the PSOE-Podemos government (2020-2023), and now the PSOE-Sumar government, IR backed these parties of capitalist government and worked to block working class opposition on their left. Both governments increased trade, military, and economic relations with the Zionist regime, particularly in arms. Under PSOE-Podemos, Spain sold weapons to Israel worth hundreds of millions of euros while Madrid spent millions buying weapons with the \"combat-tested\" mark. The PSOE-Sumar government kept buying and selling millions of euros worth of weaponry from Israel.\n\nIR is now attempting to distance itself from these parties, to hide its support for parties complicit in the genocide. In \"PSOE-Sumar, the NATO Government and the militarism,\" IR states:\n\n[W]e cannot place any trust in a government that has demonstrated ad nauseam that it operates for the interests of the capitalists and follows the directives of imperialist masters in Washington. Likewise, other political forces, such as [Podemos], which no longer bear governmental responsibilities but center their entire strategy on institutional action, do not present a viable alternative. Many of the aggressive measures mentioned were endorsed while Podemos held ministerial positions, and their current critique, devoid of any assumption of responsibility, only exacerbates their credibility crisis.\n\nMilitarism is an organic feature of social democracy. Historically, they have consistently acquiesced to the ruling class, and this tendency persists in their current bellicose stance in Ukraine, their NATO alignment, and their complicity with the Zionist genocide. This leftist faction does not constitute part of the solution but rather contributes to the problem.\n\nIR is running from Podemos like rats fleeing from a sinking ship. IR knows Podemos and Sumar's support is plummeting to all-time lows. In the regional elections held this year in Galicia and the Basque Country, Podemos failed to win any seats. Eight years before, Podemos was the most voted party in the Basque Country. The polls are equally dire for the upcoming European elections, where Podemos is expected to receive 2.3 percent of the vote, down from 10 percent in 2019.\n\nSumar, a split-off from Podemos ruling with the PSOE at national level, is also collapsing. It did not obtain any lawmakers in Galicia and only one seat in the Basque Country. It is polling at 2.9 percent in European elections.\n\nThe crisis of the main \"Left Populist\" parties of bourgeois rule in Spain is exposing IR's own bankruptcy. Over the past decade, IR has been one of the greatest cheerleaders of Podemos and its participation in a PSOE-led government. In 2019, when Podemos entered into government, IR wrote that this \"represents an event of historical significance which has raised enormous expectations.\" Such a government,\" they said, was \"the result of the great mass mobilization that has shaken the Spanish State.\"\n\nDespite Podemos' flagrantly right-wing policies -- raising the military budget, slashing pensions and wages, providing billions of euros in corporate bailouts and pursuing a profits-over-lives policy in the COVID-19 pandemic that cost over 140,000 lives -- IR kept working as a de facto faction of Podemos.\n\nIR threw all its strength into supporting the leader and founder of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, in the Madrid regional elections in 2021. It called for a Podemos vote with posters larger than those of the pseudo-left party itself. They boasted of hanging 11,000 posters and distributing more than 121,000 pamphlets backing Iglesias.\n\nOver the next years, the PSOE-Podemos government escalated its war at home and abroad. It provided hundreds of millions in weaponry to the far-right Ukrainian regime in the NATO war against Russia, massacred refugees on Spain's borders, imposed minimum service requirements on air crews, and attacked striking truck drivers and metal workers. All the while, it intensified its support for the far-right Netanyahu government, despite it brutal occupation of Gaza that led to the October 7 uprising against Israel.\n\nNonetheless, IR once again called the \"left\" to rally behind the PSOE-Sumar government after last year's elections. In November 2023, the PSOE and Sumar formed a new coalition government, without Podemos. Soon after, IR posted an article titled \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez supports his investiture: a Government for social peace and collaboration with imperialism.\" While admitting the reactionary character of the PSOE-Sumar government, IR continued:\n\n\"Despite everything, the constitution of a PSOE-Sumar Government appears in the eyes of a large majority of our class as a million times preferable to a PP-Vox Government. From Revolutionary Left we perfectly understand this opinion. Of course, it would be profoundly wrong for the left-wing forces with parliamentary representation to deny their critical support for S\u00e1nchez's investiture!\"\n\nSoon after, IR welcomed Podemos' exit from government as many of its voters joined pro-Palestinian protests. The largest and most sustained anti-war movement since the Vietnam War era was erupting around the world, with millions participating in protests. IR stated \"From Revolutionary Left we welcome this decision, and we say that it has to be the beginning of a real break with the social democratic policies of that left that has become an essential prop of capitalist rule...\"\n\nPodemos left government not because it opposed the genocide in Gaza, austerity or militarism, all of which it supported from 2020 to 2023. To make clear its continuing support for the PSOE and Sumar, Podemos leader Ione Belarra declared that \"the democratic forces [Podemos, PSOE and Sumar] must work together\" against the far-right.\n\nIR now is following the exact same path. It is distancing itself from Podemos, the same way Podemos took distance from the PSOE-Sumar government. However, it aims not to mobilize working class opposition to the PSOE-Sumar government, but to guard the left flank of the pseudo-left parties tasked with defending the strategic interests of Spanish imperialism.\n\nIR is promoting regionalist and nationalist forces that defend the PSOE-Sumar government in parliament. For the Galician elections, it called for a vote to the Nationalist Galician Bloc (BNG), stating: \"It would be very important to strengthen street action and demand from day one that a BNG-PSOE Government fulfills its promises.\" In the Basque country it called to vote for the Basque-nationalist EH Bildu party, arguing, \"we are not abstentionists, and that is why we ask for a critical vote for EH Bildu.\"\n\nBoth parties have supported the PSOE-Podemos and the PSOE-Sumar governments in hiking military expenditure to record levels and turning Spain into a spearhead of NATO against Russia in Ukraine.\n\nIR justifies its support for these parties under the idea that \"Revolutionary communists, Leninists, have never championed abstentionism\" in elections. This is a shameless and miserable charade. IR has never been a Marxist organization. This organization traces its roots back to a British-based group led by Ted Grant that broke with Trotskyism and split from the Fourth International in the late 1940s.\n\nThe Grant group subsequently became among the most vociferous promoters of Pabloism, which the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was formed to fight in 1953. Adapting to the post-Second World War social order, the Pabloites wrote off the working class as an independent revolutionary force. They argued that the Stalinist bureaucracy, bourgeois nationalist movements in the colonial countries, and the union and social-democratic bureaucracies would be transformed under mass pressure into revolutionary organizations.\n\nGrant and his followers developed \"entryism\" as a permanent strategic orientation. They aimed not at politically educating workers through a struggle against the pro-capitalist bureaucracies, but to keep radicalized workers within the confines of the Labour Party and trade union bureaucracies.\n\nIn Spain, IR demanded that workers and youth should subordinate themselves to the PSOE in the 1980s, then the Stalinist-led United Left and then Podemos since 2014. Now, faced with the growing collapse of Podemos, IR is searching for new tools to prop up the discredited PSOE-Sumar government.\n\nMobilizing the working class to halt the genocide requires breaking with the nationalist outlook of pseudo-left groups that subordinate workers to the Spanish capitalist state. Only an international, independent movement of the working class can halt arms deliveries to Israel, stop repression of protests, and end the wars. The political basis of such a movement is the International Committee of the Fourth International's struggle to expose pseudo-left tendencies such as IR and build sections of the ICFI in Spain and internationally as the revolutionary leadership of the working class.\n\nRead moreSpain's Podemos politically complicit in the genocide of Palestinians15 March 2024Podemos electoral debacle in Spain exposes bankruptcy of Revolutionary Left (IR) group22 June 2023Spain's pseudo-left Revolutionary Left promotes M\u00e9lenchon in France, Podemos government at home24 May 2023Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:SpainThe Politics of the Pseudo-LeftStop Israel's genocide in Gaza!Europe", "source": {"uri": "wsws.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Socialist"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.wsws.org/asset/85fd71dc-feed-499c-a233-8b8fb336c260?rendition=1600x900", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 452043174, "relevance": 21, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b0e"}

The 2026 eclipse will be visible in Greenland and Iceland rather than major Spanish cities like Madrid and Barcelona. The next total eclipse in Spain will be on 2 August 2027, with southern Spain and other regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East in the path.\n\nNorth America just experienced a once-in-a-lifetime solar eclipse, with millions of people seeing it. But that's it for the United States as it won't experience another total solar eclipse until 23 August 2044 (and even then, it will only be seen in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota). That being said, there will be a remote solar eclipse over parts of Alaska in 2033. So, what country will enjoy the most solar eclipses in the next decade?\n\nAccording to Forbes, Spain will experience not one or two, but three eclipses before the end of the decade. The second eclipse will be by far the most dramatic and one of the best places to see it will be the tiny British Rock of Gibraltar (home to Europe's only population of wild macaques).\n\nTotal Solar Eclipse 12 August 2026\n\nThe 2026 eclipse will come at dusk and will be better seen in northwestern Spain as it goes towards Iceland and Greenland\n\nAlhambra Palace in Granada\n\nIt turns out Spain won't have to wait too long to experience its solar eclipse. On 12 August 2026, northern Spain will experience a total eclipse. The eclipse will start over the Mediterranean Sea and head across northern Spain and then up into the North Atlantic, where it will be visible in Greenland and Iceland.\n\nUnfortunately, this eclipse will not be visible in the major Spanish cities of Madrid or Barcelona.\n\nWhere in Spain:\n\nNorthern Spain\n\nAlternative places:\n\nGreenland, Iceland, Arctic\n\nDate:\n\n12 August 2026\n\nType:\n\nTotal Solar Eclipse\n\nMaximum totality:\n\n2 minutes and 18 seconds\n\nWhile the Spanish city of Valencia will be in the path of the eclipse, it will miss out as the pre-sunset eclipse will occur 10 degrees above the west in northern Spain but only two degrees from Mallorca. This means the Spanish East Coast will miss out on it. For the best views, go to Galicia in northwest Spain and places like Santander, Bilbao, Gijon, and Burgos.\n\nThis will be the first total eclipse over continental Europe since 11 August 1990 and the first total solar eclipse over Spain since 30 August 1905 (which also followed a similar path across Spain).\n\nRelated This Will Be The First City To Experience The Solar Eclipse Kerrville will witness the total eclipse for four minutes and 24 seconds and NASA will attend its festival.\n\nTotal Solar Eclipse 2 August 2027\n\nThe 2027 eclipse will be a major event for much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East\n\nTime Magazine states that Spain only has to wait less than a year until it experiences the next total solar eclipse on the early morning of 2 August 2027 (the sun will be around 37 degrees or halfway up).\n\nSouthern Spain will be on the path of totality as totality commences over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and travels across the Strait of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco, as well as across North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nWhere in Spain:\n\nCadiz, Malaga (southern Spain)\n\nAlternative places:\n\nMorocco, Gibraltar, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen\n\nDate:\n\n2 August 2027\n\nType:\n\nTotal Solar Eclipse\n\nMaximum totality:\n\n6 minutes and 22 seconds.\n\nThe partial eclipse will also cover more than 90% of the sun in parts of Ireland, Great Britain, Portugal, Italy, France, the Balkans, North Africa and bits of North America. This is an eclipse that will be witnessed by a very large portion of the populations of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nThe place with the maximum duration of totality will be around 37 miles southeast of Luxor in Egypt, where it will last 6 minutes and 22 seconds (Luxor is where visitors can see the famed Tomb of Tutankhamun). The greatest totality in Spain will be around 4 minutes and 39 seconds on the south coast between Cadiz and Malaga (fortunately, these are also among the amazing Spanish cities to visit for the first time).\n\nNotable cities in the path of the totality include Cadiz and Malaga in southern Spain, Tangier in Morocco, Gibraltar, Oran in Algeria, Sfax in Tunisia, Luxor in Egypt, Jeddah and Mecca in Saudi Arabia, and Sana'a in Yemen.\n\nRelated 'Flower Moon' & Lunar Eclipses: 10 Celestial Events To See This Year & Where To See Them Wondering when and where to see lunar events and eclipses this year?

The reason is easy. Because the poor might tremble with rage. The divide between the rich and poor tends to crack wide open, and fissures of bile might spill onto the streets in the forms of riots and revolutionary turmoil.\n\nThe rich do not want it. The poor do not deserve it. Wise governments avoid it. Revolutions of that sort have never helped the fortunes of the downtrodden. Order, with all its imperfections, helps the poor more than a retreat to anarchy.\n\nThe British society knows this better than any advanced country. Hence, since its Glorious Revolution of 1688, there has never erupted any social upheaval, unlike the United States or Italy or Spain. The French sparked many tumults before and after the 1789 Revolution and it is still fragile today. It was because of its tendency to excitement and wars that Pierre de Coubertin, father of the modern Olympics, projected sports in the modern era to dissuade the street from kaboom of guns and coups to the hurrahs of games. Enter soccer, cricket, athletics, et al, as competitive and organized sports. Old-time gladiators were back, without the lions, bulls, clubs and blood spills.\n\nSports is a big tool. The other is food. Food must come first, and then games. According to Roman Poet Juvenal, \"Give them (the people) bread and circus, and they will never revolt.\" Juvenal knew about bread, and every wise leader, indeed a family head, who craves peace and order must pacify the dinner table. If you go to bed hungry, you will growl from your bed against the light of dawn\n\nIt is not however enough to give them food and sports. After all, Roman emperor Commodus provided both but died from a lover's vial. You must do it with compassion and purpose. That is what today calls for, and no governor is doing it better than the Lagos State Governor, the BOS of Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nJust last week, he launched Eko Cares, a string of programmes highlighted by a drive to feed 500,000 families. In the menu are rice, garri, elubo, etc. He is not handing out a cynical loaf as if to oafs. His is not the indifferent rich man and the longsuffering Lazarus. He is doing it with a clear-headed understanding of the different dimensions of need. One of such sterling moments was when he lined up what is now known as Ounje Eko - Lagos food. Some had thought it was a recipe for chaos. We saw the Customs example where a quest to kill hunger killed souls. Queues and greed replaced order and decency. It was a failure of organization plus the people's contempt for civility. It recalls the scriptures when David wrote, \"the destruction of the poor is their poverty.\" Another translation renders it, \"Poverty ruins the poor.\" The poor were given a low-hanging fruit. They hanged instead.\n\nRead Also: Sanwo-Olu unveils Eko Cares Wednesday\n\nBut Ounje Eko did not go the way of chaos. It has been so successful and so desired that Governor Sanwo-Olu has decided to continue with it. Nor did the Soup Bowl programme err in its quest to feed between one thousand and one thousand five hundred citizens.\n\nThe Sunday market may seem strange to many city dwellers. But it casts back to the history of markets in Nigerian villages. Markets were not everyday phenoms. Market days happened once a week or month. It was not a day just to buy and sell. It was a mini festival. It was a fare to display wares and wears, to eat exotic meals and discover them, for nubile teens and ingenues to flaunt their maiden beauty and musclebound boys to gawp and woo.\n\nBOS' Sunday market is a Lagos iteration of that tradition. It is to save the rich and middle class. it pares 25 percent of the prices. Testimonies abound.\n\nBut this is part of a wider intervention in these hard times. In Juvenal's time, transportation was not an integral part of daily budgets. Peasants, like my late grandmother, reveled in the reach and dabs of their treks. Today, we have to pay to go to work. His emphasis on completing the trains, blue and red, show that when you feed, you also move. To move has been a feature of the modern persona. The Nobel Prize winner Olga Tokarczuk wrote in her novel Flight, that \"Barbarians don't travel.\"\n\nNow, workers pay less to the bus and to ferry by boat. The trains remind one of the British trains in its early days in the 19th century of commuting in England. Prime Minister William Gladstone made sure they paid a penny less a mile, in what the people called parliamentary trains. Today, it is one of the hallmarks of mobile Britain. I call it 'penny train.'\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu extends the package to health with free child delivery and a squad making the rounds to administer free tests for today's culprits: Diabetes, blood pressure and eye disease. For education, teachers enjoy subsidized transport, and workers can work for four days without compromising efficiency. The governor already has anticipated wage increase. He said with a mild boast that no one earns less than N70,000 in his government.\n\nThis is our early conversion to a welfare state. It is not codified in law or in system in the country. On a national scale, we are seeing snippets of it with the palliatives, reorganized school feeding, school loans project, consumer credit scheme, etc.\n\nThe British started it with its bill of rights. Other countries, including the Scandinavia, have perfected it. It takes a society with a settled minimum prosperity to guarantee it, but it requires, above all, a will and a leap of faith.\n\nCapitalism is brutal, and it is a tyrant to the poor. Marx envisioned socialism, and thinkers and poets worried as well. Oliver Goldsmith lamented that, \"Ill fares the land/To hastening ills a prey/ when wealth accumulates and men decay.\" British best ever playwright after Shakespeare, George Bernard Shaw, expounded on the topic later in his famous essay, \"How Wealth accumulates and men decay.\"\n\nWise men saved capitalism by caring for the poor. There has never been a better system, in spite of the ululation of the Marxist who are now today's screaming dinosaurs.\n\nOther states may not have Governor Sanwo-Olu's wherewithal, but they may do well to step up their games.

His judgment that Labour may be more competent and committed to these socialist policies is undoubtedly correct, but it does not disguise the bald truth that the Tories have abandoned Conservatism.\n\nNone of this helps me decide who to vote for in the forthcoming election. The Conservatives are a spent force, while the Labour Party would take us back to a 1970s Britain of union power stifling nationalised industries, which would be in further decline because the Labour Treasury would deny them funds to invest. The illiberal and undemocratic Liberal Democrats cannot be forgiven for proposing to ignore the result of the referendum and cancel Brexit, and Reform's naive policies would reduce taxation but increase government spending. I feel that the party also carries a nasty vein of populism. Help!\n\nAndrew Dyke\n\nLondon N21\n\nSIR - While I agree with much of Lord Frost's article (\"British politics as we know it is broken. Here's how we Conservatives must rebuild it\", April 27), I think he's over-optimistic if he believes that the Tory party can ever revert to true Conservative principles.\n\nI am considering switching my vote to Reform UK, and would encourage true Conservatives to do the same for both the upcoming council elections then the general election later.\n\nThe modern Tory party appeals to no one as it's become little more than a machine for attaining power - and now the machine is itself broken. A party with no basic principles does not deserve to survive.\n\nStephen Phillips\n\nLondon W11\n\nSIR - When will Conservative backbenchers learn that the cycle of replacing their leader (\"Tory rebels on warpath after MP defects to Labour\", report, April 28) will fail to win over the British electorate, as it shows that they have no concept of the importance of loyalty?\n\nHon Ian MacGregor\n\nLondon N2\n\nSIR - Dan Poulter is now a Labour MP, representing a constituency in which 35,000 voted for the Conservative Party, with a majority of more than 23,000.\n\nThere is not long to go before the next general election, which will provide the good folk of Suffolk Central and Ipswich North, Dr Poulter's constituency, an opportunity to once again be represented by the party for which they voted. Surely it is time the situation that allows MPs to change allegiance should be repealed.\n\nSIR - While the Prime Minister's announcement to increase defence spending by \u00a375 billion is welcome (Letters, April 28), if the polls are to be believed it is unlikely that he will be in a position to implement it.\n\nWords come cheap, actions are much more expensive. If we are to increase defence expenditure to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2030, we now need Sir Keir Starmer to commit the Labour Party to the same course of action. Unless that happens, it is just more rhetoric.\n\nGp Capt G R James (retd)\n\nDuquesa, M\u00e1laga, Spain\n\nSIR - I am not the least surprised that there is a serious shortfall in the number of people applying to join our Armed Forces (Letters, April 25). The recruitment system is abysmal and needs a complete overhaul.\n\nHaving waited six months for an interview, which was held online by an outside agency, my grandson - who is highly qualified and from a family of servicemen - was turned down by the Royal Navy. Whatever happened to in-person interviews, where candidates can be properly assessed?\n\nSIR - Ofsted, despite much evidence and advice, has decided to retain one-word inspection judgments (Letters, April 27). Any school is, by its very nature, a complex organisation, and it is insulting and misleading to sum up an inspection in one word.\n\nI was a headteacher for 20 years and in that time I experienced many inspections (all of them successful). Never did I feel that one word was sufficient to adequately sum up the inspector's findings. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that there is a shortage of teachers in this country.\n\nSIR - John Turner (Letters, April 27) refers to \"the Tory closure of far too much of the network\". Harold Macmillan was the \"villain\" who commissioned Richard Beeching to write a report on railway closures, which saved just \u00a330 million.\n\nHowever, it was Labour's Barbara Castle who closed more than 2,000 miles of railway, including the Varsity Line against the advice of Dr Beeching. It is now sensibly being reinstated as East West Rail, but at some cost.\n\nSIR - When we were young, my ex-Navy father's remedy for flu was two extra blankets on the bed, a hot-water bottle and a glass of hot milk and rum (Letters, April 27). This worked well as a cure, but I still have a deep hatred of even the smell of rum.\n\nJames Rand\n\nLancing, West Sussex\n\nSIR - My family lived in Kenya when I was a child, where many items were difficult or impossible to obtain, and this included most standard medical items. I was therefore treated with a combination of Cointreau for all conditions from the naval upwards, and brandy for anything from the waist downwards.\n\nI suffered no ill effects, but I was a little surprised by the reaction of the school nurse I told when we returned to the UK.\n\nSIR - In an age where attention spans seem to be getting ever shorter, as technology distracts us more and more from focusing on the task in hand, I would question the wisdom of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (BCSO) in allowing the use of phones to photograph and record its concerts (report, April 26).\n\nThis will undoubtedly disturb seasoned concert-goers and professional musicians, as was proved by tenor Ian Bostridge's recent refusal to continue to sing amid the distractions.\n\nIt should instead hold a series of short, introductory concerts, specially designed for those unfamiliar with the world of classical music. The performers could explain the instruments, how they work, and the background to the pieces and their composers in interesting ways than could be related to everyday life.\n\nSurely this would be preferable to turning a concert into something more resembling a press conference. In doing so, the BCSO will lose the loyalty of its regular punters and possibly even the newcomers who, with the highlights captured on their phones, may well not see a need to return.\n\nQuite by chance, on the same day recently the excellent Bach Before Seven on Radio 3 broadcast Johann Sebastian Bach's Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden BWV 230\" (Praise the Lord, all ye nations). The hallelujah chorus there, which dances along beautifully, is to my ears far more attractive.\n\nI seem to be continuing the debate initiated by Samuel Butler more than a century ago as to which of these composers was superior.\n\nSIR - At dinner parties, we often play \"can you name a film that is better than the book\". It is surprisingly difficult, probably because the director visualises it differently to readers, who invariably have strong feelings about how the characters look and act.\n\nHopefully this will not be the case with Richard Osman's bestseller The Thursday Murder Club (report, April 24), which is being made into a star-studded film.\n\nSIR - Venice is trying to discourage visitors in high season by introducing a \u20ac5 entrance fee for day-trippers, a move a former mayor described as \"absurd\" (\"Ex-mayor urges tourists not to pay fee to enter Venice\", report, telegraph.co.uk, April 24), as they are already overcharged for restaurants and public transport.\n\nMore than 30 years ago, sitting at a table in St Mark's Square, I paid \u00a37 for a coffee in Caff\u00e8 Florian.

There is no high season.\n\nMartin Henry\n\nGood Easter, Essex\n\nIt's not just the elderly who miss public lavatories\n\nSIR - Judith Woods is right to bemoan the lack of public lavatories (Letters, April 24), but this has a negative impact on a wider cross-section of the populace than merely the elderly. In London, the shortage is a major issue for taxi drivers, plumbers, carpenters, delivery drivers and countless others who work hard for the benefit of the population. It is also a source of distress for people with health problems, pregnant women and those with small children.\n\nWhere public lavatories are available, the dismal state of some of them can be exceedingly unpleasant. It is hard to believe that local councils cannot spare some pennies in order to allow others to spend theirs.\n\nFrances Luczyc Wyhowska\n\nLondon SW11\n\nSIR - I have just returned from Japan, where the first surprise was the heated seat in the airport's facilities. We found that free public lavatories were everywhere, all scrupulously clean and every one had a heated seat. There was even an occasion when the seat cover lifted itself on my entering the cubicle, almost as a form of welcome.\n\nI wonder what Japanese visitors think of our disappointing facilities?\n\nDavid Jones\n\nBarrington, Cambridgeshire\n\nSIR - My great-grandfather, John Palmer Wallis, was instrumental in the provision of ladies' lavatories in central London, doubtless encouraged by his wife. My mother was told that prior to this a lady's only option was to approach a policeman and say: \"Officer, lend me your cloak.\" She could then squat and modesty would be preserved.\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

To give some perspective, Xinjiang, the region with the largest grape production in China, is three times the size of France.\n\nToday, there are 12 major wine regions in China, including Shandong, Beijing, Yantai, Zhangjiakou, Yibin, Tonghua, Taiyuan, Xinjiang and Ningxia, with a total of over 200 wineries.\n\nChina-produced wine has developed so much that Macau-based hotel group Wynn recently held its first Wynn Signature Chinese Wine Awards.\u2018I was taught by a counterfeiter\u2019: how an expert wine fraud detector works\n\nThe awards ceremony, held on April 13, was attended by 500 international wine enthusiasts, winemakers, industry experts and media, and showcased the finest wines China has to offer.\n\nThe judging process saw a panel of 27 international wine judges, including seven masters of wine and three master sommeliers, conduct blind tastings of more than 700 submissions from nearly 200 wineries.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Yohann Jousselin (@yohannjousselinms)\n\n\u201cChinese wines are still a tiny industry in the food and beverage universe, but if you just look at it now compared to 10 years ago, it\u2019s a completely different story,\u201d says Gus Zhu, a master of wine who took part in the three-day judging.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m optimistic that it will always grow, and it will become more and more interesting and steadily become a sustainable business.\u201d\n\nZhu explains how several Chinese regions have switched their attention to the wine industry.\n\n\u201cTake Ningxia for example: its biggest agricultural product used to be goji berries but because fewer people of the younger generation believed in traditional Chinese medicine any more, the demand for goji berries was on the decline.\n\n\u201cSo the government brought in consultants and asked universities, in search of new agricultural products for the province. So they decided that they can grow grapes and turn them into valuable alcoholic products.\u201d\n\nNingxia has the first and only provincial-level development bureau for wine in China, and the industry occupies the most important position in the economic development of the region.I recently tried an excellent pinot noir [from Ningxia] that went well with Sichuan food. It was quite a surpriseJust Wong, executive beverage director, Chef Tam\u2019s Seasons, Wynn Palace\n\nJust Wong, executive beverage director of Chef Tam\u2019s Seasons at Wynn Palace in Macau, is stunned by the quality of Ningxia wines.\n\n\u201cThe region was the first to start producing grapes [in China] and has received the most support from the government. They operate on a different level there. I\u2019ve been to many vineyards in my career but the technology used at Xige Estate in Ningxia blew me away,\u201d Wong says.\n\n\u201cThis winery was built very quickly and has all the necessary hardware, with a formal tasting room, hotel rooms and facilities for a master class. They have a monitoring room that feeds live data about the moisture of the soil, the wind speed and cask information. The winemaker showed me that all this data was available in an app on his phone.\u201d\n\nHowever, harvesting an agricultural product that is not native to a region has its drawbacks.\n\n\u201cThe main challenge is scaling up because of the climate,\u201d Zhu says. \u201cThere is a monsoon season in Shandong, so some years if you have a lot of rainfall during the ripening season, you have a lot of disease pressure and the quality will suffer.\n\n\u201cIn other places, like Ningxia, you need to bury vines in wintertime to survive the harsh winter temperatures, but some of the vines could still die. That is why we\u2019re focusing on quality wines but on a smaller scale.\u201d\n\nThe awards crowned Fei Tswei Marselan Reserve 2021 as China\u2019s best wine. It also earned the titles of best red wine, best wine made with the marselan grape, and best wine of Ningxia.\n\nThe Xige Estate N28 Chardonnay 2021 was named the best white wine and best value wine, while the Domaine Franco-Chinois Petit Manseng 2018 claimed the titles of best sweet wine, best wine made with the petit manseng grape, and best of North China.\n\nTo celebrate the inaugural awards, Wynn will host the Wynn Signature Chinese Wine Month in May. Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace guests can sample the award-winning wines, either as accompaniments to specially curated tasting menus at the resort\u2019s dining venues or in tasting flights at its various bars.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Corinne Mui \u2022 Wine lover (@corinnemui)\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s interesting that while Italian restaurants will promote Italian wines, Portuguese restaurants will promote Portuguese wines and so on, Chinese food is always paired with international wines,\u201d Wong says. \u201cBy the same logic, Chinese wines should also be paired with Chinese cuisines.\n\n\u201cThe problem is accessibility. If I opened a Chinese restaurant in the UK or Australia, it would be very difficult to access Chinese wines. This is a void in the market that needs to be filled.\u201d\n\nWong adds that the Ningxia region has matured to the point where winemakers are experimenting with different grapes.China-Australia wine trade to resume as Beijing nixes tariffs after 3 years\n\n\u201cI recently tried an excellent pinot noir that went well with Sichuan food. It was quite a surprise,\u201d he says, noting the challenge of pairing spicy cuisine with wines.\n\n\u201cI really hope that with events like the Wynn Signature Chinese Wine Awards, we can bring the advances Chinese wines have made to the forefront and that we\u2019ll see more Chinese wines around the world.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/25/ec3a6172-f1f8-4dfe-b885-bd4ce35e4ed0_078086de.jpg?itok=h5z_FZZb", "eventUri": "eng-9513520", "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452042326, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b15"}

These include USA, UK, Japan, France, Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany, Italy, and South Korea. From there, you will inherit a pre-elected cabinet, who will have their own biases and opinions from the previous leader. It is then up to you to determine your chosen country's future. Introduce new policies, tweak existing bills, react to developing events, and look to gain the momentum in the polls from the public. You'll have years to create your legacy - will it be one to remember as you get re-elected or one to forget as it ends in disappointment?\n\nAs leader, you will be asked to comment on situations which have achieved headline status in the press. Depending on the direction your government has gone in so far, how you deal with these can impact how the public feel you handle unforeseen events and times of crisis. With you beginning to make your mark on the country you are overseeing, some people will get behind you and others won't agree with the decisions you have made. This may even be taken to the extremes as you can experience assassination attempts and other challenges throughout your tenure. If you can make it to the end of your time in office, you will have to lay out a manifesto to show voters what the future will look like for them if you are re-elected.

Sign up here.\n\nIn-the-know Pinot Noir lovers with an eye on Sonoma are familiar with the likes of Williams Selyem, Hirsch Vineyards, and Flowers Vineyard & Winery, but many would be surprised to learn that each has been made at some point by the same winemaker: Ross Cobb. It's equally remarkable to find out that Cobb has been quietly producing his own wine, Cobb, since 2001. Cobb specializes in Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Riesling made with grapes from his family's Coastlands vineyard in the Sonoma Coast AVA as well as others in the area.\n\nThree miles inland from the Pacific, Coastlands is home to some of Sonoma County's oldest Pinot Noir vines, which were planted in 1989 by Cobb's parents, David and Diane. The former sheep farm sits at 1,150 feet above sea level and is divided into four blocks known for low yields of powerful Pinot Noir. Within a few years the family was selling grapes to high-profiled neighbors as well as to Williams Selyem, which bottled Coastlands Pinot Noir as a single vineyard expression for many years.\n\nAfter studying agroecology with a specialty in soil science at the University of Santa Cruz, Cobb began work at Ferrari-Carano in 1994 and launched the first soil lab there. Four years later he was hired by Burt Williams and Ed Selyem and took on the roles of viticulturist and enologist at their eponymous Russian River Valley winery. He moved to Flowers in 2000 and began making Cobb with his parents in 2001, remaining at Flowers for another eight vintages. In 2009, Cobb assumed the role of head winemaker at the newly launched Hirsch, where he worked for six years.\n\nMeanwhile, his parents had made a name for their wines in the Bay Area by targeting the best San Francisco restaurants listed in the Zagat guide and personally making sales calls. Without a distributor, Cobb was soon sold in 120 area eateries, and shortly thereafter it launched its direct-to-consumer business, using mailers to spread the word and their home fax machine to receive orders. While lovingly crafting his own wines and those of his employers, Ross made great connections with other vineyard owners and brought grapes from a select handful of cold-climate single vineyards into the Cobb portfolio.\n\nCobb describes his wines as being \"very true to the site and providing a sense of place, similar to Burgundy.\" In addition to that esteemed region, which he has been to 14 times, Cobb has also visited winemaking areas in Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and all corners of France. He credits this travel with helping him in his winemaking career, telling us, \"My research and discoveries brought back from these trips allowed me to dive deep into the Coastlands soils, microclimate, and viticulture, and my winemaking in response.\" He calls Pinot Noir a lens and reflection of its terroir and aims for -- and achieves -- \"complex, earthy, and spicy\" Pinot Noirs, all of which have alcohol levels of between 12.5 and 13.5 percent.\n\nCold soaks, partial whole cluster fermentation with native yeast, and 22 months in mostly older French barrels with a minimum of new oak yield an elegant, restrained style that is much more in line with examples from Burgundy than the over-extracted style that Sonoma can be known for. Cobb attributes his time at Flowers and Hirsch with the ability to experiment with whole cluster ferments, different fermentation styles, techniques like punch downs and pump overs, and the ability to work with a variety of French oak sources and different coopers to learn what oak was best suited for his style of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. He's also grateful to the many German winemaking interns he has mentored over the years, who introduced him to great Riesling that he now farms and makes into three vineyard-designate bottlings.\n\nIn addition to Coastlands, Cobb also owns two other Sonoma Coast sites, Abigail's Vineyard and Doc's Ranch, and leases and farms several other sites throughout the AVA. In addition, it sources fruit from a few vineyards a little farther north in Mendocino. The pinnacle of its portfolio is the trio of wines from its original site: Cobb Coastlands Vineyard Pinot Noir, Cobb Diane Cobb Coastlands Vineyard Pinot Noir, and Cobb Coastlands Vineyard Old Firs Block Pinot Noir. The Diane Cobb block is named for Cobb's mother, one of the vineyard and winery cofounders, who passed away in 2006, while Old Firs takes its name from the Douglas firs on the site. Cobb says Coastland's soils owe their origins to an ancient tidal pool, and that while this deep, sandy, clay loam is usually eroded, thin, and rocky, here they are rich and fertile thanks to the elevation. There is also a \"marine inversion\" effect, so the vineyard sees warm weather when it's cold in the valley and cool temperatures when it's hot inland, which aids in ripening and maintaining freshness.\n\nSoils, elevation, climate, eight different clones of Pinot Noir, an incredible vintage, and the winemaker's hand combined to create an outstanding trio of releases from Cobb in 2021. There are subtle differences among the three, but there is a delicious through line of bold red berries, touches of spice, earthiness, and florality, sumptuous tannins, and vivid acidity.

In a major coup for the UAE hosts of the Summit, the Fund immediately secured around $700m from governments, which is now set to be awarded to those countries facing some of the most severe climate-related losses.\n\nHowever, campaigners have warned the funding to date equates to a tiny fraction of the losses and damages climate vulnerable have already faced and as such a long term mechanism is urgently required to ensure the fund is adequately financed.\n\nThe Loss and Damage Fund Board meeting also comes as the hosts of this year's COP29 Climate Summit in Azerbaijan last week reiterated the need for a deal to be reached in Baku to ensure flows of climate finance into developing economies continue to increase beyond 2025.\n\nToday's report calculates that if introduced in OECD countries in 2024 at a low initial rate of $5 per tonne of CO2e before then increasing by $5 per tonne each year, a Climate Damages Tax could raise a total of $900bn by 2030, equating to $720bn for the Loss and Damage Fund and a $180bn domestic dividend.\n\nIf introduced solely in G7 states, where a considerable number of international oil and gas companies are based, the tax could raise $540bn for the Loss and Damage Fund by the end of the decade, with a $135n domestic dividend for national climate action across the G7.\n\nDavid Hillman, director of Stamp Out Poverty and co-author of the report with Dr Sindra Sharma, said: \"Finally, the international community has agreed to financial support for people at the sharp end of catastrophic climate change. It would be unforgivable if they fail to deliver the money needed. The Climate Damages Tax paper shows that the funds are there. It demonstrates that the richest, most economically powerful countries, with the greatest historical responsibility for climate change, need look no further than their fossil fuel industries to collect tens of billions a year in extra income by taxing them far more rigorously. This is surely the fairest way to boost revenues for the Loss & Damage Fund to ensure that it is sufficiently financed as to be fit for purpose.\"\n\nAreeba Hamid, joint executive director at Greenpeace UK, said there was a compelling moral and economic case for a tax on fossil fuel extraction. \"Governments cannot continue to sit back and let ordinary people pick up the bill for climate change while oil bosses line their pockets and cash in on high energy prices,\" she said. \"We need concerted global leadership to force the fossil fuel industry to stop drilling and start paying for the damage they are causing around the world. A Climate Damages Tax would be a powerful tool to help achieve both aims: unlocking hundreds of billions of funding for those at the sharp end of the climate crisis while helping accelerate a rapid and just transition away from fossil fuels around the world.\"\n\nThe proposals will face fierce opposition from the fossil fuel industry, which has long argued carbon taxes drive up energy costs for consumers.\n\nHowever, the report forms part of a trend which has seen a growing number of governments around the world back proposals for new taxes and financial reforms to help boost flows of climate finance into developing economies.\n\nJust last week, Ministers from Brazil, Germany, South Africa and Spain backed proposals for a minimum two per cent wealth tax on the world's 3,000 billionaires, in order to raise \u00a3250bn to fund development and decarbonisation projects in climate vulnerable nations. The proposals are set to be put on the agenda for the upcoming G20 Summit in Brazil and are likely to be further promoted by South Africa when it hosts the G20 next year.\n\nMeanwhile, support is growing for the Bridgetown Agenda reforms championed by Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, which include proposals to boost climate finance through multilateral development banks and new taxes on polluting activities.\n\n\"Despite being the main cause of the climate crisis, the fossil fuel industry has avoided responsibility for decades,\" said Colin Besaans from Power Shift Africa. \"Most global policy has remained focused on demand-side emissions reduction efforts for end users, while leaving the concentrated power of the fossil fuel suppliers largely untouched. In fact, rather than meaningful taxation, the fossil fuel industry has continued to enjoy government subsidies to the tune of billions of dollars globally. The Climate Damage Tax proposal is a crucial effort to help turn this unsustainable tide by squarely recognising the responsibility for polluters to pay for the problem they create, perpetuate, and profit from. We need to see fossil fuels phased out completely - strong and ratcheting taxation of the industry can help us get there.\"\n\nYou can now sign up to attend the fifth annual Net Zero Festival, which will be hosted by BusinessGreen on October 22-23 at the Business Design Centre in London.", "source": {"uri": "businessgreen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessGreen"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_murray@businessgreen.com", "name": "James Murray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/021df68/270c0cf4-ab50-437c-b3bb-7660c7d6cb5f/6/iStock-1317407382-600x315.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9522382", "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 452041738, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b1b"}

His judgment that Labour is more committed to socialist policies is undoubtedly correct, but it does not disguise the bald truth that the Tories have abandoned Conservatism.\n\nNone of this helps me decide who to vote for in the forthcoming election. The Conservatives are a spent force, while the Labour Party would take us back to a 1970s Britain of union power stifling nationalised industries, which would be in further decline because the Labour Treasury would deny them funds to invest. The illiberal and undemocratic Liberal Democrats cannot be forgiven for proposing to ignore the result of the referendum and cancel Brexit, and Reform's naive policies would reduce taxation but increase government spending. I feel that the party also carries a nasty vein of populism. Help!\n\nAndrew Dyke\n\nLondon N21\n\nSIR - While I agree with much of Lord Frost's article (\"British politics as we know it is broken. Here's how we Conservatives must rebuild it\", April 27), I think he's over-optimistic if he believes that the Tory party can ever revert to true Conservative principles.\n\nI am considering switching my vote to Reform UK, and would encourage true Conservatives to do the same for both the upcoming council elections then the general election later.\n\nThe modern Tory party appeals to no one as it's become little more than a machine for attaining power - and now the machine is itself broken. A party with no basic principles does not deserve to survive.\n\nStephen Phillips\n\nLondon W11\n\nSIR - When will Conservative backbenchers learn that the cycle of replacing their leader (\"Tory rebels on warpath after MP defects to Labour\", report, April 28) will fail to win over the British electorate, as it shows that they have no concept of the importance of loyalty?\n\nHon Ian MacGregor\n\nLondon N2\n\nSIR - Dan Poulter is now a Labour MP, representing a constituency in which 35,000 voted for the Conservative Party, with a majority of more than 23,000.\n\nThere is not long to go before the next general election, which will provide the good folk of Suffolk Central and Ipswich North, Dr Poulter's constituency, an opportunity to once again be represented by the party for which they voted. Surely it is time the situation that allows MPs to change allegiance should be repealed.\n\nDenis Kearney\n\nLostwithiel, Cornwall\n\nDefence commitment\n\nSIR - While the Prime Minister's announcement to increase defence spending by \u00a375 billion is welcome (Letters, April 28), if the polls are to be believed it is unlikely that he will be in a position to implement it.\n\nWords come cheap, actions are much more expensive. If we are to increase defence expenditure to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2030, we now need Sir Keir Starmer to commit the Labour Party to the same course of action. Unless that happens, it is just more rhetoric.\n\nGp Capt G R James (retd)\n\nDuquesa, M\u00e1laga, Spain\n\nSIR - I am not the least surprised that there is a serious shortfall in the number of people applying to join our Armed Forces (Letters, April 25). The recruitment system is abysmal and needs a complete overhaul.\n\nHaving waited six months for an interview, which was held online by an outside agency, my grandson - who is highly qualified and from a family of servicemen - was turned down by the Royal Navy. Whatever happened to in-person interviews, where candidates can be properly assessed?\n\nHilary C Young\n\nHadleigh, Suffolk\n\nOfsted rulings\n\nSIR - Ofsted, despite much evidence and advice, has decided to retain one-word inspection judgments (Letters, April 27). Any school is, by its very nature, a complex organisation, and it is insulting and misleading to sum up an inspection in one word.\n\nI was a headteacher for 20 years and in that time I experienced many inspections (all of them successful). Never did I feel that one word was sufficient to adequately sum up the inspector's findings. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that there is a shortage of teachers in this country.\n\nMike Aston\n\nStourbridge, Worcestershire\n\nRail closures\n\nSIR - John Turner (Letters, April 27) refers to \"the Tory closure of far too much of the network\". Harold Macmillan was the \"villain\" who commissioned Richard Beeching to write a report on railway closures, which ultimately saved just \u00a330 million.\n\nHowever, it was Labour's Barbara Castle who closed more than 2,000 miles of railway, including the Varsity Line against the advice of Dr Beeching. It is now sensibly being reinstated as East West Rail.\n\nRodney Enderby\n\nKings Sutton, Northamptonshire\n\nRum memories\n\nSIR - When we were young, my ex-Navy father's remedy for flu was two extra blankets on the bed, a hot-water bottle and a glass of hot milk and rum (Letters, April 27). This worked well as a cure, but I still have a deep hatred of even the smell of rum.\n\nJames Rand\n\nLancing, West Sussex\n\nSIR - My family lived in Kenya when I was a child, where many items were difficult or impossible to obtain, and this included most standard medical items. I was therefore treated with a combination of Cointreau for all conditions from the naval upwards, and brandy for anything from the waist downwards.\n\nI suffered no ill effects, but I was a little surprised by the reaction of the school nurse I told when we returned to the UK.\n\nSusan Dudley-Smith\n\nWheldrake, North Yorkshire\n\nClassical dilemmas\n\nSIR - In an age where attention spans seem to be getting ever shorter, as technology distracts us more and more from focusing on the task in hand, I would question the wisdom of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (BCSO) in allowing the use of phones to photograph and record its concerts (report, April 26).\n\nThis will undoubtedly disturb seasoned concert-goers and professional musicians, as was proved by tenor Ian Bostridge's recent refusal to continue to sing amid the distractions.\n\nIt should instead hold a series of short, introductory concerts, specially designed for those unfamiliar with the world of classical music. The performers could explain the instruments, how they work, and the background to the pieces and their composers in interesting ways than could be related to everyday life.\n\nSurely this would be preferable to turning a concert into something more resembling a press conference. In doing so, the BCSO will lose the loyalty of its regular punters and possibly even the newcomers who, with the highlights captured on their phones, may well not see a need to return.\n\nRos Groves\n\nWatford, Hertfordshire\n\nSIR - The obituary of Michael Tanner (April 24) mentions that he eventually \"came to detest\" the Hallelujah Chorus of George Frideric Handel's Messiah. Many will share his feelings.\n\nQuite by chance, on the same day recently the excellent Bach Before Seven on Radio 3 broadcast Johann Sebastian Bach's Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden BWV 230\" (Praise the Lord, all ye nations). The hallelujah chorus there, which dances along beautifully, is to my ears far more attractive.\n\nI seem to be continuing the debate initiated by Samuel Butler more than a century ago as to which of these composers was superior.\n\nBernard Richards\n\nBrasenose College, University of Oxford\n\nMurderously good\n\nSIR - At dinner parties, we often play \"can you name a film that is better than the book\". It is surprisingly difficult, probably because the director visualises it differently to readers, who invariably have strong feelings about how the characters look and act.\n\nHopefully this will not be the case with Richard Osman's bestseller The Thursday Murder Club (report, April 24), which is being made into a star-studded film.\n\nDavid Acklam\n\nTotland Bay, Isle of Wight\n\nPeople will always pay to visit La Serenissima\n\nSIR - Venice is trying to discourage visitors in high season by introducing a \u20ac5 entrance fee for day-trippers, a move a former mayor described as \"absurd\" (\"Ex-mayor urges tourists not to pay fee to enter Venice\", report, telegraph.co.uk, April 24), as they are already overcharged for restaurants and public transport.\n\nMore than 30 years ago, sitting at a table in St Mark's Square, I paid \u00a37 for a coffee in Caff\u00e8 Florian. I would have paid double to have soaked up the history of what is the oldest coffee house in Italy, with its glorious interior, not to mention\n\nthe perfect views of St Mark's Basilica. There was even a member of our Royal family sitting at the next table.\n\nFinancial penalties will not stop the flow of tourists to this unique Unesco World Heritage Site, which everyone should visit once in their lifetime. There is no high season.\n\nMartin Henry\n\nGood Easter, Essex\n\nIt's not just the elderly who miss public lavatories\n\nSIR - Judith Woods is right to bemoan the lack of public lavatories (Letters, April 24), but this has a negative impact on a wider cross-section of the populace than merely the elderly. In London, the shortage is a major issue for taxi drivers, plumbers, carpenters, delivery drivers and countless others who work hard for the benefit of the population. It is also a source of distress for people with health problems, pregnant women and those with small children.\n\nWhere public lavatories are available, the dismal state of some of them can be exceedingly unpleasant. It is hard to believe that local councils cannot spare some pennies in order to allow others to spend theirs.\n\nFrances Luczyc Wyhowska\n\nLondon SW11\n\nSIR - I have just returned from Japan, where the first surprise was the heated seat in the airport's facilities. We found that free public lavatories were everywhere, all scrupulously clean and every one had a heated seat. There was even an occasion when the seat cover lifted itself on my entering the cubicle, almost as a form of welcome.\n\nI wonder what Japanese visitors think of our disappointing facilities?\n\nDavid Jones\n\nBarrington, Cambridgeshire\n\nSIR - My great-grandfather, John Palmer Wallis, was instrumental in the provision of ladies' lavatories in central London, doubtless encouraged by his wife. My mother was told that prior to this a lady's only option was to approach a policeman and say: \"Officer, lend me your cloak.\" She could then squat and modesty would be preserved.\n\nBill Marsh\n\nBicester, Oxfordshire\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nWe accept letters by email and post.

The show was to celebrate the band's Europe tour starting early next month and the Private Function crew decided on a Looney Toons theme with mascots and music to fit.\n\nThe theme seemed innocuous and wholesome, but on the morning of the show Private Function received a cease-and-desist letter from Warner Bros.\n\nKeep up with the latest music news, features, festivals, interviews and reviews here.\n\nPrivate Function isn't new to bureaucratic legal shenanigans; they have received multiple cease-and-desist orders over the band's lifespan, but this latest threat was by far the most daunting. Jitters aside, the band decided to push on with the gig.\n\nSerpette and Spunk opened the night up before Private Function took the stage. Inflatable pool toys flew across the stage before the band members sauntered on, opening the set loudly and with an incredible burst of caffeinated high-jinx. The band is known for their short but wildly energetic songs, which create the perfect recipe for a sweaty, hot and rough mosh pit.\n\nThis night is a clear testament to the band's energy and passion, at no point in the night did I ever feel bored or have any inkling of what was to come next. Rather, there was a constant and pervading sense of 'what the hell is going on?'\n\nAround the middle of the set, lead singer Chris Penney ran off stage, re-emerging momentarily in sloppy green pain. He'd earlier hinted that the band's legal headaches meant he wasn't able to 'green out' but in a flash Penney appeared dripping green before leaping headfirst into the audience, covering everyone and everything he touched in wet neon green paint.\n\nUpon reflection, I'm not sure if it's because I was a Private Function virgin, or because I haven't been around the traps enough, but this is the first time in my life I've had to dodge a half-naked man covered in green paint screaming about Albury Wodonga.\n\nThrough the night the mosh became increasingly intense, culminating in lead singer Penney grabbing audience members onstage and before long just under half the crowd rushed the stage for the final songs of the night S.O.S by ABBA and Fortunate Son by Creedence Clear Water Revival.\n\nI was blown away by the passion Private Function brought to The Tote - they played with a passion that is rare to see. I was impressed by how the instruments blended together in a way lacking in many punk shows; instead of a muddy mess of sound, each instrument had a clear purpose and I could hear every sound with clear definition and power.\n\nPrivate Function is by far one of the best bands that our country is offering, if you get the chance to see them live, without question you must absolutely go!

NYSE: SNAP investors are rejoicing after the company reported a surprise profit in its Q1 2024 earnings report. The company also raised its outlook for Q2 2024 as a cherry on top. After disappointing investors for the past several quarters, expectations were low. This set up a perfect storm when the company took everyone by surprise on a number of solid metrics. The computer and technology sector companies surged over 30% the following day as bears scrambled and bulls dived back in.\n\nJust the day before Snap's earnings, social media bell weather Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META reported its earnings and suffered a 10% drop in reaction. This drop caused Snap investors to assume the worst, as sympathy selling caused a gap down the following morning. Meta Platform reported very strong results.\n\nWhat scared investors was the magnitude of the jump in capex spending the company announced as the \"Year of Efficiency\" seems to have ended and replaced with heavy capex spending (again). This time, Meta noted that it is ramping up capex for its artificial intelligence (AI) application LLAMA3, not the Metaverse. Prudent investors took the opportunity to buy the dip in Snap as shares rallied nearly 3% on the day heading into the earnings report.\n\nSNAP's daily chart illustrates a rectangle pattern that formed since its previous earnings gap down of 34% on February 7, 2024. The $12.39 gap fill marks the upper flat-top trendline of the rectangle, and $10.54 is the lower flat-bottom trendline. SNAP traded between the trendlines for three months heading into its Q1 2024 earnings report. The blowout report resulted in a 30% gap up the following morning, marking $13.78 as the new upper gap fill. The daily relative strength index surged through the 70-band. Pullback support is at $13.78, $12.39, $11.55 and $10.54.\n\nSnap reported Q1 2024 non-GAAP EPS of 3 cents versus consensus estimates for a loss of 26 cents, beating estimates by 29 cents. The net loss was still $305 million vs. $329 million in the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million versus $1 million last year. Revenues surged 21% YoY to $1.2 billion versus $1.12 consensus estimates. It's worth noting that the comparison to Q1 2023 was a low bar since it was the first quarter that Snap had reported a revenue decline.\n\nNorth American revenues saw 16% YoY growth, expanding 14 points higher QoQ. Rose of World (ROW) and Europe grew at a faster pace due to the adverse impact of the Middle East conflicts in the quarter.\n\nSnap guided up Q2 revenues to $1.225 billion to $1.255 billion versus $1.22 billion consensus estimates. DAU is expected to grow to 431 million, and adjusted EBITDA is forecast between $15 million and $45 million.\n\nSnap makes most of its revenues on advertising. Investors have waited with bated breath for the digital advertising slump to rebound, and it appears that it's underway. Advertising revenues rose 16% YoY to $1.11 billion. Snap had continually talked about restructuring its advertising platform as investors grew weary of the excuses. The cumulative effect triggered in this quarter is highlighted by the 31% YoY jump in total adjusted cost of revenues.\n\nSnap has undergone a stringent cost-cutting initiative as it cut 20% of its workforce in late 2022 and further cut another 10% of its headcount in its announcement in February 2024.\n\nSnapchat launched its new and improved version of Conversions API (CAPI) to all advertisers, which simplifies set up with less integration times. Snap partnered with Snowflake Inc. NYSE: SNOW to enable advertisers to use CAPI solutions without having to build a bespoke backend integration. The CAPI improvements have led to 300% YoY growth in CAPI integrations.\n\nSnap saw an 85% rise in active advertisers from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Direct response ads drove the surge in SMB growth as this group favors this type of advertising, which actually forces users to respond and provide feedback.\n\nSnap ramped up its AI and ML investments to support the direct response and brand-related ad platform, which saw ad revenues rise across all regions in the quarter. Snapchat+ subscribers tripled YoY, passing 9 million subscribers in the quarter. Continued investment in Generative AI models and automation to create ML and AI Lenses increased AI Lenses viewed by over 50% YoY. Snap also implemented a new AI assistant in Lens Studio to answer developer questions and guide developers through tutorials to build Lenses more easily.\n\nDaily active users (DAUs) rose 10% YoY to 422 million, an increase of 39 million users, beating analyst estimates by 1 million users. A DAU is interpreted as a registered Snapchat user who opens the Snapchat app one or more times during a defined 24-hour period. Average DAUs are calculated by taking the total DAUs each day divided by the number of days in the quarter.\n\nSnapchat reaches over 75% of the 13 to 34-year-old market in 25 countries, comprising more than 50% of the global ad market. Revenues per user also jumped 9.7% YoY in the quarter but fell 14% QoQ.\n\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel noted that Snapchat is ranked as the number one happiest platform, as 90% of its users say they feel comfortable and happy when using the platform. Spiegel talked up the success of its advertising platform, \"In Q1, ongoing momentum with our 70-pixel purchase optimization model led to a more than 75% increase in purchase-related conversions year-over-year. In addition, we are excited by the progress we're seeing with our small and medium-sized advertising partners.\"\n\nSpiegel noted that content creators and SMBs can promote their content and products with just a few taps on the Snapchat application. This has been the driving force behind the 85% YoY growth in SMB Snapchat advertisers. He pointed out that over 300 million people are engaged with augmented reality (AR) products daily, which is driving innovation.\n\nSpiegel concluded, \"We believe that our large and growing community, an innovative and engaging service that continues to evolve, and a strong balance sheet with positive free cash flow positions us well to achieve our long-term vision for augmented reality, which we believe will be one of the most meaningful advancements in computing that the world has ever seen.\"\n\nOn April 26, 2024, HSBC upgraded shares of SNAP to a Buy from Reduce.

Others have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said.\n\nAn appliance maker in southern China is finding it hard to ship its products to Russia, not because of any problems with the gadgets but because China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over U.S. sanctions. To settle payments for its electrical goods, the Guangdong-based company is considering using currency brokers active along China's border with Russia, said the company's founder, Wang, who asked to be identified only by his family name.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia and Russian entities since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. Now the threat of extending these to banks in China - a country Washington blames for \"powering\" Moscow's war effort - is chilling the finance that lubricates even non-military trade from China to Russia.\n\nThis is posing a growing problem for small Chinese exporters, said seven trading and banking sources familiar with the situation.

Since last month, Chinese banks have intensified their scrutiny of Russia-related transactions or halted business altogether to avoid being targeted by U.S. sanctions, the sources said.\n\n\"Transactions between China and Russia will increasingly go through underground channels,\" said the head of a trade body in a southeastern province that represents Chinese businesses with Russian interests. \"But these methods carry significant risks.\" Making payments in crypto, banned in China since 2021, might be the only option, said a Moscow-based Russian banker, as \"it's impossible to pass through KYC (know-your-customer) at Chinese banks, big or small\".\n\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the topic. Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes. China's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to \"the relevant authorities\".\n\nThe People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. SANCTIONS WARNING\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed \"serious concern\" that Beijing was \"powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine\". Still, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping, was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.\n\nWhile officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the U.S. preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a U.S. official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, \"China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, \"Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security. \"Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBlinken made clear to Chinese officials \"that ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest,\" the spokesperson said. \"If China does not address this problem, the United States will.\" Nearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.\n\nSome of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion. Among the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.\n\nBy contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown. 'CHANNEL CAN BE SHUT'\n\nThe four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies. Some rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.\n\nA chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name. Calls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.\n\nBOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said. The manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.\n\n\"We gave up on the Russian market,\" the manager said. \"We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.\" Wang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.\n\n\"I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,\" he said. \"What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future. The channel can be shut completely one day.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_04_32_3060217.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-9521083", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452044212, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b25"}

Public opinion in the framing of this term is usually based on the idea of writer, academics, media and intellectuals from the West who belong to a small group of people with power, authority and at times, wealth.\n\nOn many occasions when the phrase international community is used, there is a particular group that wants to get a certain position agreed on, a consensus or accord, on a 'global' issue to give it relevance and show how 'serious' the matter is.\n\nWithout being stated explicitly, the \"international community\" appears to be made up of North America (the United States and Canada), (Western) Europe, a few other nations that are unavoidable due to their strength or membership in the UN Security Council.\n\nAlso, countries with the appropriate historical, cultural, or, more specifically, racial background like Australia, Israel and New Zealand are also famed as members of this community. Despite representations as the \"international community\", when these countries deliberate, it has not always reflected that their agenda is legitimate. Or that the views of their countries' leaders do mirror the aspirations of their people, in a democratic fashion.\n\nThus, the \"international community\" worked heavily against Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2020, to give a tag to the African country as being an isolated, pariah, rogue or failed state by instigating illegal regime change activities.\n\nThe \"other community\", however, dismissed the consensus and public opinion that the so-called international community sought to establish against Zimbabwe.\n\nBased on their international alliance, this community stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" against Zimbabwe by creating narratives that promoted instability within Zimbabwe's borders. During this time, it was China, Cuba, Iran, Russia and South Africa, among others, which stood firm with Zimbabwe.\n\nThis process has been implemented by the \"international community\" against China and Russia, but have failed because the two countries, plus the US, are the only three great powers the world has, hence difficult to sideline.\n\nLikewise, there are strategic reasons why the \"international community\" is now keen on getting a consensus against Iran. These are the nations linked by a particular form of Eurocentrism, if not outright racism, that can also be interpreted as ethno-tribalism.\n\nWestern media, which carries traditional hostility Iran, has in the past few weeks trying to enrage the world against Iran as a policy of \"Persian hatred\" that was started by former US president Donald Trump.\n\nThe hatred has been thick such that the USA has always wanted an opportunity to \"obliterate Iran\". This ought to be seen in the context that the US-led \"international community\" which has repeatedly used the threat of nuclear weapons against Iran.\n\nAt last year's 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a dark warning to Tehran, threatening the country with a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Above all, Iran must face a credible nuclear threat,\" said Netanyahu.\n\nThis nuclear threat that the Israeli authorities later retracted saying Netanyahu had misspoken, is now viewed as war policy along the grain of this long anti-Iran history. Like President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly advocated for the \"obliteration of Iran\", which essentially means use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nFor instance, in May 2019, President Trump wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that \"if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran\".\n\nIn other posts, President Trump said that the United States would attack Iran with \"great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration\". These threats are genocidal in nature.\n\nBecause of these constant genocidal threats towards Iran, it becomes evident that other great powers take notice, hence China and Russia have and had no alternative but to move towards Iran as moral towers to diffuse the likely propensity by the \"international community\" bloc to use nuclear weapons. They have used nuclear weapons before. This is also important to ensure that Iran is not \"isolated\" because it is a regional power in south-west Asia to build a new alliance of strategic cooperation.\n\nIn Chinese and Russian official media outlets, Iran's support has been formalised and given out with certainty. Against Iran, China has condemned the use of the US' \"long-arm jurisdiction\".\n\nThe long-arm jurisdiction treacherously permits the United States to contend that it has the authority to bring legal action against other nations based on domestic legislation rather than international law.\n\nThis US conceit has been so since the collapse of the USSR, a set of states including Zimbabwe and Iran, have faced the brunt of US force being called rogue states, pariah states, failed states and even labelled state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nTo try and separate China and Russia from Iran, key facts that need to be kept in mind include that the US imposed economic pressure on China leading to a trade war. Secondly, the US also deliberately destroyed relations with Russia, sanctioning the country and expanding NATO eastwards and threatening Russia's security leading to a special military operation in Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, the US' waging of economic warfare against Iran through sanctions heavily impacts China and other countries that will have difficulties to purchase Iran's oil and to continue normal trade.\n\nSuch pressures have brought convergence to China, Iran and Russia in their resoluteness to defend the rest of the world against a racially skewed \"international community\" that only favours the US-led narratives that are detrimental to the interests of others.\n\nThis triad attraction and convergence is cementing as a reaction to the pressure from the West. US behaviour has initiated the speed at which this convergence has been made to enable increased future ties.\n\nIt should be therefore known that the \"international community\" is nothing but a bloc driven by westomania. This is among other reasons why the China-Iran-Russia triad is converging because if any of the three countries falter, the \"other community\" will also falter.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Israels-Prime-Minister-Bi-007.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520856", "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 452043883, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b27"}

You've heard of them, right?\n\nWith an unremarkable par on the first playoff hole, they took the title over Martin Trainer and Chad Ramey, who had been waiting around for nearly three hours to see if the 63 they'd teamed up to shoot would be good enough for sudden death.\n\nIt's a tumultuous time in progressional golf, and this has been a tough year for the PGA Tour, marked by flagging TV viewership and less-than-folkloric Sunday finishes. Before Scottie Scheffler began his torrid stretch of play with a victory at the Bay Hill, in March, four first-timer winners had prevailed in the first nine events of the season.\n\nAs the final round got underway in Louisiana, the team-format Zurich Classic seemed poised to deliver more of the same. The leaderboard was not exactly Hall of Fame. On the strength of a Saturday best ball 65, Zac Blair and Patrick Fishburn, childhood pals from Utah and fellow BYU alums with a total of zero Tour career wins between them, were the front runners at 23-under, followed by pairings that included Luke List and Henrik Norlander, Mark Hubbard and Ryan Brehm, and Nico Echavarria and Max Greyserman.\n\nThe outliers near the top were McIlroy and Lowry, in a tie for third at 21-under. This was McIlroy's first appearance at the Zurich, and event that he and Lowry decided they should play in after a \"drunken lunch\" celebrating their victory with Team Europe in last year's Ryder Cup. Longtime pals from Northern Ireland, the two men dressed like twins all week in New Orleans, wearing matching outfits, and, often, matching grins.\n\nThey had a lot to smile about during Sunday's round of alternate-shot play, as McIlroy took advantage of his massive lengths to cut par 5s down to size while leaving his partner within pitching distance on several par 4s.\n\nAs the day wore on, the wheat separated itself from the chaff.\n\nAfter hanging tough on the front nine, Blair and Fishburn made double-bogeys on both par-3s on the back side to dash their chances. Other contenders either stalled or fell back.\n\nThe exception were Trainer and Ramey, who fired an early-day 63, an alternate-shot course record at the Zurich, to claim the clubhouse lead at 25-under, and then were forced to play the waiting game.\n\nNearly three hours later, after Mcllroy bombed a drive to set up a closing birdie for his team on the 18th, the playoff began.\n\nIt was over almost as soon as it started, as Ramey and Trainer scuffed their way toward bogey with a sequence of pulled shots and a flubbed chip, and McIlroy and Lowry made routine par.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RoryLowryZurich.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9514342", "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 452043813, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b28"}

In a report published on Friday, April 26, the German NGO European Platform for Democratic Elections (EPDE) revealed the identity of 183 foreign \"international observers and experts\" who were invited by the Russian authorities to observe the March 2024 presidential election, in which Putin was elected to a fifth term. It has been described by the European Parliament as \"illegitimate and undemocratic\" and was preceded by the death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny in a Russian prison on February 16.\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin's regime has been inviting European elected officials and media personalities to Russia in order to legitimize violations of international law (territorial annexations) and the corruption of democratic rules (rigged elections) to the Russian public and the international community alike. The foreign figures who are invited are displayed in the Russian media as a \"democratic\" endorsement of the Kremlin's actions. At the 2018 presidential elections, French observers included former ambassador to Moscow Jean Cadet, Rassemblement National (far right) MP Gilbert Collard, Union des D\u00e9mocrates Ind\u00e9pendants (center right) senator Jo\u00ebl Gu\u00e9rriau, and Thierry Mariani, who was then a member of Les R\u00e9publicains (right).\n\nAt the same time, Russian authorities have gradually reduced their tolerance of independent, qualified observers, including those from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), of which Russia is a member.

Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes.\n\nChina's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to \"the relevant authorities\".\n\nThe People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nSANCTIONS WARNING\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed \"serious concern\" that Beijing was \"powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine\".\n\nStill, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping, was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.\n\nWhile officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the U.S. preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a U.S. official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, \"China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, \"Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security.\n\n\"Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBlinken made clear to Chinese officials \"that ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest,\" the spokesperson said. \"If China does not address this problem, the United States will.\"\n\nNearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.\n\nSome of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion.\n\nAmong the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.\n\nBy contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown.\n\n'CHANNEL CAN BE SHUT'\n\nThe four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies.\n\nSome rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.\n\nA chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name.\n\nCalls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.\n\nBOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said.\n\nThe manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.\n\n\"We gave up on the Russian market,\" the manager said. \"We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.\"\n\nWang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.\n\n\"I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,\" he said.\n\n\"What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future. The channel can be shut completely one day.\"\n\n(Reporting by China bureau; Additional reporting by Simon Lewis; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and William Mallard)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/67fbbad/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F51%2F9f5012e771423cc60081d2020216d5%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK3R0BA%3A22024-04-28T232318Z_2_LYNXMPEK3R0BA_RTROPTP_3_CHINA-ECONOMICS-FOREIGN-BUSINESS.JPG", "eventUri": "eng-9521083", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 452043661, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b2b"}

The word \"veterinarian\"...\n\nAs we celebrate the 2024 World Veterinary Day in Nigeria, a brief history of our profession for institutional memory will be appropriate.\n\nThe word \"veterinarian\" is from the Latin word veterinarius and came into use in the mid-1600s. Veterinary medicine at the beginning focused mainly on the health of horse stock because horses were used for transportation, labour and powering of most machinery. The iconic name of the steam locomotive is Iron Horse. Later on, the profession progressed into food-producing animals, followed by companion animals and eventually to the environment. However, the ultimate objective of the veterinary profession is serving humanity by ensuring the availability of wholesome commodities of animal origin, caring for working and companion animals for company, therapy, sports and recreation and ensuring sustainable ecosystems. This is what veterinarians sign up for.\n\nModern veterinary medicine began with the control of Rinderpest (cattle plague). The disease rinderpest was having a field day causing massive cattle deaths leading to human destitution and deaths in rural Europe until when in the 18th century, it invaded and devastated the Papal herds. Now the whole of Europe was appalled and Pope Clement XI was alarmed by the temerity of this plague in destroying the Papal herd.\n\nAll agreed that this plague has neither respect for constituted authority nor for religion and has now crossed the red line. The virus therefore attracted the Holy See dreadful curse. Our Fela's song entitled, 'Trouble Sleep Yanga Waken Am' aptly describes the situation.\n\nPope Clement XI immediately instructed his physician, Dr Giovanni Maria Lancisi, to prescribe measures for the suppression of the plague. Lancisi concluded that it was a contagion that is exceedingly fine and pernicious particles that pass from one body to another and called it Bovilla peste. His recommendations for its containment were; 1. slaughter to reduce spread (stamping out), 2. restricted movement of cattle (quarantine), 3. burial of whole animals in lime, and 4. inspection of meat. These recommendations were made in 1713 and to date remain the core principles of infectious animal disease control in Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThis led to the creation of the first Veterinary school on 4th August 1761 in Lyon, France. The 1st class of 38 students had ages ranging from 11-30 years and were admitted in 1762. The admission requirements were: 1. ability to read and write 2. evidence of baptism 3. certificate of good conduct 4. and a most, not a physician (So the Vets and Medics rivalry started from Day 1). Thereafter many vet schools were established in Europe but in Africa, the 1st Vet School was established in Egypt in 1827 while in Nigeria the 1st Vet faculty was established at the University of Ibadan in 1963 followed by Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria in 1965. Today there are 14 Veterinary faculties in Nigeria and the Veterinary Council of Nigeria (VCN), the regulatory board of the profession has over 10,500 qualified persons recorded in its register.\n\nTo combat rinderpest in Nigeria, the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) then referred to as Veterinary Department was established in Zaria, Northern Nigeria in 1924. Coincidentally in the same year, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) later changed to Word Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) a global authority on animal health, was also established in Paris, France. Both organizations, NVRI and WOAH celebrate their centenary this year.\n\nMass vaccination and movement control were the main tools used to control rinderpest in Nigeria. Vaccination was firstly, with anti-rinderpest hyper-immune serum before the introduction of Plowright's Tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV). The field use of TCRV started in 1956 and became the main vaccine used to eradicate rinderpest. With the advent of this efficacious vaccine and a better understanding of rinderpest epidemiology, experts in 1987 predicted that rinderpest is an eradicable disease. To accomplish that, FAO-Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) was developed in 1994. That was the beginning of the end of Rinderpest.\n\nIn Nigeria, after a series of mass vaccinations, the last confirmed outbreak of rinderpest was in 1987 and vaccination was therefore stopped on 1st April 1998. Globally rinderpest vaccination was all stopped in 2006. Since rinderpest had been eradicated in Europe, China, Russia and the Far East since the 1960s, declaration of global freedom from the disease was made in 2011.\n\nRinderpest is the second infectious disease but the first animal disease eradicated from the world, smallpox being the first. In 2012 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly OIE) established FAO-WOAH Rinderpest Joint Advisory Committee (JAC); a committee of seven international experts to advise the two organisations on post-eradication activities to maintain global freedom from rinderpest. JAC operated between 2012 to 2023 and its main mandate was to track and reduce global stocks of rinderpest virus-containing material (RVCM) especially those in unsafe holding facilities. This was successfully accomplished.\n\nOn global eradication of infectious diseases, the Vets and Medics have killed one disease each, namely rinderpest and smallpox, respectively and several more to go. Already, the second professional bout has commenced with medics having a head start on a second potential kill, namely the eradication of poliomyelitis (polio) but the Vets are not too far behind with the potential for double kill, the eradication of the Peste des petits ruminant (PPR) and Rabies by 2030.\n\nLest we forget, the Nigerian Vets had a history of local killing of another disease after which we went to sleep in celebration and unfortunately, the disease resurrected with a vengeance. Avian Influenza (AI) a viral disease posing a major threat to the national poultry industry with a potential for a global pandemic was detected in Nigeria in 2006. Against all odds, the Nigerian Vets with assistance of global partners stood up to the challenge and successfully managed and eradicated AI within two years (2006-2008) to the bewilderment of many sceptics. So Nigerian Vets have a reputation for achieving a difficult task if they are committed to it. Therefore, with the same dedication, Peste des petits ruminant and Rabies, the two diseases earmarked for global eradication can suffer the same fate. So, let's keep the vets/medic rivalry because it brings the best out of the two professions which is good for humanity and the world in general.

The shutdown of the supermarket was a result of an outcry in the media over their discriminatory policy of exclusively serving Chinese nationals in the supermarket.\n\nThe owner of the supermarket, Mrs Liu Bei, denied the discriminatory practice saying that the supermarket is a small grocery shop aimed at meeting the needs of her local community. Nevertheless, discrimination in any form galls. It is worse when it is based on race. The Chinese and the black race should be on the same page on matters of racism as we have always collectively suffered the indignities of racial discrimination from white folks.\n\nMany of us who have lived in Europe and the Americas, over 40 years ago, would relate horror stories of overt racial discrimination practices in those lands. I lived in Swansea, UK, in the late 1970s and early 80s, and for the years I was there I couldn't get a flat to rent and had to contend with university accommodation. I was newly married and needed a more suitable accommodation. Whenever I spotted an advertisement for a vacant flat in the evening paper, I rushed to present myself, and I always got the same reply, 'Oh it has just been taken'. This reply became a familiar refrain. I had to draw the inevitable conclusion that I was being denied because of my race.\n\nRacism against black people, in particular, is a historical phenomenon practised by and was widespread among white folks in Europe and the Americas, obviously a concomitant of slavery and colonial subjugation. Somehow even during the hundred years of British colonial rule, Nigerians were spared the institutionalised racism that was prevalent in places like South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya. This is probably why we are slow to act on matters of racial provocation. This is not to say that the British were not racist here. There were racial discrimination practices as pertained to employment, housing and hotel accommodation here and there. It was said that some hospitals funded by the government were reserved for only Europeans.\n\nSome clubs such as Ikoyi Club, did not admit Nigerian members. Some hotels also did not accommodate black people. In all parts of the country, the British colonialists created European Reservation Areas where only their kind lived. Up North, the housing discriminatory acts were not an issue because the white officials were not overtly visible. They ruled by proxy, a la indirect rule, through the emirs and chiefs. It was in the South, particularly in Lagos where direct colonial rule had rooted itself since the mid-19th Century, that some of these racist practices were contested by Nigerians.\n\nMany Nigerians of a certain age would readily recall the 1947 racial discrimination incident that occurred at Hotel Bristol, Lagos. Ivor Cummings, a Sierra-Leonean who was an official of the Colonial Office, visited Lagos in April 1947 and was denied accommodation at the Bristol Hotel owned by a Greek, even though the Nigerian government had arranged to have him stay there. Hotel Bristol was one of the top hotels of that era. The name Cummings befuddled the hotel owners who thought that he was a white man. However, when he presented himself at the reception and they realised he was black they refused to entertain him.\n\nThis caused quite an uproar, particularly among the Lagos elite who had started to challenge the colonial government on sundry matters. The elite quickly mobilised the burgeoning political associations and the labour unions. The hotel was attacked and ransacked. The colonial government saw the writing on the wall making the Governor-General, Sir Authur Richards, to hold a meeting with representatives of the Lagos elite. After the meeting, the governor-general issued wide-ranging measures effectively removing all aspects of overt racism. European hospitals and clubs were renamed and became accessible to Nigerians.\n\nThe European Hospital in Lagos (now Military Hospital) and European Club at Ikoyi were renamed Creek Hospital and Ikoyi Club respectively. The European hospital at Warri was changed to Maple Annex. The European Hospital at Ibadan was changed to Jericho Nursing Home. Areas throughout the country otherwise known as European Reservations were renamed Government Reserve Areas (GRA). It is remarkable that this singular protest caused the colonial government to make those sweeping changes in its policy.\n\nWe hope the swift action taken by the FCCPC will not only stop at shutting down the Chinese supermarket. They should also be made to face the laws of the land. Furthermore, the FCCPC should also beam its searchlight to all those nooks and corners where these kinds of despicable acts of racism take place. Already there are reports of an Indian school in Ilupeju, Lagos, where for years Nigerian children have been denied admission. The issue has gone viral and the FCCPC must investigate it to stamp out these unholy practices in our land. Racism should have no place here.", "source": {"uri": "dailytrust.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Trust"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 452043569, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b2e"}

Today, the 71-year-old Nigerian billionaire celebrates his birthday as a symbol of his continued impact and creativity, JUSTICE OKAMGBA writes\n\nOne of the few Nigerians on this year's Forbes World Billionaires list is Mike Adenuga. He is currently the second wealthiest man in Nigeria, having made his mark in the banking, real estate, oil and gas, telecommunications, and aviation industries. Adenuga epitomises a self-made man.\n\nBorn on April 29, 1953, in Ibadan, Nigeria, to Oloye Michael Agbolade Adenuga Snr. and Omoba Juliana Oyindamola Adenuga, Mike Adenuga's journey began in humble surroundings, with his father a schoolteacher and his mother a businesswoman.\n\nHis educational journey began at Ibadan Grammar School, and he then earned his higher school certificate from Comprehensive High School Aiyetoro.\n\nDespite his modest beginnings, Adenuga's determination propelled him forward. He worked tirelessly as a taxi driver to fund his university education.\n\nHe graduated from Northwestern Oklahoma State University and Pace University with degrees in Business Administration before pursuing an MBA at Pace University in New York.\n\nAdenuga attributes much of his success to his mother's influence, acknowledging her role in shaping his formidable work ethic.\n\nAt 26, his relentless drive struck gold. His diverse business ventures culminated in his first million dollars, a stepping stone to his grand ambitions.\n\nHis business acumen is undeniable, as reflected in his estimated net worth of $6.7bn by Forbes. But Adenuga's legacy extends beyond wealth. He is a true inspiration, demonstrating the power of hard work, vision, and an unwavering entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nHis diverse portfolio spans telecommunications (Globacom), oil exploration (Conoil Plc), banking (Sterling Bank), real estate (Cobble-Stone Properties), and construction (Julius Berger). Adenuga is a true \"Jack of all trades\" and a \"master of all\".\n\nTelecoms\n\nAdenuga's fearless approach to risk-taking was evident when he delved into the telecommunications industry race after Nigeria opened its doors to GSM licenses.\n\nDespite initial setbacks, his determination remained unwavering. Eventually, in 2003, he successfully secured a license and launched Globacom.\n\nBy 2001, Adenuga had already established himself as a prominent figure in Nigeria's economy. When the opportunity arose with the Obasanjo administration offering GSM licenses, he naturally joined the competition. Despite facing a setback and losing $20m in the process, Adenuga was resolute.\n\nHis persistence paid off handsomely as he returned stronger, securing a license that paved the way for Globacom's emergence as a future national telecom leader.\n\nLaunched in 2003 with the ambition to become Nigeria's telecom giant, Globacom swiftly established itself as a game-changer under Adenuga's astute leadership.\n\nDespite entering the market two years after its competitors, the company, propelled by Adenuga's vision, became known for its innovative approaches.\n\nIt championed per-second billing, a revolutionary concept that democratised phone usage for Nigerians, solidifying Globacom's status as a trailblazer in the telecommunications industry.\n\nGlobacom, with over 60 million subscribers, has continually pushed boundaries in the telecommunications industry, pioneering various network technologies such as 2.5G, 3G, and 4G LTE.\n\nConstantly setting new standards, Globacom has been at the forefront of innovation.\n\nOne of its most significant achievements was the launch of Glo-1, a groundbreaking intercontinental submarine cable project that transformed internet connectivity in Nigeria.\n\nWith a staggering investment of $250m, solely funded by Globacom, Glo-1 marked the first of its kind in Africa.\n\nStretching over 9,800 kilometres, the cable links Nigeria to Europe and America, with landing points along the West African coast and Europe.\n\nThis monumental infrastructure upgrade significantly enhanced internet speed and reliability for voice, data, and video services.\n\nBeyond its impact on individual users, Glo-1 provided vital connectivity for key sectors such as oil and gas, banking, and education.\n\nThis transformative project underscores Adenuga's foresight and dedication to shaping Nigeria's technological landscape.\n\nDespite the chaos that ensued a few months ago due to a major cut in submarine cables, telecommunications subscribers across Nigeria and several other African countries found themselves in a state of panic.\n\nThere were reports that the outage, which affected internet users in South and West Africa, might continue for several weeks. Among those significantly affected were banks and telecom organisations, heavily reliant on those cables for internet services.\n\nHowever, amid the turmoil, Globacom subscribers remained unaffected. They continued to enjoy uninterrupted internet connectivity and other services throughout the outage.\n\nThis resilience serves as a testament to the strength and foresight of Globacom, a company that has made substantial investments in infrastructure development.\n\nSuch an achievement directly reflects the vision of Adenuga, the founder and chairman of Globacom.\n\nHis forward-thinking approach to prioritising infrastructure has firmly positioned the company as a dependable service provider, capable of weathering unforeseen disruptions with ease\n\nOil and gas\n\nHis influence extends beyond the realm of telecommunications; he is also a significant figure in Nigeria's oil and gas industry. Adenuga saw an opportunity when Gen. Ibrahim Babangida's (retd.) administration opened the door for indigenous participation.\n\nDespite initial hesitations, Adenuga boldly invested over $100m in exploration and drilling activities.\n\nHis gamble paid off in 1991 when Consolidated Oil, his company, achieved a historic milestone by becoming the first Nigerian company to discover and produce oil in commercial quantities.\n\nToday, Conoil Producing Limited, formerly Consolidated Oil, stands as a trailblazer in Africa's indigenous oil and gas exploration and production sector.\n\nThis pioneering spirit continued as Adenuga identified potential in the National Oil and Chemical Company. He acquired the company, infused it with fresh investments, and rebranded it as Conoil Plc.\n\nConoil's success story is remarkable. It has become a household name in Nigeria, boasting a network of over 450 retail outlets across the country.\n\nAdenuga's vision and strategic investments have solidified Conoil's position as a key player in Nigeria's oil and gas landscape\n\nIt is a leader in modern retail formats, including mega stations and non-space pumps, and holds the top spot in the aviation fuel market.\n\nHis leadership has propelled Conoil Producing to operate six promising oil blocks in the Niger Delta, with a daily production of approximately 20,000 barrels.\n\nIts 27-year track record is further bolstered by substantial oil reserves, estimated in millions of barrels, and vast gas reserves in trillions of cubic feet.\n\nAdenuga's significant stake (74.4 per cent) in Conoil Plc underscores his commitment to the company's continued success.\n\nConoil's strong market presence is built on its expertise in supplying a wide range of petroleum products, from petrol and diesel to kerosene and aviation fuel.\n\nIts \"Quatro\" brand of lubricants is another testament to its diversified product line.\n\nBanking\n\nAdenuga's foray into banking began with the establishment of Devcom Bank and Equitorial Trust Bank. Both institutions became trailblazers in their fields, contributing significantly to the development of the public, commercial, and retail sectors.\n\nTheir financial strength shone brightly during the 2005 banking consolidation exercise. ETB effortlessly met the N25bn capital requirement, a testament to its stability and avoiding the need for a stock market offering.\n\nThis achievement solidified their position as major players in the Nigerian financial landscape.\n\nHowever, Adenuga's vision extended beyond individual success. Recognising the potential for further consolidation, he orchestrated the strategic merger of ETB and Devcom Bank, which laid the groundwork for an even more formidable presence in the industry.\n\nYears later, the merged entity consolidated further, joining forces with Sterling Bank Plc.\n\nToday, Adenuga remains a significant shareholder of the resulting behemoth, Sterling Financial Holding.\n\nThis publicly traded giant, a testament to Adenuga's astute financial strategy, operates two key subsidiaries: Sterling Bank Plc, a cornerstone of traditional commercial banking services in Nigeria, and Alternative Bank Limited, a pioneering force in Nigeria's non-interest banking sector that offers innovative financial solutions.\n\nAviation\n\nThe billionaire businessman is also playing actively in Nigeria's aviation sector. His company, Conoil, boasts an aviation arm, Conoil Aviation, actively involved in the aviation sector.\n\nConoil Aviation plays a key role in keeping Nigerian airplanes fuelled. It handles the entire process, from production and storage to transportation and delivery of jet fuel in at least six major airports across the country: Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja; Margaret Ekpo International Airport, Calabar; Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano; Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos; Maiduguri International Airport, and Sokoto airport.\n\nHis foundation\n\nBeyond his accomplishments in business, Adenuga is also well-known for his generosity and unwavering commitment to philanthropy.\n\nHis altruistic efforts have touched the lives of countless individuals and celebrities alike.\n\nEstablished by the business titan, the Mike Adenuga Foundation stands as a beacon of pan-African philanthropy.\n\nRooted in the belief of fostering social and economic empowerment across Nigeria and other African nations, where the Mike Adenuga group of companies operates, the foundation is committed to catalysing positive transformations in these regions.\n\nThrough a diverse array of initiatives, it endeavours to harness resources, cultivate skills and knowledge, ignite innovation, drive social and economic progress, fortify infrastructure, widen educational access, improve healthcare systems, foster partnerships between nonprofits and governmental bodies, promote commerce, empower local enterprises, and elevate living standards.\n\nAt its core, the foundation prioritises critical areas such as health, rural development, education, entrepreneurship, and providing special opportunity grants.\n\nDistinguishing itself from conventional grant-giving entities, it strategically aligns with stakeholders and beneficiaries to conceive and execute impactful programmes.\n\nThe foundation donated N500m to aid flood victims in Bayelsa State.\n\nThrough its actions and collaborations, the Mike Adenuga Foundation assumes a pivotal role in advancing philanthropy and effecting positive change across African societies.\n\nMore than just offering aid, its mission is to empower Nigerians and other Africans by creating enduring solutions that propel social and economic progress.\n\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Adenuga demonstrated remarkable leadership by being among the first to donate N1.5bn towards combating the dreaded coronavirus scourge.\n\nIn addition to offering crucial assistance in handling the situation, his proactive initiative encouraged other Nigerians to support the cause. This exemplifies Adenuga's characteristic leadership style: he leads by example, prompting others to follow suit.\n\nIn Adenuga's words, \"How much money can one individual or his family enjoy? You must spread it and touch lives; that is what brings true happiness and joy. What's the point if your friend is wealthy and it doesn't show in his friends?\"", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justice_okamgba@punchng.com", "name": "Justice Okamgba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/30062159/Adenuga-e1682832118303.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9514593", "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 452043288, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b33"}

Hundreds of students are being arrested in universities across the United States. In Spain, hundreds of thousands have protested since the beginning of the war, while in Sanaa, Yemen, over a million people gathered last week to protest the US-backed genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe pseudo-left Revolutionary Left (IR) group, the former Spanish affiliate of both the International Marxist Tendency (IMT) and the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI), is suddenly trying to distance itself from PSOE-Sumar government, and its main ally in parliament, Podemos. All these parties are accomplices in the Israeli genocide against the Palestinians.\n\nUnder first the PSOE-Podemos government (2020-2023), and now the PSOE-Sumar government, IR backed these parties of capitalist government and worked to block working class opposition on their left. Both governments increased trade, military, and economic relations with the Zionist regime, particularly in arms. Under PSOE-Podemos, Spain sold weapons to Israel worth hundreds of millions of euros while Madrid spent millions buying weapons with the \"combat-tested\" mark. The PSOE-Sumar government kept buying and selling millions of euros worth of weaponry from Israel.\n\nIR is now attempting to distance itself from these parties, to hide its support for parties complicit in the genocide. In \"PSOE-Sumar, the NATO Government and the militarism,\" IR states:\n\n[W]e cannot place any trust in a government that has demonstrated ad nauseam that it operates for the interests of the capitalists and follows the directives of imperialist masters in Washington. Likewise, other political forces, such as [Podemos], which no longer bear governmental responsibilities but center their entire strategy on institutional action, do not present a viable alternative. Many of the aggressive measures mentioned were endorsed while Podemos held ministerial positions, and their current critique, devoid of any assumption of responsibility, only exacerbates their credibility crisis.\n\nMilitarism is an organic feature of social democracy. Historically, they have consistently acquiesced to the ruling class, and this tendency persists in their current bellicose stance in Ukraine, their NATO alignment, and their complicity with the Zionist genocide. This leftist faction does not constitute part of the solution but rather contributes to the problem.\n\nIR is running from Podemos like rats fleeing from a sinking ship. IR knows Podemos and Sumar's support is plummeting to all-time lows. In the regional elections held this year in Galicia and the Basque Country, Podemos failed to win any seats. Eight years before, Podemos was the most voted party in the Basque Country. The polls are equally dire for the upcoming European elections, where Podemos is expected to receive 2.3 percent of the vote, down from 10 percent in 2019.\n\nSumar, a split-off from Podemos ruling with the PSOE at national level, is also collapsing. It did not obtain any lawmakers in Galicia and only one seat in the Basque Country. It is polling at 2.9 percent in European elections.\n\nThe crisis of the main \"Left Populist\" parties of bourgeois rule in Spain is exposing IR's own bankruptcy. Over the past decade, IR has been one of the greatest cheerleaders of Podemos and its participation in a PSOE-led government. In 2019, when Podemos entered into government, IR wrote that this \"represents an event of historical significance which has raised enormous expectations.\" Such a government,\" they said, was \"the result of the great mass mobilization that has shaken the Spanish State.\"\n\nDespite Podemos' flagrantly right-wing policies -- raising the military budget, slashing pensions and wages, providing billions of euros in corporate bailouts and pursuing a profits-over-lives policy in the COVID-19 pandemic that cost over 140,000 lives -- IR kept working as a de facto faction of Podemos.\n\nIR threw all its strength into supporting the leader and founder of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, in the Madrid regional elections in 2021. It called for a Podemos vote with posters larger than those of the pseudo-left party itself. They boasted of hanging 11,000 posters and distributing more than 121,000 pamphlets backing Iglesias.\n\nOver the next years, the PSOE-Podemos government escalated its war at home and abroad. It provided hundreds of millions in weaponry to the far-right Ukrainian regime in the NATO war against Russia, massacred refugees on Spain's borders, imposed minimum service requirements on air crews, and attacked striking truck drivers and metal workers. All the while, it intensified its support for the far-right Netanyahu government, despite it brutal occupation of Gaza that led to the October 7 uprising against Israel.\n\nNonetheless, IR once again called the \"left\" to rally behind the PSOE-Sumar government after last year's elections. In November 2023, the PSOE and Sumar formed a new coalition government, without Podemos. Soon after, IR posted an article titled \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez supports his investiture: a Government for social peace and collaboration with imperialism.\" While admitting the reactionary character of the PSOE-Sumar government, IR continued:\n\n\"Despite everything, the constitution of a PSOE-Sumar Government appears in the eyes of a large majority of our class as a million times preferable to a PP-Vox Government. From Revolutionary Left we perfectly understand this opinion. Of course, it would be profoundly wrong for the left-wing forces with parliamentary representation to deny their critical support for S\u00e1nchez's investiture!\"\n\nSoon after, IR welcomed Podemos' exit from government as many of its voters joined pro-Palestinian protests. The largest and most sustained anti-war movement since the Vietnam War era was erupting around the world, with millions participating in protests. IR stated \"From Revolutionary Left we welcome this decision, and we say that it has to be the beginning of a real break with the social democratic policies of that left that has become an essential prop of capitalist rule...\"\n\nPodemos left government not because it opposed the genocide in Gaza, austerity or militarism, all of which it supported from 2020 to 2023. To make clear its continuing support for the PSOE and Sumar, Podemos leader Ione Belarra declared that \"the democratic forces [Podemos, PSOE and Sumar] must work together\" against the far-right.\n\nIR now is following the exact same path. It is distancing itself from Podemos, the same way Podemos took distance from the PSOE-Sumar government. However, it aims not to mobilize working class opposition to the PSOE-Sumar government, but to guard the left flank of the pseudo-left parties tasked with defending the strategic interests of Spanish imperialism.\n\nIR is promoting regionalist and nationalist forces that defend the PSOE-Sumar government in parliament. For the Galician elections, it called for a vote to the Nationalist Galician Bloc (BNG), stating: \"It would be very important to strengthen street action and demand from day one that a BNG-PSOE Government fulfills its promises.\" In the Basque country it called to vote for the Basque-nationalist EH Bildu party, arguing, \"we are not abstentionists, and that is why we ask for a critical vote for EH Bildu.\"\n\nBoth parties have supported the PSOE-Podemos and the PSOE-Sumar governments in hiking military expenditure to record levels and turning Spain into a spearhead of NATO against Russia in Ukraine.\n\nIR justifies its support for these parties under the idea that \"Revolutionary communists, Leninists, have never championed abstentionism\" in elections. This is a shameless and miserable charade. IR has never been a Marxist organization. This organization traces its roots back to a British-based group led by Ted Grant that broke with Trotskyism and split from the Fourth International in the late 1940s.\n\nThe Grant group subsequently became among the most vociferous promoters of Pabloism, which the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was formed to fight in 1953. Adapting to the post-Second World War social order, the Pabloites wrote off the working class as an independent revolutionary force. They argued that the Stalinist bureaucracy, bourgeois nationalist movements in the colonial countries, and the union and social-democratic bureaucracies would be transformed under mass pressure into revolutionary organizations.\n\nGrant and his followers developed \"entryism\" as a permanent strategic orientation. They aimed not at politically educating workers through a struggle against the pro-capitalist bureaucracies, but to keep radicalized workers within the confines of the Labour Party and trade union bureaucracies.\n\nIn Spain, IR demanded that workers and youth should subordinate themselves to the PSOE in the 1980s, then the Stalinist-led United Left and then Podemos since 2014. Now, faced with the growing collapse of Podemos, IR is searching for new tools to prop up the discredited PSOE-Sumar government.\n\nMobilizing the working class to halt the genocide requires breaking with the nationalist outlook of pseudo-left groups that subordinate workers to the Spanish capitalist state. Only an international, independent movement of the working class can halt arms deliveries to Israel, stop repression of protests, and end the wars. The political basis of such a movement is the International Committee of the Fourth International's struggle to expose pseudo-left tendencies such as IR and build sections of the ICFI in Spain and internationally as the revolutionary leadership of the working class.\n\nRead moreSpain's Podemos politically complicit in the genocide of Palestinians15 March 2024Podemos electoral debacle in Spain exposes bankruptcy of Revolutionary Left (IR) group22 June 2023Spain's pseudo-left Revolutionary Left promotes M\u00e9lenchon in France, Podemos government at home24 May 2023Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:SpainThe Politics of the Pseudo-LeftStop Israel's genocide in Gaza!Europe", "source": {"uri": "wsws.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Socialist"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.wsws.org/asset/85fd71dc-feed-499c-a233-8b8fb336c260?rendition=1600x900", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 452043174, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b34"}

The 2026 eclipse will be visible in Greenland and Iceland rather than major Spanish cities like Madrid and Barcelona. The next total eclipse in Spain will be on 2 August 2027, with southern Spain and other regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East in the path.\n\nNorth America just experienced a once-in-a-lifetime solar eclipse, with millions of people seeing it. But that's it for the United States as it won't experience another total solar eclipse until 23 August 2044 (and even then, it will only be seen in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota).

Besides defense, it is an important trade partner of India. Additionally, with the onset of global sanction on Russia, it has become a major shield to India's oil economy.\n\nParadoxically, while global sanctions on Russia dashed the European economy, it has become boon to India. Russia became the biggest crude oil supplier to India in 2022-23 and the trigger for India's exports of petroleum refinery products. India imports over 90 percent of crude oil demand.\n\nIn 2022-23, Russia was the 5 biggest trading partner of India, compared to 25 in 2021-22. This has invoked a new era of India-Russia economic relations.\n\nThe greater part of the revival in India-Russia economic relations was due to oil supply. Russia played a key role in protecting India from oil turbulence due to global the oil sanction on Russia. India and China were non-parties to the sanctions.\n\nAs a result, there was no major hike in the prices of petrol, diesel and other refinery products. Inflation, which is the immediate shock of oil price hike, remained cooled.\n\nThe EU prohibited maritime exports of Russian oil and levied a price cap of US$60 per barrel in December 2022. This followed suit to the USA, G-7 and Australia for price capping on Russian oil. The angry Russia retaliated and banned the export of oil to these nations on February 1, 2023.\n\nIn 2022-23, nearly 22 percent of total crude oil was imported from Russia. Eventually, Russian oil became the biggest base for India's manufacturing oil refinery products and exports. India imports crude oil, refines them domestically and exports refinery products, such as petrol, diesel, ATF and others.\n\nTo ride over the sanctions, India and Russia set up alternative arrangements. Indian refineries have accepted Russian insurance. Russian oil suppliers are trying to handle Urals oil transport to India by themselves, using their own vessels and shipping arrangement. Further, the Indian government has permitted nine Indian banks to open vostro accounts with Russian banks. This facilitated to deal with Russian oil in rupee trade in a currency swapping deal. The Indian UCO bank has opened the vostro accounts with Russian Gazprombank and VTB banks.\n\nPetroleum refinery products have been the major products in the Indian export basket. Since Russia was the biggest supplier of crude oil in 2022-23, it played a key role in boosting export of petroleum refinery products. Oil refinery products, which hold biggest share in the total export basket, was the engine for India's overall exports growth.\n\nBoth in terms of share in growth and share in exports , petroleum refinery products are topping the export basket. For example, while all other major export items exhibited a normal growth in between 8 to 10 percent, petroleum refinery products spurred by 44.5 percent in 2022-23 y-o-y basis. It's share in total exports of the country increased to 22.6 percent in 2022-23 , from 15.9 percent in 2021-22.\n\nRussian crude oil, converted into refinery products and exported from India, does not violate internationally recognized Rules of Origin. It has been defined that crude, once refined in another country, is classified for the purpose of trade as originating from the refinery country.\n\nThus, notwithstanding ban on import of Russian crude oil under sanctions, Russian crude was flowing through India and China in the form of petroleum refinery products like petrol, diesel, jet fuels and others. India and China, who are not part of sanctions, were able to legally import Russian crude and refine them in oil products, according to Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CERA).\n\nThis demonstrates India's unique balancing imports of crude oil by export of petroleum refinery products. This led to lesser pressure on BOP (Balance of Payment). In 2022-23, India imported crude oil worth US$157,531 million. It exported petroleum refinery products worth $ 97,468 million, leaving a balance of US$60,063 million as the net imports.\n\nIn the preceding year 2021-22, when Russia had negligible share in crude oil imports, net imports were much bigger.

In 2024, nothing has changed.\n\nIn the award-winning Sea of Poppies, Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh immortalised the journey of 19th century indentured labour migrants- called \"girmitiyas\"-aboard a ship to Mauritius during the heyday of British colonialism.\n\nIt's 2024. Another group of migrant workers trudges through New Delhi international airport carrying cheap plastic suitcases, wearing clothing bought off roadside flea markets.\n\nThey are the new age \"girmitiyas\" in search of a promised El Dorado.\n\nMore than 60 Indian construction workers left for Israel in early April amid mounting concerns for their safety and rising opposition from trade unions in India, but to no avail.\n\nThe low cost Azerbaijan Airways flight, which took these worker armies to the outskirts of Tel Aviv, was jam-packed. Some workers were shunted off to an Ethiopian Airways flight which took an even more circuitous route to the promised land.\n\nThese workers travelled despite their government having warned Indians that Israel is now a war zone and it's best to avoid any travel there.\n\nIn March, the Indian government advised Indians in Israel to move to safer locations following the killing of migrant worker Pat Nibin Maxwell.\n\nBut India's worker-migrants have kept marching.\n\nWhen Israel's war on Palestine erupted last October, Israel cancelled the permits of Palestinian workers, and sought to replace them with as many as 100,000 migrant workers from countries like India, continuing an agreement between the two governments.\n\nWhile Israel's recruitment of workers in a conflict zone is worrying, far worse is India's willingness to send its workers into the line of fire.\n\nMore than 18,000 Indians, mostly care workers, already work in Israel. Another 6,000 were to join them in April. Some reports indicate that the travel plans for the remaining are on hold.\n\nThe motivations of the Indian government - which actively facilitated the recruitment of Indian workers to Israel under its National Skill Development Corporation - come into question.\n\nThe answer can be found in India's strained relationship with its migrant workers - both under British colonialism and after independence.\n\nAfter the first steps were taken toward the abolition of slavery in the 19th century, Britain recruited more than 1 million workers from colonial India to work in sugar, coffee, rubber, tea and cotton plantations, in laying railway tracks and in mining, in colonies across the globe, from the Caribbean, to the Pacific as well as in India itself.\n\nThe indentured workers entered a contract for three to five years. They would be advanced a certain amount of money, and at the end entitled to free passage home.\n\nAcross the great Gangetic plains, thousands of agricultural workers in economic distress joined the sea voyages, part of the system that continued until 1917. To the government, they came to be known as \"coolies\".\n\nWhile the workers were supposed to be subjects of the British Indian government, in reality plantation lobbies and commercial interests had considerable say in the system. From the moment they signed up for indentureship, the workers were subjected to multiple authorities, including the labour recruiter, the agent, the ship's captain and eventually the plantation owner.\n\nPlantation work and other work was often risky and backbreaking. The presence of single women was considered 'immoral', leading to calls by Indian nationalists to demand an abolition of the system.\n\nSome commentators have termed indentureship a \"new system of slavery\", while others argue that indentureship was better than the life of poverty and hunger they left behind in debt-ridden United Provinces or modern day Bihar.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1918, more than 500,000 Indian signed up as non-combatants in World War One, working in the medical, ordnance and transport services, as grass cutters, blacksmiths, veterinary personnel and in various other jobs that need to be done in and around a regiment.\n\nThese included porters recruited from prisons as well as young men signing up to the Indian Porter Corps and Indian Labour Corps from United Provinces, Bihar, Assam, Bengal, Orissa, Burma and the North Western Frontier Province-much of it the same catchment area which supplied the indentured workers.\n\nMore than 17,000 Indian non-combatants were killed in the World War One. The wounded were racially segregated for treatment, which was not up to the standard of care for the British.\n\nMuch like indentured workers who were denied their rights as sovereign British-Indian subjects, or the workers shipped out during the World War One, the migrant workers in Israel will be navigating work amidst an ongoing war and a newly developing crisis with Iran, with no safety net in place.\n\nAs for the modern-day labourers, their willingness to sign up to work in a conflict zone such as Israel is testimony to their acute financial distress.\n\nA recent International Labour Organization report shows that total unemployed youth in India almost doubled from 35.2 percent in 2000 to 65.7 percent in 2022.\n\nThe COVID lockdown of 2020 and the spectacular distress of migrant workers, employed in various unorganised sectors ranging from agriculture to construction, showed the precarious nature of their employment and their flimsy incomes.\n\nConstruction workers selected for jobs in Israel were quoted in the media as saying that despite the obvious dangers of their job, the payment was too lucrative to turn down. For many, it was almost ten times what they make in a month. For others, devoid of any safety nets, their existing jobs also leave them vulnerable.\n\nTwo Indian workers recruited under false pretences but made to work with the Russian military were killed in the past two months, while reportedly 100 like them continue to work in Russia, having migrated through an agent.\n\nAlthough not in a conflict zone, various Gulf countries, including Qatar, have been criticised for large numbers of migrant worker deaths - especially in the lead up to the FIFA World Cup in 2022.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2022, 2,400 Indian nationals were reported to have died in Qatar, falling victim to harsh working conditions and unfavourable laws, including the now-scrapped Kafala system.\n\nFamilies claim the only time the Indian government steps in to help migrant workers and their families is when their bodies have to be returned home. The case of Pat Nibin Maxwell was no different.\n\nMaxwell travelled to work in Israel through a recruitment agency, unlike the ones now being recruited through direct government intervention in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Indian Embassy's first intervention in his life was in his death, as it was for Hemil Mangukiya and Mohammed Asfan in Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, as their families grieve, five other Indian states are keen on joining the recruitment process.\n\nPostcolonial India does not seem any better than its colonial avatar in caring for its migrant workers.

This speculation comes at a time when Turks suspect U.S. involvement in the coup and when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has accused the West of supporting the coup. It also coincides with exhortations by commentators for the West to rethink, reassess or cut ties with Ankara. Such accusations and rhetoric call the future of Turkish-Western relations into question.\n\nWithin the field of international relations, realists assume that conflicts and alliances between states are determined and shaped by material measures of power, including geostrategic location, geographic depth, population size, economic vigor and military technology. Liberals, on the other hand, believe that inter-state relations are influenced by value-based or normative considerations, such as the extent that governments are democratic or authoritarian, and respect and uphold international institutions, laws, norms and values.\n\nAmid recent tensions before and after the failed coup, Turkish-Western relations have become strained over the liberals' value-based concerns. However, these relations will likely remain intact for the foreseeable future due to the realists' material factors in the geopolitical, military and economic realms.\n\nSince the failed coup attempt, Turkey and the West have squabbled over normative issues. The Turkish government has demanded that the United States extradite the Turkish cleric, Fethullah G\u00fclen, who has been living on his Pennsylvania estate in self-imposed exile since 1999. While secular officers may have led the coup, Ankara insists that G\u00fclen stand trial for allegedly staging and orchestrating a coup that threatened to illegally and unconstitutionally overthrow a democratically elected government. In the process, the Turkish government has been unable to understand why the democratic West would deny such a request.\n\nBefore agreeing to extradite G\u00fclen, the United States has demanded that Ankara comply with the principles of due process and the rule of law by submitting concrete evidence that corroborates his guilt or complicity in the coup. In the meantime, the United States and EU have condemned the post-coup purges and alleged torture that have taken place against thousands of suspected G\u00fclen sympathizers and followers in the government, bureaucracy, military, police, judiciary, media and academia -- the so-called parallel state. The EU has also censured the temporary suspension of the European Convention on Human Rights by the Turkish government so it could declare a three-month state of emergency and potentially impose the death penalty against suspected coup plotters and participants.\n\nPrior to the coup, Turkish-Western tensions had already surfaced and intensified over Ankara's authoritarian tendencies, including its repression of the Gezi Park protests and Erdo\u011fan's implicit designs to amend the constitution, change the political system to a presidential one, and concentrate executive powers into his hands. These designs are predicated on the AKP's ability to secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority in future elections. Western nations and international organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have intensely scrutinized and maintained high expectations and standards for Turkey -- a country that exceptionally established one of the Middle East's first pluralist, parliamentary democracies in 1950, joined NATO and the Baghdad Pact or CENTO in the 1950s and has sought EU accession since 1987.\n\nWhile value-based issues have tested and strained Turkish-Western relations, the probability of their demise is mitigated by material factors in the geopolitical, military, and economic domains. Geopolitically and militarily, the normative tensions that emerged between Turkey and the West have prompted commentators to propose expelling Turkey from NATO. This proposal had previously been raised after Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet and refrained from combatting ISIS in Syria. Following the failed coup, Ankara will have to convince NATO that it can restore military order and remain a reliable partner in multilateral operations. Nevertheless, Turkey's expulsion from NATO would damage the latter's reputation and integrity.\n\nTurkey's expulsion from NATO would also push Turkey toward one of its largest trading partners, Russia -- even if tensions between both countries over the fate and future of Syria will persist. Turkish-Russian rapprochement -- which had already been occurring before the coup -- would defeat the original purpose of NATO and the Baghdad Pact/CENTO of using Turkey as a buffer state against Soviet or Russian intervention in the Middle East. Expulsion from NATO would eliminate the benefits and privileges that Turkey receives as the Middle East's only member nation including hardware, equipment, technology, training, expertise, professionalization, coordination, intelligence, security and prestige.\n\nHistorical considerations aside, Turkey and the West currently and mutually benefit from their NATO alliance. To alleviate socioeconomic pressures and security concerns, the EU has increasingly counted on Turkey and signed a controversial and tenuous agreement with it to stem the flow of millions of Syrian refugees, especially with mounting terrorist attacks on European soil. The United States and the EU depend on access to Turkish airspace to conduct airstrikes and other operations against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. After the coup, Turkey temporarily closed the Incirlik military base and suspended operations there to likely get its military house in order, but also to send a message to the West regarding the repercussions of supporting the coup, condemning the government's response or refusing to meet its demands.\n\nDespite Turkey's dubious relationship with ISIS as a counterweight against the Kurds, Ankara recognizes the importance of maintaining and intensifying the fight against it after recent suicide attacks on the Istanbul airport and other local targets. After failing to become a model of Islamist democracy in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring and antagonizing regional allies with interventionist policies, Turkey cannot afford further isolation by distancing itself from its traditional allies in NATO. Ankara's real and perceived vulnerability after the coup renders cooperation and rapprochement with these allies an imperative.\n\nEconomically, the stakes of straining and rupturing Turkish-Western relations are equally high. Alongside Iraq, Iran, the UAE, Russia, China and South Korea, the EU and United States represent Turkey's top trading partners. Since entering into a customs union with Ankara in 1995, the EU has become Turkey's largest import-export market for machinery and transport equipment, manufactured goods and chemical products. The relationship is bidirectional in that Turkey respectively comprises the seventh and fifth largest market for European imports and exports in similar sectors with steady flows of FDI on both sides. Even if Turkey's suspension of the European Convention on Human Rights sets back the EU accession process -- which had already been called into question given its lengthy duration and the affirmative vote on Brexit -- economic integration has already materialized and become a reality.\n\nWhile less prominent than the EU, the United States still represents an important trading partner. Bilateral trade between the United States and Turkey has increased significantly since Erdo\u011fan first came to power in 2003. Between 2010 and 2013, U.S. exports to Turkey more than doubled and included oil, iron, steel, aircraft, machinery, yarn, fabric and agriculture. In 2013, the United States began FTA negotiations with Turkey, and in 2015, accounted for $6.4 billion or 4.5 percents of its total exports, including vehicles, machinery, iron, steel, stone, plaster, cement and agriculture. Behind Germany, the United States constituted the largest market for Turkish exports in 2016.\n\nAs with the EU and Turkey, the United States and Turkey benefit from bidirectional FDI, even if the U.S. sum is approximately ten times greater. Without possessing the oil and natural gas reserves of its neighbors, Turkey relies on outside investment to bolster manufacturing and services. To maintain or boost its credit rating after recent terrorist attacks and the failed coup, Ankara will have to delicately balance the competing priorities of reestablishing stability and security with preserving transparency and the rule of law.\n\nTo protect or safeguard its legitimacy and longevity, the Turkish government will likely continue to demand G\u00fclen's extradition and subject suspected traitors and opponents to draconian measures -- which ultimately may further destabilize Turkey and the wider region. Particularly in an election year, the United States and its European allies will condemn these measures and contemplate punitive responses. Yet, given the United States and EU's authoritarian allies and unsavory bedfellows in the Middle East, such condemnations and threats will carry little credibility. In the end, contentious statements surrounding value-based issues will cause the Turkish-Western relationship to bend. Yet, material factors related to geopolitics, militaries and economics -- combined with the institutional momentum and inertia of historical alliances -- will prevent it from breaking.\n\nIf Egypt is any indicator, the West's relationship with Turkey will persevere. After Egypt's successful military coup in 2013 and the widespread repression that has followed, the United States and EU momentarily withheld or considered withholding military aid and financial assistance, but returned to business as usual given Camp David's enduring legacy and Cairo's geostrategic value. During this period of dramatic turmoil in the Middle East with a preponderance of failing states and formidable nonstate actors, the West will likely continue to favor stability over democracy -- even if a deficit in the latter polarizes, antagonizes and radicalizes the region's citizens.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/turkey_4.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452044560, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b3d"}

But, really, it came down to only two men: Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nWashington's annual mashup of political humor and earnest paeans to the free press is typically a good-natured collection of one-liners and affectionate jabs at friends and enemies alike. But it was the leading 2024 presidential contenders who loomed largest - one in the Washington Hilton hotel ballroom, the other who definitely, positively, probably was not watching from Mar-a-Lago. Unless, of course, he was.\n\n\"The 2024 election is in full swing and, yes, age is an issue,\" President Biden told the black-tie crowd. \"I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.\"\n\n\"Can we just acknowledge how refreshing it is,\" comedian Colin Jost later added, \"to see a president of the United States at an event that doesn't begin with a bailiff saying, 'All rise!'\"\n\nFor most of the evening, Trump ignored the dinner and posted instead about presidential immunity and political witch hunts. Shortly after 1 a.m., he finally chimed in on Truth Social: \"The White House Correspondents' Dinner was really bad. Colin Jost BOMBED, and Crooked Joe was an absolute disaster! Doesn't get much worse than this!\"\n\nSo, basically, another day on the campaign trail.\n\nBut for the denizens of Washington's political media, it was a special occasion. The correspondents' dinner is ostensibly a playful celebration of the codependent relationship between Washington politicians and reporters who spend the rest of the year covering them and deadly serious issues: Trump's legal trials, looming uncertainty about what will happen in November (and beyond), the Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIt proved hard to put all that aside for the night. Especially Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protesters surrounded the entrance outside of the hotel, shouting chants such as, \"Western media, you can't hide! We charge you with genocide!\" and confronting guests arriving to the dinner in their tuxedos and gowns. Some attendees were followed by tight circles of protesters yelling \"Shame!\" inches from their faces until they could get behind police.\n\n\"I came in through a different entrance, so I didn't hear exactly what they are chanting,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), running up an escalator to the lobby. \"But there are tens of thousands of people being blown to bits in Gaza, so I understand why they are protesting. I stand with the movement - depending on what they are saying.\"\n\nThe experience of walking the gantlet of activists seemed to have left a lot of people somewhat stunned. But inside the ballroom, it was all smiles and hugs and back slaps.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) charmed everyone, wearing a big smile and a \"FREE EVAN\" pin in honor of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) gave a report on his own encounter with the protesters outside: \"I asked them about what was happening in Sudan. And they yelled louder. And then I asked them about the concentration camps full of Uyghurs. And they yelled louder. And then I went inside.\" Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for New York Magazine, got off a presidential zinger of her own: \"I can't hear a thing in here - I feel like Biden.\"\n\nBiden's own zingers were directed almost entirely at his opponent.\n\n\"Trump's so desperate, he started reading those Bibles he's selling,\" the president said. \"Then he got to the First Commandment: 'You shall have no other gods before me.' That's when he put it down and said, 'This book's not for me.'\"\n\nBut the president soon dispensed with the yuks and pivoted to what felt like a stump speech about the clear and present danger posed by Trump and his movement. He called on the journalists in the room to report \"truth over lies.\" He implored them to move past the election horse race stories and focus on American democracy. \"The stakes couldn't be higher,\" he said. No punchline.\n\nOfficially, the evening is nonpartisan, and the only toast of the night goes to the sitting president, regardless of party affiliation. Unofficially, the dinner has always been perceived as a hotbed of Washington elites who lean left, regardless of media affiliation.\n\nTrump, who was famously roasted by President Barack Obama at the 2011 dinner, never attended the event as president. His relentless criticism of the mainstream media caused many news organizations to threaten a boycott of the dinner in 2017; Trump announced that he would not attend. He skipped two following years and even counterprogrammed with a MAGA rally instead. The party soldiered on, reinforcing a commitment to the role of a free press in a democracy, and many breathed a not-so-discreet sigh of relief when the crowd resumed in 2022 after the worst of the pandemic with Biden carrying the torch.\n\nThe only Trump spotted at this year's festivities was daughter-in-law Lara Trump, recently crowned co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Her father-in-law wasn't in the building, but comic impressionist Matt Friend emerged from the crowd with a Trump impersonation - as well as sendups of Bernie Sanders, Mitch McConnell and Obama. He also made the first (and, surprisingly, only) dead-dog joke of the night.\n\n\"I am killing this dinner harder than Kristi Noem kills the puppies,\" Friend said in his Trump voice, riffing off the news that the Republican governor of South Dakota, in a forthcoming book, admits to shooting her 14-month-old dog because she was \"untrainable\" and aggressive.\n\nLet's face it: It's a tough room for a comedian. Jost, co-anchor of \"Saturday Night Live's\" \"Weekend Update,\" sat at the head table next to the president and nearby first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and WHCA President Kelly O'Donnell, senior White House correspondent for NBC News. His speech came after Biden's and felt like one of his SNL bits: Some jokes got laughs, others landed awkwardly.\n\nThere were a few jabs at Biden, a \"decent\" man who Jost said reminds him of his beloved grandfather, a Staten Island firefighter. There were also some uneven one-liners about the press, but the press never laughs at itself, so it's hard to know whether they were good or bad jokes.\n\nJost took several swipes at the former president, too: \"I love that Trump's two attacks on Biden are that he's a senile old man and a criminal mastermind. I think you've got to pick one. Personally, I don't know any criminal masterminds who bike to get ice cream.\" On the courtroom drawings that have emerged from the trials: \"Every sketch of Trump looks like the Grinch had sex with the Lorax.\"\n\nJost brought the evening's most glamorous celebrity: movie star Scarlett Johansson, whom he married in 2020. What started a century ago as an annual gathering of reporters and their subjects morphed into the \"Nerd Prom\" about 35 years ago - a red carpet extravaganza where news organizations battle to host administration officials, Hollywood A-listers, corporate heavyweights and anyone else basking in their 15 minutes of fame. Within the throngs are a few people who actually work as White House correspondents.\n\nWith some exceptions, this year's guest list fell solidly into B-list territory: Jon Hamm, Chris Pine, Keri Russell, Molly Ringwald, Rosario Dawson, Jon Cryer, Caitlyn Jenner, Billy Porter, Lorne Michaels.\n\nBefore the speeches, the WHCA handed out its awards for excellence. The award for overall excellence went to Barak Ravid of Axios, Peter Baker of the New York Times received the print award for deadline reporting, and Tamara Keith of NPR received the broadcast award in the same category - all singled out for stories following Hamas's Oct. 7 attack in Israel. Doug Mills of the Times got the award for visual journalism for a striking photo of Biden, and the award for courage and accountability went to The Washington Post for coverage on the impact of assault rifles and mass shootings.\n\nThe evening ended, as it always does: with an impassioned defense of democracy and the critical role of the press in preserving it.\n\nJost had his own thoughts about the media. \"Your words speak truth to power. Your words bring light to the darkness.\" Then he paused and grinned, \"And most importantly, your words train the AI programs that will soon replace you.\"\n\nBiden ended with a toast of his own: \"To a free press. To an informed citizenry. To an America where freedom and democracy endure. God bless America.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/28/PDTN/73494894007-correspondents-j-3-pv-7-iolqtjwhe-6-wb-6-pgwqwow-4.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3497,1968,x0,y304&format=pjpg&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-9519637", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 452044548, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b3e"}

Doctors and ambulance crews evacuated patients from a Kyiv children's hospital on Friday after a video circulated online saying Russia planned to attack it. Francisco Seco/Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's troops have been forced to make a tactical retreat from three villages in the embattled east, the country's army chief said Sunday, warning of a worsening battlefield situation as Ukrainian forces wait for much-needed arms from a huge U.S. aid package to reach combat zones.\n\nCol. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi reported that Russian forces continue to attack \"along the entire front line\" of more than 620 miles, with pitched battles raging west of Avdiivka, the eastern city they took in February after a grueling, monthslong fight.\n\n\"The most difficult situation is in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions, where fierce battles continue,\" Syrskyi's said in an update posted to the Telegram messaging app, referencing two Ukrainian-held cities in the war-torn Donetsk region, once a hub of industry.\n\n\"The enemy has engaged up to four brigades in these directions, is trying to develop an offensive west of Avdiivka and Marinka, making its way to Pokrovsk and Kurakhove,\" Syrskyi added. \"Units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, preserving the lives and health of our defenders, moved to new frontiers west of Berdychi, Semenivka and Novomykhailivka.\"\n\nTwo of these front-line villages lie less than 31 miles east of Pokrovsk, while the third is located just over 19 miles by road from Kurakhove.\n\nA Washington-based think tank predicted late Saturday that Russian forces \"will likely make significant tactical gains in thec coming weeks,\" as acute ammunition shortages continue to hobble Ukraine's defense efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its latest operational assessment, the Institute for the Study of War said that Moscow's forces have opportunities to push forward around Avdiivka, and also threaten nearby Chasiv Yar. Its capture would give Russia control of a hilltop from which it can attack other key cities forming the backbone of Ukraine's eastern defenses.\n\nDespite this, the think tank assessed that neither of these efforts by Moscow are likely to cause Kyiv's defensive lines to collapse \"in the near term.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday confirmed that Moscow's troops had taken a village about 9 miles north of Avdiivka, days after the war institute reported on its likely capture early on Thursday. That day's assessment described Moscow's gains as \"relatively quick but still relatively marginal,\" adding that Russian troops had advanced by no more than 5 kilometers (3 miles) over the previous week.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden promised on Wednesday that U.S. weapons shipments would begin making their way into Ukraine within hours, as he signed into law a $95 billion measure -- $61 billion of which was allocated for Ukraine -- that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hot spots. The announcement marked an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, Russian drones struck the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Mykolaiv early Sunday, setting a hotel ablaze and damaging infrastructure, according to local officials.\n\nVitaliy Kim, the governor of Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv province, said that the drones \"seriously damaged\" a hotel in its namesake capital, sparking a fire that was later extinguished. Kim also reported that the strike damaged heat-generating infrastructure in the city. He added that there were no casualties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian state agency RIA reported that the strike on Mykolaiv targeted a shipyard where naval drones are assembled, as well as a hotel housing \"English-speaking mercenaries\" who have fought for Kyiv. The RIA report cited Sergei Lebedev, described as a coordinator of local pro-Moscow guerrillas. His comments couldn't be independently verified.\n\nAlso on Sunday morning, the Russian Defense Ministry said that 17 Ukrainian drones were downed overnight over four regions in the country's southwest. Three drones were intercepted near an oil depot in Lyudinovo, an industrial town about 230 kilometers (143 miles) north of the Ukrainian border, Gov. Vladislav Shapsha said.\n\nOne of the Ukrainian drones damaged communications infrastructure in Russia's southern Belgorod province, which borders Ukraine, Gov. Vyachaslav Gladkov said later on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry claimed Sunday that its forces had destroyed ammunition depots and military equipment housed at three airports across Ukraine, including assault drones stored at Kamyanka Airfield in the country's east. The ministry's online update said the attacks took place over the last 24 hours. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.\n\nRussian shelling on Saturday and overnight wounded at least seven civilians across Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. A 36-year-old woman was pulled alive from the rubble after Russian shells on Sunday morning destroyed her home in the northeastern Kharkiv region, the local administration reported. Her 52-year-old neighbor was also rushed to a hospital with a stomach wound, the administration said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nHow an inclusive gym brand became a battlefield over LGBTQ rights filed under: russia, ukraine Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/04/Russia_Ukraine_War_99327_94345a-1714348235.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9519715", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 452044467, "relevance": 4, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b3f"}

Others have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said.\n\nAn appliance maker in southern China is finding it hard to ship its products to Russia, not because of any problems with the gadgets but because China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over U.S. sanctions. To settle payments for its electrical goods, the Guangdong-based company is considering using currency brokers active along China's border with Russia, said the company's founder, Wang, who asked to be identified only by his family name.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia and Russian entities since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. Now the threat of extending these to banks in China - a country Washington blames for \"powering\" Moscow's war effort - is chilling the finance that lubricates even non-military trade from China to Russia.\n\nThis is posing a growing problem for small Chinese exporters, said seven trading and banking sources familiar with the situation. As China's big banks pull back from financing Russia-related transactions, some Chinese companies are turning to small banks on the border and underground financing channels such as money brokers - even banned cryptocurrency - the sources told Reuters.\n\nOthers have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said. \"You simply cannot do business properly using the official channels,\" Wang said, as big banks now take months rather than days to clear payments from Russia, forcing him to tap unorthodox payment channels or shrink his business.\n\nGOING 'UNDERGROUND' A manager at a large state-owned bank he previously used told Wang the lender was worried about possible U.S. sanctions in dealing with Russian transactions, Wang said.\n\nA banker at one of China's Big Four state banks said it had tightened scrutiny of Russia-related businesses to avert sanctions risk. \"The main reason is to avoid unnecessary troubles,\" said the banker, who asked not to be named. Since last month, Chinese banks have intensified their scrutiny of Russia-related transactions or halted business altogether to avoid being targeted by U.S. sanctions, the sources said.\n\n\"Transactions between China and Russia will increasingly go through underground channels,\" said the head of a trade body in a southeastern province that represents Chinese businesses with Russian interests. \"But these methods carry significant risks.\" Making payments in crypto, banned in China since 2021, might be the only option, said a Moscow-based Russian banker, as \"it's impossible to pass through KYC (know-your-customer) at Chinese banks, big or small\".\n\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the topic. Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes. China's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to \"the relevant authorities\".\n\nThe People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. SANCTIONS WARNING\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed \"serious concern\" that Beijing was \"powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine\". Still, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping, was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.\n\nWhile officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the U.S. preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a U.S. official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, \"China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, \"Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security. \"Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBlinken made clear to Chinese officials \"that ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest,\" the spokesperson said. \"If China does not address this problem, the United States will.\" Nearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.\n\nSome of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion. Among the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.\n\nBy contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown. 'CHANNEL CAN BE SHUT'\n\nThe four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies. Some rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.\n\nA chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name. Calls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.\n\nBOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said. The manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.\n\n\"We gave up on the Russian market,\" the manager said. \"We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.\" Wang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.\n\n\"I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,\" he said. \"What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future. The channel can be shut completely one day.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_04_32_3060217.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-9521083", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452044212, "relevance": 17, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b43"}

Nowhere is this more evident than in Zimbabwe, where President Mnangagwa's Second Republic has risen to the challenge of combating the El Nino-induced drought with compassion, determination and inclusivity.\n\nAs the country grapples with the devastating effects of the drought caused by the global climate crisis, President Mnangagwa's administration has embarked on a bold and unprecedented initiative to distribute 81 000 tonnes of grain to vulnerable families across the nation.\n\nThis monumental effort reflects not only the Government's commitment to addressing food insecurity, but also its unwavering dedication to leaving no one behind, irrespective of political affiliation or geographic location.\n\nThe El Nino-induced drought has wreaked havoc on Zimbabwe's agricultural sector, decimating crops, depleting water sources and leaving millions of people on the brink of starvation.\n\nIn the face of such dire circumstances, President Mnangagwa's administration has acted swiftly and decisively to alleviate the suffering of those most affected by the crisis.\n\nBy mobilising resources, coordinating relief efforts and prioritising the needs of vulnerable communities, the Government has demonstrated its readiness to confront even the most daunting challenges head-on.\n\nCentral to the success of the Government's response has been its unwavering commitment to inclusivity and equity. Against all odds, President Mnangagwa's Second Republic has adopted a principled approach that places the welfare of all Zimbabweans above partisan interests.\n\nIn distributing 81 000 tonnes of grain, the Government has ensured that assistance reaches those who need it most, regardless of their political affiliation or geographic location. This ethos of inclusivity reflects a profound shift in Zimbabwean politics, one that prioritises the common good over narrow self-interest and fosters a sense of national unity and solidarity.\n\nMoreover, President Mnangagwa's administration has recognised the importance of engaging with local communities and leveraging their expertise and resilience in responding to the drought crisis.\n\nBy working closely with traditional leaders, community organisations and civil society groups, the Government has been able to identify and address the unique needs of different regions and communities, ensuring that relief efforts are targeted, effective and sustainable.\n\nThis collaborative approach not only enhances the impact of Government interventions, but also empowers communities to take ownership of their own development and resilience-building efforts.\n\nIn addition to its immediate relief efforts, the Government has already been prioritising long-term solutions to address the root causes of food insecurity and vulnerability to drought.\n\nThrough initiatives such as the Command Agriculture and the famous Pfumvudza/Intwasa programmes, which promote climate-smart agricultural practices and sustainable land management techniques, President Mnangagwa's administration is laying the groundwork for a more resilient and food-secure future.\n\nBy investing in irrigation infrastructure, promoting drought-resistant crops and providing training and support to smallholder farmers, the Government is empowering communities to adapt to the changing climate and build a more sustainable agricultural sector.\n\nFurthermore, President Mnangagwa's administration has recognised the importance of international cooperation and partnership, for example, with Russia donating 25 000 tonnes of grain in response to combat the effects of the El Nino-induced drought crisis.\n\nTherefore, through partnerships with international organisations, donor agencies and neighbouring countries, Zimbabwe has been able to access additional resources and expertise to augment its own efforts. This spirit of collaboration underscores the interconnected nature of global challenges such as climate change and food insecurity and highlights the importance of collective action in addressing them.\n\nAs Zimbabwe recently celebrated its 44th year of independence on April 18, the Government's response to the El Nino-induced drought crisis serves as a powerful testament to the resilience, resourcefulness and compassion of the Zimbabwean people.\n\nIn the face of adversity, President Mnangagwa's administration has demonstrated true leadership by mobilising resources, fostering collaboration and prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable.\n\nAs the country looks to the future, it does so with renewed hope and determination, confident in its ability to overcome the challenges that lie ahead and build a brighter, more prosperous future for all Zimbabweans, leaving no one and no place behind.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/President-Mnangagwa-3.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 452043896, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b45"}

Public opinion in the framing of this term is usually based on the idea of writer, academics, media and intellectuals from the West who belong to a small group of people with power, authority and at times, wealth.\n\nOn many occasions when the phrase international community is used, there is a particular group that wants to get a certain position agreed on, a consensus or accord, on a 'global' issue to give it relevance and show how 'serious' the matter is.\n\nWithout being stated explicitly, the \"international community\" appears to be made up of North America (the United States and Canada), (Western) Europe, a few other nations that are unavoidable due to their strength or membership in the UN Security Council.\n\nAlso, countries with the appropriate historical, cultural, or, more specifically, racial background like Australia, Israel and New Zealand are also famed as members of this community. Despite representations as the \"international community\", when these countries deliberate, it has not always reflected that their agenda is legitimate. Or that the views of their countries' leaders do mirror the aspirations of their people, in a democratic fashion.\n\nThus, the \"international community\" worked heavily against Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2020, to give a tag to the African country as being an isolated, pariah, rogue or failed state by instigating illegal regime change activities.\n\nThe \"other community\", however, dismissed the consensus and public opinion that the so-called international community sought to establish against Zimbabwe.\n\nBased on their international alliance, this community stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" against Zimbabwe by creating narratives that promoted instability within Zimbabwe's borders. During this time, it was China, Cuba, Iran, Russia and South Africa, among others, which stood firm with Zimbabwe.\n\nThis process has been implemented by the \"international community\" against China and Russia, but have failed because the two countries, plus the US, are the only three great powers the world has, hence difficult to sideline.\n\nLikewise, there are strategic reasons why the \"international community\" is now keen on getting a consensus against Iran. These are the nations linked by a particular form of Eurocentrism, if not outright racism, that can also be interpreted as ethno-tribalism.\n\nWestern media, which carries traditional hostility Iran, has in the past few weeks trying to enrage the world against Iran as a policy of \"Persian hatred\" that was started by former US president Donald Trump.\n\nThe hatred has been thick such that the USA has always wanted an opportunity to \"obliterate Iran\". This ought to be seen in the context that the US-led \"international community\" which has repeatedly used the threat of nuclear weapons against Iran.\n\nAt last year's 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a dark warning to Tehran, threatening the country with a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Above all, Iran must face a credible nuclear threat,\" said Netanyahu.\n\nThis nuclear threat that the Israeli authorities later retracted saying Netanyahu had misspoken, is now viewed as war policy along the grain of this long anti-Iran history. Like President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly advocated for the \"obliteration of Iran\", which essentially means use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nFor instance, in May 2019, President Trump wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that \"if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran\".\n\nIn other posts, President Trump said that the United States would attack Iran with \"great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration\". These threats are genocidal in nature.\n\nBecause of these constant genocidal threats towards Iran, it becomes evident that other great powers take notice, hence China and Russia have and had no alternative but to move towards Iran as moral towers to diffuse the likely propensity by the \"international community\" bloc to use nuclear weapons. They have used nuclear weapons before. This is also important to ensure that Iran is not \"isolated\" because it is a regional power in south-west Asia to build a new alliance of strategic cooperation.\n\nIn Chinese and Russian official media outlets, Iran's support has been formalised and given out with certainty. Against Iran, China has condemned the use of the US' \"long-arm jurisdiction\".\n\nThe long-arm jurisdiction treacherously permits the United States to contend that it has the authority to bring legal action against other nations based on domestic legislation rather than international law.\n\nThis US conceit has been so since the collapse of the USSR, a set of states including Zimbabwe and Iran, have faced the brunt of US force being called rogue states, pariah states, failed states and even labelled state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nTo try and separate China and Russia from Iran, key facts that need to be kept in mind include that the US imposed economic pressure on China leading to a trade war. Secondly, the US also deliberately destroyed relations with Russia, sanctioning the country and expanding NATO eastwards and threatening Russia's security leading to a special military operation in Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, the US' waging of economic warfare against Iran through sanctions heavily impacts China and other countries that will have difficulties to purchase Iran's oil and to continue normal trade.\n\nSuch pressures have brought convergence to China, Iran and Russia in their resoluteness to defend the rest of the world against a racially skewed \"international community\" that only favours the US-led narratives that are detrimental to the interests of others.\n\nThis triad attraction and convergence is cementing as a reaction to the pressure from the West. US behaviour has initiated the speed at which this convergence has been made to enable increased future ties.\n\nIt should be therefore known that the \"international community\" is nothing but a bloc driven by westomania. This is among other reasons why the China-Iran-Russia triad is converging because if any of the three countries falter, the \"other community\" will also falter.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Israels-Prime-Minister-Bi-007.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520856", "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 452043883, "relevance": 8, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b46"}

In a report published on Friday, April 26, the German NGO European Platform for Democratic Elections (EPDE) revealed the identity of 183 foreign \"international observers and experts\" who were invited by the Russian authorities to observe the March 2024 presidential election, in which Putin was elected to a fifth term. It has been described by the European Parliament as \"illegitimate and undemocratic\" and was preceded by the death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny in a Russian prison on February 16.\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin's regime has been inviting European elected officials and media personalities to Russia in order to legitimize violations of international law (territorial annexations) and the corruption of democratic rules (rigged elections) to the Russian public and the international community alike. The foreign figures who are invited are displayed in the Russian media as a \"democratic\" endorsement of the Kremlin's actions. At the 2018 presidential elections, French observers included former ambassador to Moscow Jean Cadet, Rassemblement National (far right) MP Gilbert Collard, Union des D\u00e9mocrates Ind\u00e9pendants (center right) senator Jo\u00ebl Gu\u00e9rriau, and Thierry Mariani, who was then a member of Les R\u00e9publicains (right).\n\nAt the same time, Russian authorities have gradually reduced their tolerance of independent, qualified observers, including those from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), of which Russia is a member. During the last presidential election, the high level of fraud (media censorship, the exclusion and repression of any genuine opposition, the careful selection of 'rival candidates,' security checks of voters right up to the polling stations, ballot box stuffing and falsification of results) led the Kremlin to organize a sham observation, while all independent observation was banned.\n\nStaging\n\nThis staging, under the aegis of Russia's Central Election Commission (CEC), entailed the invitation of 1,115 \"international observers and experts\" from 129 countries. \"We know of cases where observers were contacted by fake NGOs, by the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, and by the Federation Council,\" reported EPDE board president Stefanie Schiffer.

and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) signalling that it will not cut interest rates soon, the Malaysian economy is unfazed and appears to be on track to grow between 4% and 5% this year in line with official estimates.\n\nMost economists expect the gross domestic product (GDP) growth projection by Bank Negara to be in sync with their forecasts, but said they were awaiting for the introduction of the planned fuel subsidy rationlisation to gauge how it would affect consumption.\n\nFurthermore, the timing of the Fed funds rate cuts could also have some impact on the domestic economy, they noted.\n\nThe recent advance estimate showed that the domestic economy grew by 3.9% in the first quarter of 2024 (1Q24) from 3% in 4Q23, backed by steady domestic demand and a rebound in external demand.\n\nMARC Ratings Bhd chief economist Ray Choy told StarBiz it is still possible for the economy to grow between 4% and 5% this year, adding that he is maintaining his forecast for 2024 at 4.2%.\n\nMARC Ratings Bhd chief economist Ray Choy\n\nHe said the advance estimate of 1Q24 GDP growth stood at 3.9%, accompanied by a turnaround in export growth which reached 2.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) for the quarter, which is a vast improvement from a minus 6.9% in 4Q23, signalling an improving external environment.\n\n\"This improvement is further supported by the global semiconductor upcycle, showing an increase of 14.9% y-o-y in revenues for the first two months of the year.\n\nAdditionally, the resilient growth of Malaysia's trade partners such as the United States and signs of a recovering China provides support to external demand.\n\n\"Other regional peers with an improving growth trajectory include India and Japan,\" he said.\n\nChoy felt the escalation in geopolitical risks in the Middle East at the moment is also limited, as the recent actions by Iran and Israel suggest an avoidance of a wider conflict.\n\nRAM Rating Services Bhd senior economist Woon Khai Jhek reckons Malaysia's GDP growth is still poised to rise higher for this year.\n\nHe said notwithstanding the underwhelming economic growth performance of 3.7% in 2023, the rating agency believes there is an upside lift for the economy and has maintained its GDP growth forecast for 2024 at 4.5% to 5.5%, slightly higher than Bank Negara's estimates of 4% to 5%.\n\nAlthough there are still some lingering and prevailing headwinds this year, he sees budding signs of recovery.\n\nThe recently released advance estimates by the Statistics Department for Malaysia's GDP indicated that economic growth accelerated to 3.9% in 1Q24 from 3% in 4Q23, underlined by steady domestic demand and a rebound in external demand, he noted.\n\nThe services sector is estimated to have expanded by 4.4% in 1Q24, inching up from 4.2% in 4Q23, primarily supported by the wholesale and retail trade sub-sector.\n\nFurthermore, he said the manufacturing sector which took a beating last year amid a slowdown in global demand and tech downcycle is also showing signs of recovery.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is estimated to have rebounded to 1.9% in 1Q24 after contracting by 0.1% and 0.3% respectively in 3Q23 and 4Q23.\n\n\"We expect that exports and the manufacturing sector will continue to boost the country's GDP growth throughout the rest of this year, as global trade continues to improve.\n\n\"The chance of a 'soft landing' appears to be higher for the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) upping its 2024 global growth forecast for the second consecutive quarter to 3.2% (plus 0.1 percentage-points from the previous forecast) this month.\n\n\"Coupled with the predicted upcycle in trade and semiconductors, we may be seeing early signs of a turnaround in global trade,\" Woon said.\n\nIn the World Trade Organisation's latest Global Trade Outlook and Statistics report released earlier this month, the international body forecasts global merchandise trade growth to recover to 2.6% this year after contracting 1.2% last year.\n\nOn the other hand, he anticipates domestic demand would continue to be a significant driver of the nation's GDP growth in 2024.\n\nThis would be supported by a robust job market and supportive financial conditions, he said.\n\nFurthermore, Woon said private consumption growth last year was weighed down by high base effects from 2022, elevated price pressures and the lapse of large policy support (e.g. Covid-19 related financial assistance and Employees Provident Fund (EPF) withdrawal schemes).\n\nAs these pressures dissipate, he said private consumption growth should also trend higher this year. To some extent, further recovery in the tourism sector may also contribute to some upside to domestic consumption and services activities, he noted.\n\nExpressing his optimism on the local economy, Bank Muamalat (M) Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid, who is forecasting a GDP growth of 4.3% this year, said Bank Negara's growth target of 4% to 5% in 2024 is within reach.He said the stable environment in the labour market, cash transfers programme, the implementation of infrastructure projects along with the turnaround in external demand are the key drivers for this year's economic growth. He said the latest move by the EPF to allow for flexible withdrawal from Account 3 could also be an important catalyst for growth as the tendencies to spend among Malaysians are quite high.\n\nOCBC Bank senior Asean economist Lavanya Venkateswaran said she is still holding on to the 4.2% y-o-y GDP forecast, noting that this based on the view the global electronics export down cycle would bottom by the first held of this year, government infrastructure focussed spending would continue, and the private consumption would stabilise.\n\n\"If the increase in global oil prices extends to other commodities such as palm oil, rubber and liquefied natural gas, it could add to tailwinds for export growth. However, if the price increases are restricted to global oil prices, the impact is less clear cut. We see limited improvements to export growth, with subsidy spending picking up. This may motivate us to press ahead with targeted fuel subsidy rationalisation,\" she said.\n\nHowever, UCSI University Malaysia associate professor of finance Liew Chee Yoong is not too upbeat on the economy. \"I don't think the local economy will continue to grow between 4% to 5% this year. There is a high risk that the conflict in the Middle East will become a larger conflict and this could occur anytime.\n\n\"If this occurs, the price of crude oil is likely to exceed US$100 per barrel resulting in drastic increase in global inflation and the risk of global stagflation. On top of that, Malaysia have to be prepared for other possible external macroeconomic shocks as well resulting from the possible invasion of China on Taiwan, the possibility of a military conflict between China and the United States in the South China Sea, the possible widening of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a possible new and sudden terrorist attack similar to 9/11, etc,\" he said.\n\nLiew, who is also a research fellow at the Centre for Market Education, said his GDP growth forecast is between 1% and 3% this year, which is relatively similar with the IMF's global economic growth prediction for this year.\n\nHe said other indicators to watch that may impact the local economy include global oil prices, particularly relevant due to the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. \"Additionally, trade tensions between major economies and changes in global supply chains could also influence Malaysia's export-oriented sectors.\n\n\"It is essential for the government to monitor these global economic dynamics closely as they will play crucial roles in determining the actual economic growth and currency strength of Malaysia in 2024,\" Liew said.\n\nOCBC's Venkateswaran said the bank is awaiting the announcement regarding the targeted fuel subsidies to gauge its impact on economy, adding that its house view is for the ringgit to trade at RM4.66 against the greenback by year-end, and with its end-2Q24 forecast at RM4.74.\n\nMARC's Choy said the planned subsidy rationalisation may weaken consumption due to a higher cost of living, although this may be mitigated by consumers reallocating how money is being spent within their personal budgets, leading to a limited net effect.\n\nHe expects the ringgit to improve to the range of RM4.4 to RM4.7 against the US dollar towards the second half, supported by US rate cuts, the implementation of Malaysia's structural reforms as well as a higher current account surplus caused by higher oil prices and exports.\n\nDownside risks on the ringgit would stem from the increased likelihood of fewer Fed rate cuts in 2024, which he said may result in a persistently wider interest rate differential compared to the United States, potentially leading to more outflows of foreign funds from the local market.\n\nOn the local currency, Afzanizam said: \"We are of the view that the US interest rates could be cut sometime in the 4Q24. \"Our sense is that the Fed has been reducing their balance sheet size from as high as US$.97 trillion in April 2022 to currently at US$7.41 trillion as of April this year.\n\n\"That's a US$1.56 trillion reduction in Fed's assets which are predominantly held in the form of US Treasury notes and bonds. Our estimates indicate that the quantitative tightening could end sometime September or October this year.\n\n\"Should the inflation continue to moderate and signs of economic weaknesses become more prevalent, we shall see the Fed start to cut the interest rate by then. That's our baseline narrative. On that note, the ringgit should appreciate towards the later part of 2024. We are projecting that the US dollar-ringgit exchange rate could end the year at RM4.65.\"\n\nMeanwhile, RAM's Woon said the timing of interest rate cuts in the United States remains one of the key risks on the horizon. The potential market volatility and ringgit weakness could introduce more widespread imported price pressures if prolonged, he said.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/04/29/2666933.png", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 452043696, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b48"}

Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes.\n\nChina's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to \"the relevant authorities\".\n\nThe People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nSANCTIONS WARNING\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed \"serious concern\" that Beijing was \"powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine\".\n\nStill, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping, was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.\n\nWhile officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the U.S. preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a U.S. official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, \"China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, \"Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security.\n\n\"Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBlinken made clear to Chinese officials \"that ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest,\" the spokesperson said. \"If China does not address this problem, the United States will.\"\n\nNearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.\n\nSome of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion.\n\nAmong the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.\n\nBy contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown.\n\n'CHANNEL CAN BE SHUT'\n\nThe four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies.\n\nSome rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.\n\nA chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name.\n\nCalls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.\n\nBOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said.\n\nThe manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.\n\n\"We gave up on the Russian market,\" the manager said. \"We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.\"\n\nWang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.\n\n\"I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,\" he said.\n\n\"What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future.

The word \"veterinarian\"...\n\nAs we celebrate the 2024 World Veterinary Day in Nigeria, a brief history of our profession for institutional memory will be appropriate.\n\nThe word \"veterinarian\" is from the Latin word veterinarius and came into use in the mid-1600s. Veterinary medicine at the beginning focused mainly on the health of horse stock because horses were used for transportation, labour and powering of most machinery. The iconic name of the steam locomotive is Iron Horse. Later on, the profession progressed into food-producing animals, followed by companion animals and eventually to the environment. However, the ultimate objective of the veterinary profession is serving humanity by ensuring the availability of wholesome commodities of animal origin, caring for working and companion animals for company, therapy, sports and recreation and ensuring sustainable ecosystems. This is what veterinarians sign up for.\n\nModern veterinary medicine began with the control of Rinderpest (cattle plague). The disease rinderpest was having a field day causing massive cattle deaths leading to human destitution and deaths in rural Europe until when in the 18th century, it invaded and devastated the Papal herds. Now the whole of Europe was appalled and Pope Clement XI was alarmed by the temerity of this plague in destroying the Papal herd.\n\nAll agreed that this plague has neither respect for constituted authority nor for religion and has now crossed the red line. The virus therefore attracted the Holy See dreadful curse. Our Fela's song entitled, 'Trouble Sleep Yanga Waken Am' aptly describes the situation.\n\nPope Clement XI immediately instructed his physician, Dr Giovanni Maria Lancisi, to prescribe measures for the suppression of the plague. Lancisi concluded that it was a contagion that is exceedingly fine and pernicious particles that pass from one body to another and called it Bovilla peste. His recommendations for its containment were; 1. slaughter to reduce spread (stamping out), 2. restricted movement of cattle (quarantine), 3. burial of whole animals in lime, and 4. inspection of meat. These recommendations were made in 1713 and to date remain the core principles of infectious animal disease control in Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThis led to the creation of the first Veterinary school on 4th August 1761 in Lyon, France. The 1st class of 38 students had ages ranging from 11-30 years and were admitted in 1762. The admission requirements were: 1. ability to read and write 2. evidence of baptism 3. certificate of good conduct 4. and a most, not a physician (So the Vets and Medics rivalry started from Day 1). Thereafter many vet schools were established in Europe but in Africa, the 1st Vet School was established in Egypt in 1827 while in Nigeria the 1st Vet faculty was established at the University of Ibadan in 1963 followed by Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria in 1965. Today there are 14 Veterinary faculties in Nigeria and the Veterinary Council of Nigeria (VCN), the regulatory board of the profession has over 10,500 qualified persons recorded in its register.\n\nTo combat rinderpest in Nigeria, the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) then referred to as Veterinary Department was established in Zaria, Northern Nigeria in 1924. Coincidentally in the same year, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) later changed to Word Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) a global authority on animal health, was also established in Paris, France. Both organizations, NVRI and WOAH celebrate their centenary this year.\n\nMass vaccination and movement control were the main tools used to control rinderpest in Nigeria. Vaccination was firstly, with anti-rinderpest hyper-immune serum before the introduction of Plowright's Tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (TCRV). The field use of TCRV started in 1956 and became the main vaccine used to eradicate rinderpest. With the advent of this efficacious vaccine and a better understanding of rinderpest epidemiology, experts in 1987 predicted that rinderpest is an eradicable disease. To accomplish that, FAO-Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) was developed in 1994. That was the beginning of the end of Rinderpest.\n\nIn Nigeria, after a series of mass vaccinations, the last confirmed outbreak of rinderpest was in 1987 and vaccination was therefore stopped on 1st April 1998. Globally rinderpest vaccination was all stopped in 2006. Since rinderpest had been eradicated in Europe, China, Russia and the Far East since the 1960s, declaration of global freedom from the disease was made in 2011.\n\nRinderpest is the second infectious disease but the first animal disease eradicated from the world, smallpox being the first. In 2012 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH, formerly OIE) established FAO-WOAH Rinderpest Joint Advisory Committee (JAC); a committee of seven international experts to advise the two organisations on post-eradication activities to maintain global freedom from rinderpest. JAC operated between 2012 to 2023 and its main mandate was to track and reduce global stocks of rinderpest virus-containing material (RVCM) especially those in unsafe holding facilities. This was successfully accomplished.\n\nOn global eradication of infectious diseases, the Vets and Medics have killed one disease each, namely rinderpest and smallpox, respectively and several more to go. Already, the second professional bout has commenced with medics having a head start on a second potential kill, namely the eradication of poliomyelitis (polio) but the Vets are not too far behind with the potential for double kill, the eradication of the Peste des petits ruminant (PPR) and Rabies by 2030.\n\nLest we forget, the Nigerian Vets had a history of local killing of another disease after which we went to sleep in celebration and unfortunately, the disease resurrected with a vengeance. Avian Influenza (AI) a viral disease posing a major threat to the national poultry industry with a potential for a global pandemic was detected in Nigeria in 2006. Against all odds, the Nigerian Vets with assistance of global partners stood up to the challenge and successfully managed and eradicated AI within two years (2006-2008) to the bewilderment of many sceptics. So Nigerian Vets have a reputation for achieving a difficult task if they are committed to it. Therefore, with the same dedication, Peste des petits ruminant and Rabies, the two diseases earmarked for global eradication can suffer the same fate. So, let's keep the vets/medic rivalry because it brings the best out of the two professions which is good for humanity and the world in general.

Pressure is building on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal that would free some Israeli hostages and bring a cease-fire in the war in Gaza. The White House says Biden reiterated his \"clear position\" as Israel plans to invade Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah despite global concern for more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering there.

Biden tries humor on the campaign trail\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is out to win some votes by scoring some laughs at the expense of Donald Trump. Biden is using mockery with the goal of getting under Trump's skin and reminding the country of Trump's blunders. Like a comic honing his routine, the Democratic president has been testing and expanding his jokes over the past few weeks. It started with jabs about his Republican opponent's financial problems, and now Biden regularly jeers Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and much more. The jokes are the latest attempt to crack the code on how to clap back at Trump, whose own schtick has redrawn the boundaries of what's acceptable in modern politics.\n\nDonald Trump is running against Joe Biden.

Trump likes to cite the 99-year-old Carter as a measuring stick to belittle Biden. Trump calls Carter a happy man because, according to Trump, Biden's performance in office makes Carter's presidency look good in comparison. It was once common for Republicans to mock Carter, who lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan in 1980 amid inflation, energy shortages and the Iran hostage crisis. Trump's implication is that Biden's economy makes Carter's look better. Federal figures show today's economy is stronger and more stable than in the late 1970s. And over the years, Carter's overall presidency has gotten stronger assessments from historians.\n\nTornadoes kill 4 in Oklahoma, leaving trail of destruction and thousands without power\n\nSULPHUR, Okla. (AP) -- Tornadoes have killed four people in Oklahoma and left thousands without power. The tornadoes began late Saturday night and left at least 100 people injured around Oklahoma. One tornado destroyed several downtown buildings in Sulphur, Oklahoma, flipping over cars and shearing rooftops off houses across a 15-block radius. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt toured the destruction on Sunday and said every business in the town of Sulphur appeared to have been destroyed. Oklahoma's severe weather adds to the dozens of reported tornadoes that have wreaked havoc in the nation's midsection since Friday. Authorities said Sunday that one person also died in Iowa because of the storms.\n\nPutin likely didn't order death of Russian opposition leader Navalny, US official says\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely didn't order the death of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny in February. An official says the U.S. intelligence community has found \"no smoking gun\" that Putin was aware of the timing of Navalny's death or directly ordered it. The official says it's believed Putin was ultimately responsible for the death of Navalny, who endured brutal conditions during his confinement. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. Navalny was Russia's best-known opposition politician and died while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he called politically motivated. A month later, Putin won reelection.\n\nPassage of harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law in Iraq draws diplomatic backlash\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) -- Human rights groups and diplomat have criticized a law that was quietly passed by the Iraqi parliament over the weekend that would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people. Although homosexuality is taboo in the largely conservative Iraqi society and political leaders have periodically launched anti-LGBTQ campaigns, Iraq did not previously have a law that explicitly criminalized it. The law passed Saturday with little notice as an amendment to the country's existing anti-prostitution law, imposes a sentence of 10 to 15 years for same-sex relations and a prison term of one to three years for people who undergo or perform gender-transition surgeries and for \"intentional practice of effeminacy.\"\n\nAfrican farmers look to the past and the future to address climate change\n\nHARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- From ancient fertilizer methods in Zimbabwe to new greenhouse technology in Somalia, farmers across the heavily agriculture-reliant African continent are looking both to the past and future to respond to climate change. Africa has the world's youngest population. It is seeing the worst effects of a warming planet while contributing the least to the problem. Farmers are scrambling to make sure the booming population is fed. Some are turning to traditional foods that had been long dismissed as weeds or neglected in favor of imports. Others embrace new planting methods and varieties. One new bean's side benefit is less flatulence.\n\nObstacles remain as women seek more leadership roles in America's Black Church\n\nThroughout its long history, the Black Church in America has - for the most part - been a patriarchal institution, with men making up the vast majority of its ranks of clergy. These days, increasing numbers of Black women are attending seminary, and some women are carving out high-profile leadership roles. The African Methodist Episcopal Church says it has more than 1,000 female pastors. But obstacles remain. The founder of a group called Women of Color in Ministry estimates that less than one in 10 Black Protestant congregations are led by a woman.\n\nCandace Parker, a 3-time WNBA champion and 2-time Olympic gold medalist, announces retirement\n\nThree-time WNBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Candace Parker has announced she's retiring after 16 seasons.

The World Flight Across Russia was the idea of Marcel Large, President of Raid Intl. and organizer of many car, motorcycle and air rallies for decades prior to our event.\n\nHatched after taking the first private group of general aviation aircraft into the Soviet Union in early 1991, he wanted it to go beyond just flying around the world across Soviet Union. Designed as a annual event, with a different group flying a different route across the Soviet Union each summer, it ended up being across Russia and only took place that one honeymoon summer right after the collapse in July 1992.\n\nA fascinating part of the story was Marcel, his wife Michelle, Eric Vercesi and Paul Hollenbeck dealing with Soviet and then Russian authorities with no one truly knowing who could answer the most pressing questions at hand.\n\nMoscow, January 1992: Four people were in Moscow, weeks after the Soviet Union voted itself out of business, trying to organize a World Flight Across Russia. Confusion reigned supreme six months after hard-liners tried to reverse all those gains made during Gorbachev's reforms, when Boris Yeltsin and the people made their famous stand for freedom in August 1991. Odds were stacked against their success as the world was still reeling from one amazingly startling fact: The Cold War had just ended!\n\nThe '1st Annual Around the World Air Rally' was the first western or civilian group of general aviation aircraft to circumnavigate while crossing the entire landmass of Russia, but that is only part of the story.

Hundreds of students are being arrested in universities across the United States. In Spain, hundreds of thousands have protested since the beginning of the war, while in Sanaa, Yemen, over a million people gathered last week to protest the US-backed genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe pseudo-left Revolutionary Left (IR) group, the former Spanish affiliate of both the International Marxist Tendency (IMT) and the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI), is suddenly trying to distance itself from PSOE-Sumar government, and its main ally in parliament, Podemos. All these parties are accomplices in the Israeli genocide against the Palestinians.\n\nUnder first the PSOE-Podemos government (2020-2023), and now the PSOE-Sumar government, IR backed these parties of capitalist government and worked to block working class opposition on their left. Both governments increased trade, military, and economic relations with the Zionist regime, particularly in arms. Under PSOE-Podemos, Spain sold weapons to Israel worth hundreds of millions of euros while Madrid spent millions buying weapons with the \"combat-tested\" mark. The PSOE-Sumar government kept buying and selling millions of euros worth of weaponry from Israel.\n\nIR is now attempting to distance itself from these parties, to hide its support for parties complicit in the genocide. In \"PSOE-Sumar, the NATO Government and the militarism,\" IR states:\n\n[W]e cannot place any trust in a government that has demonstrated ad nauseam that it operates for the interests of the capitalists and follows the directives of imperialist masters in Washington. Likewise, other political forces, such as [Podemos], which no longer bear governmental responsibilities but center their entire strategy on institutional action, do not present a viable alternative. Many of the aggressive measures mentioned were endorsed while Podemos held ministerial positions, and their current critique, devoid of any assumption of responsibility, only exacerbates their credibility crisis.\n\nMilitarism is an organic feature of social democracy. Historically, they have consistently acquiesced to the ruling class, and this tendency persists in their current bellicose stance in Ukraine, their NATO alignment, and their complicity with the Zionist genocide. This leftist faction does not constitute part of the solution but rather contributes to the problem.\n\nIR is running from Podemos like rats fleeing from a sinking ship. IR knows Podemos and Sumar's support is plummeting to all-time lows. In the regional elections held this year in Galicia and the Basque Country, Podemos failed to win any seats. Eight years before, Podemos was the most voted party in the Basque Country. The polls are equally dire for the upcoming European elections, where Podemos is expected to receive 2.3 percent of the vote, down from 10 percent in 2019.\n\nSumar, a split-off from Podemos ruling with the PSOE at national level, is also collapsing. It did not obtain any lawmakers in Galicia and only one seat in the Basque Country. It is polling at 2.9 percent in European elections.\n\nThe crisis of the main \"Left Populist\" parties of bourgeois rule in Spain is exposing IR's own bankruptcy. Over the past decade, IR has been one of the greatest cheerleaders of Podemos and its participation in a PSOE-led government. In 2019, when Podemos entered into government, IR wrote that this \"represents an event of historical significance which has raised enormous expectations.\" Such a government,\" they said, was \"the result of the great mass mobilization that has shaken the Spanish State.\"\n\nDespite Podemos' flagrantly right-wing policies -- raising the military budget, slashing pensions and wages, providing billions of euros in corporate bailouts and pursuing a profits-over-lives policy in the COVID-19 pandemic that cost over 140,000 lives -- IR kept working as a de facto faction of Podemos.\n\nIR threw all its strength into supporting the leader and founder of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, in the Madrid regional elections in 2021. It called for a Podemos vote with posters larger than those of the pseudo-left party itself. They boasted of hanging 11,000 posters and distributing more than 121,000 pamphlets backing Iglesias.\n\nOver the next years, the PSOE-Podemos government escalated its war at home and abroad. It provided hundreds of millions in weaponry to the far-right Ukrainian regime in the NATO war against Russia, massacred refugees on Spain's borders, imposed minimum service requirements on air crews, and attacked striking truck drivers and metal workers. All the while, it intensified its support for the far-right Netanyahu government, despite it brutal occupation of Gaza that led to the October 7 uprising against Israel.\n\nNonetheless, IR once again called the \"left\" to rally behind the PSOE-Sumar government after last year's elections. In November 2023, the PSOE and Sumar formed a new coalition government, without Podemos. Soon after, IR posted an article titled \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez supports his investiture: a Government for social peace and collaboration with imperialism.\" While admitting the reactionary character of the PSOE-Sumar government, IR continued:\n\n\"Despite everything, the constitution of a PSOE-Sumar Government appears in the eyes of a large majority of our class as a million times preferable to a PP-Vox Government. From Revolutionary Left we perfectly understand this opinion. Of course, it would be profoundly wrong for the left-wing forces with parliamentary representation to deny their critical support for S\u00e1nchez's investiture!\"\n\nSoon after, IR welcomed Podemos' exit from government as many of its voters joined pro-Palestinian protests. The largest and most sustained anti-war movement since the Vietnam War era was erupting around the world, with millions participating in protests. IR stated \"From Revolutionary Left we welcome this decision, and we say that it has to be the beginning of a real break with the social democratic policies of that left that has become an essential prop of capitalist rule...\"\n\nPodemos left government not because it opposed the genocide in Gaza, austerity or militarism, all of which it supported from 2020 to 2023. To make clear its continuing support for the PSOE and Sumar, Podemos leader Ione Belarra declared that \"the democratic forces [Podemos, PSOE and Sumar] must work together\" against the far-right.\n\nIR now is following the exact same path. It is distancing itself from Podemos, the same way Podemos took distance from the PSOE-Sumar government. However, it aims not to mobilize working class opposition to the PSOE-Sumar government, but to guard the left flank of the pseudo-left parties tasked with defending the strategic interests of Spanish imperialism.\n\nIR is promoting regionalist and nationalist forces that defend the PSOE-Sumar government in parliament. For the Galician elections, it called for a vote to the Nationalist Galician Bloc (BNG), stating: \"It would be very important to strengthen street action and demand from day one that a BNG-PSOE Government fulfills its promises.\" In the Basque country it called to vote for the Basque-nationalist EH Bildu party, arguing, \"we are not abstentionists, and that is why we ask for a critical vote for EH Bildu.\"\n\nBoth parties have supported the PSOE-Podemos and the PSOE-Sumar governments in hiking military expenditure to record levels and turning Spain into a spearhead of NATO against Russia in Ukraine.\n\nIR justifies its support for these parties under the idea that \"Revolutionary communists, Leninists, have never championed abstentionism\" in elections. This is a shameless and miserable charade. IR has never been a Marxist organization. This organization traces its roots back to a British-based group led by Ted Grant that broke with Trotskyism and split from the Fourth International in the late 1940s.\n\nThe Grant group subsequently became among the most vociferous promoters of Pabloism, which the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was formed to fight in 1953. Adapting to the post-Second World War social order, the Pabloites wrote off the working class as an independent revolutionary force. They argued that the Stalinist bureaucracy, bourgeois nationalist movements in the colonial countries, and the union and social-democratic bureaucracies would be transformed under mass pressure into revolutionary organizations.\n\nGrant and his followers developed \"entryism\" as a permanent strategic orientation. They aimed not at politically educating workers through a struggle against the pro-capitalist bureaucracies, but to keep radicalized workers within the confines of the Labour Party and trade union bureaucracies.\n\nIn Spain, IR demanded that workers and youth should subordinate themselves to the PSOE in the 1980s, then the Stalinist-led United Left and then Podemos since 2014. Now, faced with the growing collapse of Podemos, IR is searching for new tools to prop up the discredited PSOE-Sumar government.\n\nMobilizing the working class to halt the genocide requires breaking with the nationalist outlook of pseudo-left groups that subordinate workers to the Spanish capitalist state. Only an international, independent movement of the working class can halt arms deliveries to Israel, stop repression of protests, and end the wars. The political basis of such a movement is the International Committee of the Fourth International's struggle to expose pseudo-left tendencies such as IR and build sections of the ICFI in Spain and internationally as the revolutionary leadership of the working class.\n\nRead moreSpain's Podemos politically complicit in the genocide of Palestinians15 March 2024Podemos electoral debacle in Spain exposes bankruptcy of Revolutionary Left (IR) group22 June 2023Spain's pseudo-left Revolutionary Left promotes M\u00e9lenchon in France, Podemos government at home24 May 2023Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:SpainThe Politics of the Pseudo-LeftStop Israel's genocide in Gaza!Europe", "source": {"uri": "wsws.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Socialist"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.wsws.org/asset/85fd71dc-feed-499c-a233-8b8fb336c260?rendition=1600x900", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 452043174, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b50"}

But the \"humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire,\" the aid group's chief operating officer, Erin Gore, said in a statement.\n\n\"We are restarting our operation with the same energy, dignity and focus on feeding as many people as possible,\" she said.\n\nThe aid group said it had distributed more than 43 million meals in Gaza so far and that it had trucks carrying the equivalent of nearly 8 million meals waiting to enter the enclave through the Rafah crossing in the south. World Central Kitchen said it was also planning to send trucks to Gaza through Jordan and that it would open a kitchen in Muwasi, a small seaside village that the Israeli military designated as a \"humanitarian zone\" safe for civilians, though attacks there have continued.\n\nSix of the seven workers killed on April 1 were from Western nations -- three from Britain, one from Australia, one from Poland, and one with dual citizenship of the U.S. and Canada. The seventh was Palestinian. They were killed in back-to-back Israeli drone strikes on their vehicles as they traveled toward Rafah after unloading food aid that had arrived by sea.\n\nThe attack prompted the World Central Kitchen to immediately suspend its operations in Gaza and elicited outrage from some of Israel's closest allies.\n\nThe World Central Kitchen convoy's movements had been coordinated in advance with the Israeli military, but some officers had not reviewed the coordination documentation detailing which cars were part of the convoy, the military said.\n\nAbout 200 aid workers, most of them Palestinians, were killed in Gaza between Oct. 7 and the attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy, according to the United Nations. A New York Times visual investigation showed that, well before the World Central Kitchen attack, six aid groups in Gaza had come under Israeli fire despite sharing their locations with the Israeli military.\n\nThe episode forced World Central Kitchen to decide between ending its efforts in Gaza or continuing, \"knowing that aid, aid workers and civilians are being intimidated and killed,\" Gore said in the statement.\n\n\"Ultimately, we decided that we must keep feeding, continuing our mission of showing up to provide food to people during the toughest of times,\" she said.\n\nAt a memorial in Washington for the World Central Kitchen workers Thursday, the group's founder, celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, said that there were \"many unanswered questions about what happened and why\" and that the aid group was still demanding an independent investigation into the Israeli military's actions.\n\nThe seven aid workers had \"risked everything to feed people they did not know and will never meet,\" Andr\u00e9s said. \"They were the best of humanity.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Advertiser-thumbnail-image.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520627", "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 452044592, "relevance": 6, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b52"}

But, really, it came down to only two men: Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nWashington's annual mashup of political humor and earnest paeans to the free press is typically a good-natured collection of one-liners and affectionate jabs at friends and enemies alike. But it was the leading 2024 presidential contenders who loomed largest - one in the Washington Hilton hotel ballroom, the other who definitely, positively, probably was not watching from Mar-a-Lago. Unless, of course, he was.\n\n\"The 2024 election is in full swing and, yes, age is an issue,\" President Biden told the black-tie crowd. \"I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.\"\n\n\"Can we just acknowledge how refreshing it is,\" comedian Colin Jost later added, \"to see a president of the United States at an event that doesn't begin with a bailiff saying, 'All rise!'\"\n\nFor most of the evening, Trump ignored the dinner and posted instead about presidential immunity and political witch hunts. Shortly after 1 a.m., he finally chimed in on Truth Social: \"The White House Correspondents' Dinner was really bad. Colin Jost BOMBED, and Crooked Joe was an absolute disaster! Doesn't get much worse than this!\"\n\nSo, basically, another day on the campaign trail.\n\nBut for the denizens of Washington's political media, it was a special occasion. The correspondents' dinner is ostensibly a playful celebration of the codependent relationship between Washington politicians and reporters who spend the rest of the year covering them and deadly serious issues: Trump's legal trials, looming uncertainty about what will happen in November (and beyond), the Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIt proved hard to put all that aside for the night. Especially Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protesters surrounded the entrance outside of the hotel, shouting chants such as, \"Western media, you can't hide! We charge you with genocide!\" and confronting guests arriving to the dinner in their tuxedos and gowns. Some attendees were followed by tight circles of protesters yelling \"Shame!\" inches from their faces until they could get behind police.\n\n\"I came in through a different entrance, so I didn't hear exactly what they are chanting,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), running up an escalator to the lobby. \"But there are tens of thousands of people being blown to bits in Gaza, so I understand why they are protesting. I stand with the movement - depending on what they are saying.\"\n\nThe experience of walking the gantlet of activists seemed to have left a lot of people somewhat stunned. But inside the ballroom, it was all smiles and hugs and back slaps.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) charmed everyone, wearing a big smile and a \"FREE EVAN\" pin in honor of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) gave a report on his own encounter with the protesters outside: \"I asked them about what was happening in Sudan. And they yelled louder. And then I asked them about the concentration camps full of Uyghurs. And they yelled louder. And then I went inside.\" Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for New York Magazine, got off a presidential zinger of her own: \"I can't hear a thing in here - I feel like Biden.\"\n\nBiden's own zingers were directed almost entirely at his opponent.\n\n\"Trump's so desperate, he started reading those Bibles he's selling,\" the president said. \"Then he got to the First Commandment: 'You shall have no other gods before me.' That's when he put it down and said, 'This book's not for me.'\"\n\nBut the president soon dispensed with the yuks and pivoted to what felt like a stump speech about the clear and present danger posed by Trump and his movement. He called on the journalists in the room to report \"truth over lies.\" He implored them to move past the election horse race stories and focus on American democracy. \"The stakes couldn't be higher,\" he said. No punchline.\n\nOfficially, the evening is nonpartisan, and the only toast of the night goes to the sitting president, regardless of party affiliation. Unofficially, the dinner has always been perceived as a hotbed of Washington elites who lean left, regardless of media affiliation.\n\nTrump, who was famously roasted by President Barack Obama at the 2011 dinner, never attended the event as president. His relentless criticism of the mainstream media caused many news organizations to threaten a boycott of the dinner in 2017; Trump announced that he would not attend. He skipped two following years and even counterprogrammed with a MAGA rally instead. The party soldiered on, reinforcing a commitment to the role of a free press in a democracy, and many breathed a not-so-discreet sigh of relief when the crowd resumed in 2022 after the worst of the pandemic with Biden carrying the torch.\n\nThe only Trump spotted at this year's festivities was daughter-in-law Lara Trump, recently crowned co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Her father-in-law wasn't in the building, but comic impressionist Matt Friend emerged from the crowd with a Trump impersonation - as well as sendups of Bernie Sanders, Mitch McConnell and Obama. He also made the first (and, surprisingly, only) dead-dog joke of the night.\n\n\"I am killing this dinner harder than Kristi Noem kills the puppies,\" Friend said in his Trump voice, riffing off the news that the Republican governor of South Dakota, in a forthcoming book, admits to shooting her 14-month-old dog because she was \"untrainable\" and aggressive.\n\nLet's face it: It's a tough room for a comedian. Jost, co-anchor of \"Saturday Night Live's\" \"Weekend Update,\" sat at the head table next to the president and nearby first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and WHCA President Kelly O'Donnell, senior White House correspondent for NBC News. His speech came after Biden's and felt like one of his SNL bits: Some jokes got laughs, others landed awkwardly.\n\nThere were a few jabs at Biden, a \"decent\" man who Jost said reminds him of his beloved grandfather, a Staten Island firefighter. There were also some uneven one-liners about the press, but the press never laughs at itself, so it's hard to know whether they were good or bad jokes.\n\nJost took several swipes at the former president, too: \"I love that Trump's two attacks on Biden are that he's a senile old man and a criminal mastermind. I think you've got to pick one. Personally, I don't know any criminal masterminds who bike to get ice cream.\" On the courtroom drawings that have emerged from the trials: \"Every sketch of Trump looks like the Grinch had sex with the Lorax.\"\n\nJost brought the evening's most glamorous celebrity: movie star Scarlett Johansson, whom he married in 2020. What started a century ago as an annual gathering of reporters and their subjects morphed into the \"Nerd Prom\" about 35 years ago - a red carpet extravaganza where news organizations battle to host administration officials, Hollywood A-listers, corporate heavyweights and anyone else basking in their 15 minutes of fame. Within the throngs are a few people who actually work as White House correspondents.\n\nWith some exceptions, this year's guest list fell solidly into B-list territory: Jon Hamm, Chris Pine, Keri Russell, Molly Ringwald, Rosario Dawson, Jon Cryer, Caitlyn Jenner, Billy Porter, Lorne Michaels.\n\nBefore the speeches, the WHCA handed out its awards for excellence. The award for overall excellence went to Barak Ravid of Axios, Peter Baker of the New York Times received the print award for deadline reporting, and Tamara Keith of NPR received the broadcast award in the same category - all singled out for stories following Hamas's Oct. 7 attack in Israel. Doug Mills of the Times got the award for visual journalism for a striking photo of Biden, and the award for courage and accountability went to The Washington Post for coverage on the impact of assault rifles and mass shootings.\n\nThe evening ended, as it always does: with an impassioned defense of democracy and the critical role of the press in preserving it.\n\nJost had his own thoughts about the media. \"Your words speak truth to power. Your words bring light to the darkness.\" Then he paused and grinned, \"And most importantly, your words train the AI programs that will soon replace you.\"\n\nBiden ended with a toast of his own: \"To a free press. To an informed citizenry. To an America where freedom and democracy endure. God bless America.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/28/PDTN/73494894007-correspondents-j-3-pv-7-iolqtjwhe-6-wb-6-pgwqwow-4.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3497,1968,x0,y304&format=pjpg&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-9519637", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 452044548, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b53"}

Hunger has been a particular problem in the northern Gaza Strip as the destruction of roads and infrastructure has isolated areas around Gaza City.Analysis from the group Integrated Food Security Phase Classification projected that half of people in the Gaza Strip would face \"catastrophic\" levels of malnutrition by mid-July if trends continued. All 2.2 million people in the enclave would be unable to fully meet nutritional needs necessary to maintain good health.Gore added that aid workers are still under threat in Gaza, likely contributing to the group's decision to fully delegate its work to local Palestinians for now.The group is still calling for \"an impartial and international investigation into the IDF attack\" in which Israeli drones targeted three separate vehicles in the organization's aid convoy, continuously targeting survivors of the first two strikes as they scrambled to flee the attack.The incident generated outrage in the West and among liberal US lawmakers in particular as WCK's founder, celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, is a personal friend of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other high-profile Democratic Party leaders. The incident prompted former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, among 40 other top Democrats, to sign onto a letter urging Biden to halt weapons transfers to Israel without human rights guarantees.Some observers claimed a double standard in media coverage of the attack, which killed six white foreign aid workers and their Palestinian driver. On the day of the Israeli drone strike against the organization the death toll among Gazans stood at an estimated 32,845.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_miles@sputnikglobe.com", "name": "John Miles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1118167268.jpg?11181670931714348398", "eventUri": "eng-9520627", "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 452044469, "relevance": 6, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b55"}

In a January 2021 poll taken just before Trump left office and days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, 55% considered his time as president a failure.\n\n61% say Biden's presidency thus far has been a failure, while 39% say it's been a success. That's narrowly worse than the 57% who called the first year of his administration a failure in January 2022, with 41% calling it a success.\n\nRepublicans now are more unified around the idea that Trump's presidency was a success than Democrats are that Biden's has been one. Overall, 92% of Republicans call Trump's time in office a success, while just 73% of Democrats say Biden's has been a success so far. Among independents, 51% say Trump's presidency was successful, while only 37% see Biden's as a success.\n\n45% approve of Biden's handling of health care policy and 44% approve of his handling of student loan debt.\n\nBiden's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and a majority disapproval among Democrats (53%).\n\nA broad majority of all Americans, 70%, say economic conditions in the US are poor, with many, particularly Republicans, who feel that way saying their views would be more affected by a political shift than a change in the economy itself.\n\nAmong all voters, when independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are included in the matchup, Trump holds 42% to Biden's 33%, with Kennedy at 16%, West at 4% and Stein at 3%.

I looked at the faces of my wife and children, huddled in the bitter cold in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and felt helpless.\n\nMy 19-year-old twins, Zakia and Batoul, lay on the pavement alongside my daughter, Yumna, who is 14, my son Mohamed, who is eight and my youngest girl, Razan, aged five, with their mother, Zaynab.\n\nAs we tried to rest outside the Palestinian Red Crescent Society's headquarters, the sounds of shelling echoed through the night and drones buzzed overhead.\n\nWe had managed to find an apartment to rent, but the landlord had called earlier that day, saying the Israeli military had warned him the building would be bombed. I was working at the time, but my family grabbed their bags and fled.\n\nWe met up at the Red Crescent headquarters, which was already overflowing with displaced people.\n\nMy brother and I sat on cardboard boxes all night, discussing what we should do.\n\nWe had fled our homes in the town of Jabalia a few days earlier, on 13 October, leaving most of our possessions behind, after the Israeli military told everyone in northern Gaza to move south for safety.\n\nAnd now we had just escaped being bombed in the area we had been told to move to. It was hard to think straight. I felt angry, humiliated and terrible that I could not provide any protection for my family.\n\nEventually, my family moved to an apartment in Nuseirat in central Gaza, while I stayed with the BBC team in a tent at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. I visited every few days.\n\nCommunication was difficult, with internet and phone signals sometimes cut. Once I did not hear from my family for four or five days.\n\nIn Khan Younis, the BBC team - about seven of us - lived on one meal a day. Even when there was food, sometimes we did not eat it because there was hardly anywhere to go to the toilet.\n\nDuring this time my friend, Al Jazeera bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh, suffered a terrible loss.\n\nThe house his family had been staying in was hit in an Israeli air strike. His wife, teenage son, seven-year-old daughter and one-year-old grandson were killed.\n\nThe Israeli military says it takes \"feasible precautions\" to reduce civilian casualties, and in this case had \"targeted Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area\".\n\nReporting Gaza: My War\n\nIn Gaza, Palestinian journalists document the war as they live it on a daily basis. In this BBC World Service film, we hear the story of BBC Arabic's Reporter in Gaza, Adnan El-Bursh who found himself reporting the news, as he was living through it.\n\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK)\n\nI watched the footage of my friend, who I have known for 20 years, embracing his children's shroud-wrapped bodies in central Gaza. I wished I was there with him.\n\nThe news came amid a string of reports about the deaths of other friends, relatives and neighbours. My heart ached. I have now lost about 200 people in the war.\n\nThat day I wept live on air, as I was reporting. In the night, I woke up with tears covering my cheeks. Wael's image never left my mind.\n\nI have covered conflicts in Gaza for 15 years, but this war stands apart, from the unprecedented attack that triggered it, to the scale of the losses.\n\nAt 06:15 on 7 October I was woken by loud explosions and my children screaming. I went up to the rooftop and saw rockets being launched towards Israel from Gaza.\n\nWhen we realised Hamas had breached the fence into Israel - in its assault that saw about 1,200 people killed and 250 taken hostage - we knew the response from Israel would be like nothing we had seen before.\n\nMore than 34,000 people have now been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The risk of injury and death has been ever-present.\n\nTwo days into the war, I hurried to our local market in Jabalia, to stock up with food. It was busy with others doing the same.\n\nBut the area was bombed heavily just 10 minutes after I left. The entire place was destroyed, including the large grocery store where I had shopped moments earlier.\n\nI knew the faces of the shop owners. Many of them were among the dead.\n\nAmnesty International says at least 69 people were killed in the attack and that it should be investigated as a war crime.\n\nThe Israeli military has not responded to the BBC's question about this incident.\n\nThroughout the war it has said its operation is targeting Hamas, which it says operates from civilian locations.\n\nIt also says \"strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law\".\n\nBefore the war, Jabalia was a beautiful, tranquil town. I was born there and had been living a simple, contented life with my family, filled with love and plans for the future.\n\nI had a farm east of the town, where I had planted olive, lemon, and orange trees with my own hands. It was peaceful and I loved to drink tea there after work.\n\nThe day we decided to flee northern Gaza for Khan Younis - leaving our homes and the BBC office in Gaza City behind - was a pivotal moment in my life.\n\nWith more than 10 people crammed into one car, my family and I crawled our way south, along a single road, with tens of thousands of other people, on foot and in vehicles, all loaded with belongings.\n\nThe journey was punctuated by air strikes on nearby areas on both sides of the road. Confusion, grief and uncertainty marked the faces of my family and the crowds.\n\nThe children kept asking me: \"Where are we going? Will we be back tomorrow?\"\n\nI really wish I had taken our photo album, full of pictures of me as a young child, my parents, and my wife and I when we got engaged. My dad was an Arabic teacher and I also wish I had taken some of his books that I kept after he died.\n\nLater, I learned from a neighbour that my house had been completely destroyed, and my farm burned.\n\nAfter that terrifying and surreal journey south, and our night outside the Red Crescent headquarters, I continued working from Khan Younis for several weeks. My family were still in Nuseirat and being separated from them took a toll emotionally.\n\nThen, in early December, Israel began telling Gazans to leave parts of Khan Younis and move to other areas, including Rafah, further south.\n\nThe Israeli military also closed the main road leading north, which connected me and my family. I did not know how I would get to them or where we should go if I did. Rafah was already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of people, and there was barely anywhere to stay.\n\nFor days, I grappled with swirling emotions. News circulated about Israeli forces advancing towards the main roads, apparently aiming to divide the south from the central and northern regions. I was terrified that I - or my family - would be killed and we would never see each other again.\n\nFor the first time I felt like I had lost it. I did not even know what day it was. I considered stopping work and returning to my family. If we died, we would die together.\n\nIn the end, on 11 December, I drove with a colleague along a back road to Nuseirat. When I arrived, my youngest children rushed up to hug me, with Razan reaching round my neck and holding on tight.\n\nWe managed to move the family to Rafah. The BBC team had also relocated there, continuing to report. There were some awful moments.\n\nIn late December, I reported as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) handed about 80 bodies to the authorities in Gaza. The IDF said it had taken them from Gaza to Israel so they could be checked to see if there were any hostages among them.\n\nA large lorry drove into the cemetery in the Rafah area. The stench was overwhelming when the container was opened. Men in aprons and masks placed the remains, wrapped in blue plastic, in a mass grave dug by an excavator in the sandy ground.\n\nI had never seen a scene like that before. It is hard to describe how horrible it was.\n\nThen, in January, I was reporting from a hospital in Rafah when several bodies were brought in, including another of Wael Al-Dahdouh's sons, Hamza, his eldest, who was also a journalist working for Al Jazeera.\n\nWho would tell Wael? It just seemed impossible, after the tragedies he had already faced. I could not even listen as one of my colleagues called someone close to Wael to pass on the news.\n\nHamza and his colleague, freelance videographer Mustafa Thuraya, were killed in an Israeli air strike on their car, after they had reported on the aftermath of another strike in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military alleges they were \"were members of Gaza-based terrorist organisations\". The families and Al Jazeera reject the claims as false.\n\nThe IDF says the two were operating drones \"posing an imminent threat to IDF troops\", but a Washington Post investigation \"found no indications that either man was operating as anything other than a journalist that day\".\n\nMore than 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to Reporters Without Borders - the vast majority are known to be Palestinian.\n\nThe IDF says it \"has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists\".\n\nIt says it \"takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists\", but \"remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks\".\n\nEventually, the news came that the BBC team's families had permission to leave Gaza. Four weeks later, we too finally left through the Rafah crossing, facilitated by the Egyptian authorities.\n\nI am writing this in Qatar. But I know that in Jabalia, they have been pulling up grass and grinding animal feed to eat, while I'm here having meals in a clean hotel. I find it hard to eat - it's like eating poison.\n\nThe future is a blur. Gaza is my life. I want to return one day, but for now, that seems impossible.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/032139515394448c7c70cd03eb8936bc", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 452044077, "relevance": 13, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b5b"}

About 275 people were arrested on Saturday at various campuses including Indiana University at Bloomington, Arizona State University and Washington University in St. Louis. The number of arrests nationwide approached 900 since New York police removed a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at Columbia University and arrested more than 100 demonstrators on April 18.\n\nSince then, students have dug in at dozens of pro-Palestinian encampments around the country, prompting a range of responses from administrators: arrests and criminal charges, student suspensions or simply continued pleas to leave. The plight of students has become a central part of protests, with both the students and a growing number of faculty demanding amnesty for protesters. At issue is whether the suspensions and legal records will follow students through their adult lives.\n\nFaculty members at universities in California, Georgia and Texas have initiated or passed largely symbolic votes of no confidence in their leadership.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said President Joe Biden \"knows that there are very strong feelings\" but would leave managing the protests to local authorities.\n\n\"People should have the ability to air their views and to share their perspectives publicly but it has to be peaceful,\" Kirby said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called it \"a dangerous situation\" and placed the responsibility with college administrators.\n\n\"There's also antisemitism, which is completely unacceptable. I've been shocked to see that in this country,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"HOW IT STARTED\n\nEarly protests at Columbia University in New York City sparked pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the country and students and administrators there have engaged in negotiations, the university said in a statement Saturday night.\n\nColumbia has set a series of deadlines for protesters to leave the encampment -- which they have missed -- but bringing back police \"at this time\" would be counterproductive, the school wrote in an email to students.\n\nOn Sunday, students walked among dozens of colorful tents that continue to stand.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, police set up barricades before hundreds of demonstrators on both sides joined a growing crowd Sunday near where pro-Palestinian students have been staying around-the-clock in tents. Counter-protesters who organized a \"Stand in Support of Jewish Students\" rally said their goal was to \"stand up against hatred and antisemitism.\"\n\nAcross town, the University of Southern California said it was open Sunday after being shut down a day earlier because of what the university called vandalism and disruptions.\n\nUSC drew criticism after refusing to allow the valedictorian, who has publicly supported the Palestinian cause, to make a commencement speech. Administrators then scrapped the keynote speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu. Last week the school announced the cancelation of its main graduation event, a day after more than 90 protesters were arrested by police in riot gear.\n\nIn the northern part of the state, officials on Saturday ordered an \"enforced hard closure\" of California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. Two halls remained occupied by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. The school said Sunday that the cost of the occupation -- including damage done by \"theft, vandalism and graffiti\" -- was estimated to be in the millions.\n\nMISSOURI\n\nWashington University in St. Louis locked some campus buildings and arrested protesters Saturday. Photos showed uniformed police attempting to remove masked protesters as others, also wearing masks, linked arms to thwart the efforts.\n\nIn a statement, the university said more than 100 people -- including 23 students and four university employees -- were arrested on suspicion of trespassing. Megan Green, president of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen, said in a social media post that she was present and the protest remained calm \"until the police came in like an ambush.\"\n\nGreen Party presidential candidate Jill Stein said in a social media post that she and two of her campaign managers were among those arrested.\n\nThe university's statement defended the action and said protesters \"did not have good intentions on our campus and that this demonstration had the potential to get out of control and become dangerous.\"\n\nSome arrested also face charges of resisting arrest and assault, including for injuries to three police officers, the statement said. Those injuries include a severe concussion, a broken finger and a groin injury.\n\nThe Missouri chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the arrests as \"heavy-handed.\"\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nIn Boston, police in riot gear cleared an encampment on the campus of Northeastern University on Saturday.\n\nMassachusetts State Police said about 102 protesters were arrested and will be charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct.\n\nNortheastern said in a statement that the demonstration, which began two days ago, had become \"infiltrated by professional organizers\" with no affiliation to the university and antisemitic slurs, including \"kill the Jews,\" had been used.\n\nThe Huskies for a Free Palestine student group disputed the university's account, saying in a statement that counterprotesters were to blame for the slurs and no student protesters \"repeated the disgusting hate speech.\"\n\nStudents at the Boston protest said a counterprotester attempted to instigate hate speech but insisted their event was peaceful.\n\nUS CAMPUSES AND THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza. Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza. In the ensuing war, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.\n\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while critics of Israel say it uses such allegations to silence opponents. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

There are no major issues in the observations and inquiries submitted by Hamas regarding the contents\" of the proposal, said the Hamas official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official added that a Hamas delegation led by the movement's senior leader, Khalil al-Hayya, will deliver the group's response to the truce proposal during a meeting with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo on Monday.\n\nEgypt has also invited the Israeli delegation to travel to Cairo on Monday to \"speed up the process and provide the necessary clarifications,\" according to an Egyptian source quoted by Qatari-owned outlet Al-Arabi Al-Jadid.\n\nEgypt, which along with Qatar and the United States has been unsuccessfully trying to broker a new Gaza truce deal ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November, sent a high-level delegation to Israel on Friday to discuss the latest proposal.\n\nDuring his call with Netanyahu, the White House said Biden highlighted the joint statement he organized last week with the leaders of 17 other countries, demanding Hamas immediately release the remaining 133 hostages it is holding in Gaza in what would allow for an immediate ceasefire and relief for civilians in the Strip.\n\nThe US president also reiterated his \"ironclad\" commitment to Israel's security, which was on display during the jointly thwarted Iranian missile and drone attack earlier this month, according to the White House readout.\n\nThe White House added that Biden reiterated his \"clear position\" on Israel's looming plans to invade Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. The US has said it cannot support the operation unless it ensures the full protection of the over one million Palestinians sheltering there and doesn't believe that Israel will be able to safely evacuate and care for that many civilians.\n\nThe two leaders also discussed the opening of additional crossings into northern Gaza later this week to allow more aid into the Strip, which will be critical if Israel goes ahead with its plans for the Rafah operation.\n\nIsrael is among the countries US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit as he returns to the Middle East on Monday, on his seventh trip to the region since October 7. The US State Department said Blinken was scheduled to visit Israel and Jordan on Wednesday.\n\nThe terms of the current Israeli-backed proposal have not been published but are reported to provide for the release of 33 living hostages who meet a so-called \"humanitarian\" designation -- that is, women, children, men aged over 50 and the sick. In return, Israel would release a far larger number of Palestinian security prisoners, including many with blood on their hands.\n\nAmid fierce debate within the Israeli government as the diplomatic efforts for a deal stepped up over the weekend, Hebrew media channels reported that Jerusalem was willing to make further major concessions such as allowing the return of residents to northern Gaza, and possibly to do so without the preferred checks to prevent Hamas members from returning with them.\n\nIsrael has also indicated a willingness to withdraw forces from the so-called Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, according to a Channel 12 report on Saturday.\n\nThis report also said the terms being conveyed would provide for a subsequent phase of negotiations, in which an end to the war and the release of all further hostages would be discussed. It stressed that Israel would not have to commit to ending the war as a condition for the initial release of the 33 \"humanitarian\" hostages.\n\nHamas has since the November deal conditioned the release of any further hostages on Israel ending the war -- a demand Netanyahu has rejected as delusional.\n\nResponding to the Channel 12 report, a senior Israeli official told The Times of Israel on Saturday that \"Israel did not agree to an end to the war, to a withdrawal from the Strip, or to other demands that Hamas presented.\"\n\nThe war in Gaza erupted after Hamas's October 7 massacre, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, mostly civilians, many amid acts of brutality and sexual assault.\n\nIsrael estimates that 129 hostages remain in Gaza -- not all of them alive -- after 105 civilians were released from Hamas captivity during a weeklong truce in late November. Four hostages were released prior to that, and three were rescued by troops. The bodies of eight hostages have also been recovered and three hostages were mistakenly killed by the military. One more person has been listed as missing since October 7, and their fate is still unknown.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza claims that more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in the war, but the number cannot be independently verified as it is believed to include both Hamas terrorists and civilians, some of whom were killed as a consequence of the terror group's own rocket misfires.\n\nThe IDF says it has killed over 13,000 terrorists in Gaza, in addition to some 1,000 who were killed inside Israel on and immediately following October 7. The army also says 261 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the ground invasion.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tel_aviv@timesofisrael.com", "name": "Tel Aviv", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/04/F240427AVS105-e1714346826719.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9515473", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 452043927, "relevance": 8, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b5e"}

In September, before Hamas' Oct 7 attack on the Zionist entity, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Fox News that \"every day we get closer\" to a deal that could also bolster the Washington-Riyadh security partnership.\n\nHowever Prince Mohammed also said the Palestinian issue was \"very important\" for Riyadh, adding: \"We need to ease the life of the Palestinians.\" As fighting drags on and mediators struggle to lock in a truce, Saudi officials have reiterated their insistence on recognition of an independent Palestinian state. Princess Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, told the World Economic Forum in January that normalization would be impossible without an \"irrevocable\" pathway towards that state's creation.\n\nWhile it is no surprise Saudi Arabia would link ties with the Zionist entity to a resolution of the Zionist-Palestinian conflict, \"the price for normalization, especially on the Palestinian front, has certainly gone up,\" said Saudi analyst Aziz Alghashian. \"What can be said is that there needs to be something more tangible than theoretical,\" he said. \"In other words, more irreversible steps that are clear-cut, rather than just promises.\" The US State Department said that Blinken will discuss \"a pathway to an independent Palestinian state with security guarantees for (the Zionist entity)\", during talks in Riyadh on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nProgress disrupted\n\nSaudi Arabia, home to Islam's holiest sites, has never recognized the Zionist entity and did not join the 2020 US-brokered Abraham Accords that saw its Gulf neighbors Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco, establish formal ties with the Zionist entity. After Biden visited the Saudi city of Jeddah and fist-bumped the crown prince in 2022, his administration actively pursued a Saudi-Zionist deal that would build on the Abraham Accords, a foreign policy win for his predecessor Donald Trump.\n\nThe Saudis indicated they would want more than their Gulf peers got, bargaining hard for benefits like US security guarantees and assistance with a civilian nuclear program with uranium enrichment capacity. In the months that followed, Zionist and American officials issued bullish statements, while the Saudis said characteristically little. Their leverage, strengthened by their status as perceived leaders in the Muslim world, was never in doubt, said Elham Fakhro of the Chatham House think-tank.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia is aware of how badly the Biden administration wants a deal,\" Fakhro said. \"It is also aware that no other Arab country holds as much leverage as it does in lobbying for the Palestinians.\" Any momentum stalled abruptly with Hamas' Oct 7 attack. The Zionist entity's military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed more than 34,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Riyadh has consistently denounced Zionist forces' conduct in Gaza, accusing them of \"unchecked heinous war crimes\" just this week.\n\nA tall order\n\nEven without the Gaza war, sealing the Saudi-Zionist-US deal would be a tall order. \"The US will have to deliver on something and none of Saudi Arabia's conditions (or requests) are easy,\" Fakhro said. \"A defense pact would have to go through Congress and its approval there is far from certain.\" The rancor of election season in the US makes bipartisan deal-making even more difficult.\n\nIn any case, Netanyahu has repeatedly made clear his opposition to a Palestinian state, saying last month that Zionists rejected any attempt to \"ram\" it \"down our throats\". Given Saudi Arabia's position, that means an imminent breakthrough is unlikely. Long-time observers of Saudi diplomacy stress that should come as no surprise, despite the recent flurry of meetings and statements.\n\n\"From the beginning, Saudi Arabia was clear: Addressing the Palestinian-(Zionist) conflict in a manner that satisfies the Palestinians is a precondition for normalization with (the Zionist entity),\" said Saudi analyst Hesham Alghannam. \"Saudi Arabia is genuine in its condition that normalization is linked to the end of (the Zionist entity's) occupation of Palestinian land.\" - AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@kuwaittimes.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/04/28/102453.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9525081", "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 452043837, "relevance": 3, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b60"}

Six months on from the October 7 attacks, and with the Israeli scorched-earth response ongoing, it seemed timely to talk again to Loewenstein.\n\nHis thesis is that repressive states crave the battle-proven defence and surveillance technology Israel has deployed in Gaza.\n\n\"On the face of it, October 7 shows Israel's multi-billion-dollar intelligence military apparatus failed,\" he says. \"Israel was caught asleep at the wheel, the military disappeared for hours, the wall, the surveillance, all disappeared or was knocked out by Hamas very effectively.\n\n\"You would think that would diminish the image of Israel as a technical marvel. I would argue that in fact the opposite is happening.\"\n\nAgainst the background of entire suburbs being flattened by Israeli munitions, and seemingly every movement of Palestinians - would-be guerrillas and civilians alike - tracked by drones and sensors, personal direct text messages being monitored and the exploration and destruction of the Hamas tunnel network, Israeli defence companies have continued to exhibit at major arms shows and sell their technology.\n\n\"Israel has spent the past six months testing and showing huge amounts of new weapons: drones, quadcopters, surveillance tech and various other equipment in Gaza,\" says Loewenstein. \"It's too early to know exactly who's buying that equipment. We do know, in the past six months, for example, that Israel has had a large presence at arms fairs.\"\n\nStocks soar\n\nAlthough some technology failed on October 7, the incursion was mostly seen as a governmental and intelligence failure to which the answer might be more gear.\n\n\"The companies that have deployed the technology and other surveillance tech on the border that failed haven't taken a step back. If anything, they've simply, very clinically, said, 'Let's not look at the past. Let's focus on the fact that we are now the saviours of Israel.' In other words, 'You need us to protect Israel.\"'\n\nThe main publicly listed Israeli defence companies - IAI, Elbit, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems - have done record business since the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago and their stock prices have generally performed strongly this year.\n\nGlobal interest\n\nLife for Loewenstein has become more intense, as it has for many Jews in the diaspora, as well as in Israel. His book was somehow even more relevant and people worldwide wanted to know more about the failure of Israeli intelligence represented by the October 7 massacre and the implications of the devastating response.\n\n\"It's been very, very difficult. My book came out before October 7 and was doing pretty well. I got a lot of attention. Then October 7 happened and it's just exploded in ways that I could never have imagined. I wake up every day to interview requests from every corner of the globe.\"\n\nThe Sydney-based Loewenstein was already no stranger to attacks from fellow Jews and come-what-may backers of Israel. His journalism has been highly critical of the Israeli state and what he sees as decades of repression of Palestinians. His 2007 book, My Israel Question, was a searing indictment of Zionism and his rejection of it as a Jew.\n\nHe says Israel is profiting financially and in regional and global influence by demonstrating its military effectiveness and the depth of its monitoring capabilities. Far from failing on October 7 - a failing that may land on the military and not its equipment - Israel is exploiting the power of its weaponry deployed in Gaza.\n\nArab states that signed the so-called Abraham Accords (United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco) to normalise relations with Israel under the Trump administration have stuck with the relationship, as has Saudi Arabia, which had been close to establishing normal relations before October 7.\n\nIn each case, the authoritarian regimes may pay lip service to suppressed domestic protests against the Israeli destruction of Gaza, but in the end, Loewenstein believes, their political elites want access to Israel and its technology.\n\n\"None of them have cut ties and none of them will. I'm talking about the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Bahrainis, the list goes on. They know their people, in general, are very against what Israel is doing. And, to some extent, they have to show deference to that anger.\n\n\"But ultimately, I would argue that these nations are increasingly fearful of their own people for a range of reasons of which Palestine is one among many. They feel like they need the most sophisticated, repressive technology that they're buying from Israel to control their own people.\"\n\nLoewenstein expresses gloom about the outlook for Palestinians and for Israel, a country he sees as in the grip of a right wing that dehumanises Palestinians. Israel, he says, has no intention of bowing to what he sees as illusory and performative demands for a two-state solution - one which all who talk about it cynically know will never happen.\n\nIsrael radicalised\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be personally unpopular, but his policies and the right-wing elements in his coalition are popular, especially after October 7. Loewenstein says Israel is increasingly on a course that assumes Israeli ethnic superiority. Its uncompromising stance combines with extreme ideas of the end of days on the religious right to create sometimes odd bedfellows on the hard right of populist politics worldwide, especially given the history of the Holocaust.\n\n\"There is a major constituency in Israel for an ongoing war for endless occupation. Israeli society has been radicalised very strongly for years. October 7 has certainly made that even stronger.\"\n\nThe hideous bragging videos of atrocities and the dehumanisation of Palestinians posted by Israeli soldiers involve \"not just a few bad apples,\" he says. \"No. A massive amount of Israeli soldiers in cars are filming themselves on TikTok dehumanising Palestinians and this is not a handful of soldiers. This is ubiquitous.\"\n\nDuring our Zoom conversation, Loewenstein made a striking observation that put the scale of the destruction in Gaza into a historical context - one which should have been obvious but was somehow lost in the immediacy of the conflict: this war has displaced hundreds of thousands more people than the expulsion (or withdrawal, depending on who is telling the story) of Palestinians in 1948. The UN estimates 1.7 million people have been displaced in Gaza. In 1948, about 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled the region.\n\nKnown to Palestinians as the Nakba or Catastrophe, it is the origin of the occupation of the West Bank, the creation of an isolated Gaza Strip, and the status of Palestinians as refugees in camps created in that era, many of which are still there 75 years later. It's a scary calculus when you think how long the effects of the war against Hamas may last. \"What's happening now is on a scale far bigger than 1948. There's more displacement. And the killing was not even close to where we are now,\" he says of the more than 33,000 people reported killed in Gaza.\n\n\"We all know that this is going to take literally decades to rebuild.\"\n\nHe expects a generational explosion of anti-Israel and anti-Western sentiment across the Arab world.\n\nSlow dawning\n\nWith most domestic media in Israel reporting a strongly Israeli perspective on the conflict, and with social media tending to channel discussion into pre-existing camps, Loewenstein sees no sign that the Israeli public recognise the scale of the Gaza crisis or the likelihood they will live with its consequences for decades to come.\n\nNetanyahu may be the bogeyman, but he represents, or is in cahoots with, a large and robust portion of Israelis and certainly of Israeli hard-right politicians. He continues to face corruption charges, but he may well be replaced by someone just as hardline. Settlers continue to expand territory in the West Bank and even propose going to Gaza.\n\n\"It's fair to say that it's hard not to be even more despairing now than I would have been when we spoke [last July],\" Loewenstein says. \"Things are so grim. The only silver lining, in a way, is that there are growing numbers of young Jews who have been at the forefront of opposition to what's going on, mostly in the US, UK, Jewish Voice for Peace [for example]. They're a minority, but they're a growing minority.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "its@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "its", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tech@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "tech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/QR262UV6TZEEJCGA7CGIADA27E.jpg?auth=680a535794b5c19f590d567f5dca29d9a862b8e9a2a225abbac2cbeaf78ce3fd&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "eventUri": "eng-9515473", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 452043809, "relevance": 8, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b62"}

I have been called a bad person for advocating for the release of the hostages who have been in Hamas captivity for more than 200 days and have been told that \"Bring Them Home\" is hate speech. There is no limit to grief. I can grieve the countless innocent lives lost in Gaza and also want to bring home the Israeli hostages. This erosion of nuance is dangerous.\n\nAs a representative of the Jewish community on campus, I call upon interim Chancellor Lee Roberts to take action to protect Jewish students on campus.

And in the coming rematch, opinions about the first term of each man vying for a second four years in the White House now appear to work in Trump's favor, with most Americans saying that, looking back, Trump's term as president was a success, while a broad majority says Biden's has so far been a failure.\n\nTrump's support in the poll among registered voters holds steady at 49% in a head-to-head matchup against Biden, the same as in CNN's last national poll on the race in January, while Biden's stands at 43%, not significantly different from January's 45%.\n\nLooking back, 55% of all Americans now say they see Trump's presidency as a success, while 44% see it as a failure. In a January 2021 poll taken just before Trump left office and days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, 55% considered his time as president a failure.\n\nAssessing Biden's time in office so far, 61% say his presidency thus far has been a failure, while 39% say it's been a success. That's narrowly worse than the 57% who called the first year of his administration a failure in January 2022, with 41% calling it a success. Republicans now are more unified around the idea that Trump's presidency was a success than Democrats are that Biden's has been one. Overall, 92% of Republicans call Trump's time in office a success, while just 73% of Democrats say Biden's has been a success so far. Among independents, 51% say Trump's presidency was successful, while only 37% see Biden's as a success. There is some overlap in views of the two most recent presidents' achievements, with 14% of Americans saying they consider both are failures, while 8% say both are successes. About half of registered voters, 47%, consider Biden's presidency thus far to be a failure while saying Trump's was a success, while only 30% say Biden's has been successful and that Trump's was not. Public opinion of former presidents generally rises in retrospect, although no other modern president has attempted a similar return to power after an electoral loss.\n\nNegative views of Biden's work in office have held for much of his presidency. In the new poll, 60% disapprove of his handling of the job and 40% approve, about the same as it's been in CNN polling for more than a year. Even Biden's strongest issue approval ratings in the poll are also in negative territory, with 45% approving of his handling of health care policy and 44% approving his handling of student loan debt. And his worst issue approval rating - for his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza - yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and majority disapproval among Democrats (53%).", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2024-04-29/trump-maintains-lead-over-biden-in-2024-matchup-as-views-on-their-presidencies-diverge-1714347381-4231.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9516514", "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 452043692, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b65"}

The call lasted just under an hour, and they agreed the onus remains on Hamas to accept the latest offer in negotiations, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to comment publicly. There was no comment from Netanyahu's office.\n\nAlso Read | Indian-Origin Doctor Who Drove Tesla off Cliff With Family Inside Experienced 'Psychotic' Break, Fearing Sex Trafficking: Reports.\n\nA senior official from key intermediary Qatar, meanwhile, urged Israel and Hamas to show \"more commitment and more seriousness\" in negotiations.\n\nQatar, which hosts Hamas' headquarters in Doha, was instrumental along with the US and Egypt in helping negotiate a brief halt to the fighting in November that led to the release of dozens of hostages. But in a sign of frustration, Qatar this month said that it was reassessing its role.\n\nAn Israeli delegation is expected in Egypt in the coming days to discuss the latest proposals in negotiations, and senior Hamas official Basem Naim said in a message to The Associated Press that a delegation from the militant group will also head to Cairo. Egypt's state-owned Al Qahera News satellite television channel said that the delegation would arrive on Monday.\n\nThe comments by Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari in interviews with the liberal daily Haaretz and Israeli public broadcaster Kan were published and aired Saturday evening.\n\nAl-Ansari expressed disappointment with Hamas and Israel, saying each side has made decisions based on political interests and not with civilians' welfare in mind. He didn't reveal details on the talks other than to say they have \"effectively stopped,\" with \"both sides entrenched in their positions.\"\n\nAl-Ansari's remarks came after an Egyptian delegation discussed with Israeli officials a \"new vision\" for a prolonged cease-fire in Gaza, according to an Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss developments.\n\nThe Egyptian official said that Israeli officials are open to discussing establishing a permanent cease-fire in Gaza as part of the second phase of a deal. Israel has refused to end the war until it defeats Hamas.\n\nThe second phase would start after the release of civilian and sick hostages, and would include negotiating the release of soldiers, the official added. Senior Palestinian prisoners would be released and a reconstruction process launched.\n\nNegotiations earlier this month centered on a six-week cease-fire proposal and the release of 40 civilian and sick hostages held by Hamas in exchange for freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.\n\nA letter written by Biden and 17 other world leaders urged Hamas to release their citizens immediately. In recent days, Hamas has released new videos of three hostages, an apparent push for Israel to make concessions.\n\nThe growing pressure for Hamas and Israel to reach a cease-fire deal is also meant to avert an Israeli attack on Rafah, the city on the border with Egypt where more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million population is seeking shelter. Israel has massed dozens of tanks and armored vehicles. The planned incursion has raised global alarm.\n\n\"Only a small strike is all it takes to force everyone to leave Palestine,\" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asserted to the opening session of the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia, adding that he believed an invasion would happen within days.\n\nBut White House national security spokesman John Kirby told ABC that Israel \"assured us they won't go into Rafah until we've had a chance to really share our perspectives and concerns with them. So, we'll see where that goes.\"\n\nThe Israeli troop buildup may also be a pressure tactic on Hamas in talks. Israel sees Rafah as Hamas' last major stronghold. It vows to destroy the group's military and governing capabilities.\n\nAid groups have warned that an invasion of Rafah would worsen the already desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, where hunger is widespread. About 400 tons of aid arrived Sunday at the Israeli port of Ashdod -- the largest shipment yet by sea via Cyprus -- according to the UAE.\n\nAlso on Sunday, World Central Kitchen said it would resume operations in Gaza on Monday, ending a four-week suspension after Israeli military drones killed seven of its aid workers. The organization has 276 trucks ready to enter through the Rafah crossing and will also send trucks into Gaza from Jordan, a statement said. It's also examining if the Ashdod port can be used to offload supplies.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas' attack on Oct. 7 into southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities, who say another 250 people were taken hostage. Hamas and other groups are holding about 130 people, including the remains of about 30, Israeli authorities say.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory assault on Hamas has killed more than 34,000 people, most of them women and children, according to health authorities in Gaza, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their tally.\n\nThe Israeli military blames Hamas for civilian casualties, accusing it of embedding in residential and public areas. It says it has killed at least 12,000 militants, without providing evidence.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Latestly-World-News-784x441.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9515473", "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 452043574, "relevance": 7, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b68"}

Biden tries humor on the campaign trail\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is out to win some votes by scoring some laughs at the expense of Donald Trump. Biden is using mockery with the goal of getting under Trump's skin and reminding the country of Trump's blunders. Like a comic honing his routine, the Democratic president has been testing and expanding his jokes over the past few weeks. It started with jabs about his Republican opponent's financial problems, and now Biden regularly jeers Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and much more. The jokes are the latest attempt to crack the code on how to clap back at Trump, whose own schtick has redrawn the boundaries of what's acceptable in modern politics.\n\nDonald Trump is running against Joe Biden. But he keeps bringing up another Democrat: Jimmy Carter\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Donald Trump is running against Joe Biden, but Trump keeps bringing up another Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Trump likes to cite the 99-year-old Carter as a measuring stick to belittle Biden. Trump calls Carter a happy man because, according to Trump, Biden's performance in office makes Carter's presidency look good in comparison. It was once common for Republicans to mock Carter, who lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan in 1980 amid inflation, energy shortages and the Iran hostage crisis. Trump's implication is that Biden's economy makes Carter's look better. Federal figures show today's economy is stronger and more stable than in the late 1970s. And over the years, Carter's overall presidency has gotten stronger assessments from historians.\n\nTornadoes kill 4 in Oklahoma, leaving trail of destruction and thousands without power\n\nSULPHUR, Okla. (AP) -- Tornadoes have killed four people in Oklahoma and left thousands without power. The tornadoes began late Saturday night and left at least 100 people injured around Oklahoma. One tornado destroyed several downtown buildings in Sulphur, Oklahoma, flipping over cars and shearing rooftops off houses across a 15-block radius. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt toured the destruction on Sunday and said every business in the town of Sulphur appeared to have been destroyed. Oklahoma's severe weather adds to the dozens of reported tornadoes that have wreaked havoc in the nation's midsection since Friday. Authorities said Sunday that one person also died in Iowa because of the storms.\n\nPutin likely didn't order death of Russian opposition leader Navalny, US official says\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely didn't order the death of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny in February. An official says the U.S. intelligence community has found \"no smoking gun\" that Putin was aware of the timing of Navalny's death or directly ordered it. The official says it's believed Putin was ultimately responsible for the death of Navalny, who endured brutal conditions during his confinement. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. Navalny was Russia's best-known opposition politician and died while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he called politically motivated. A month later, Putin won reelection.\n\nPassage of harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law in Iraq draws diplomatic backlash\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) -- Human rights groups and diplomat have criticized a law that was quietly passed by the Iraqi parliament over the weekend that would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people. Although homosexuality is taboo in the largely conservative Iraqi society and political leaders have periodically launched anti-LGBTQ campaigns, Iraq did not previously have a law that explicitly criminalized it. The law passed Saturday with little notice as an amendment to the country's existing anti-prostitution law, imposes a sentence of 10 to 15 years for same-sex relations and a prison term of one to three years for people who undergo or perform gender-transition surgeries and for \"intentional practice of effeminacy.\"\n\nAfrican farmers look to the past and the future to address climate change\n\nHARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- From ancient fertilizer methods in Zimbabwe to new greenhouse technology in Somalia, farmers across the heavily agriculture-reliant African continent are looking both to the past and future to respond to climate change. Africa has the world's youngest population. It is seeing the worst effects of a warming planet while contributing the least to the problem. Farmers are scrambling to make sure the booming population is fed. Some are turning to traditional foods that had been long dismissed as weeds or neglected in favor of imports. Others embrace new planting methods and varieties. One new bean's side benefit is less flatulence.\n\nObstacles remain as women seek more leadership roles in America's Black Church\n\nThroughout its long history, the Black Church in America has - for the most part - been a patriarchal institution, with men making up the vast majority of its ranks of clergy. These days, increasing numbers of Black women are attending seminary, and some women are carving out high-profile leadership roles. The African Methodist Episcopal Church says it has more than 1,000 female pastors. But obstacles remain. The founder of a group called Women of Color in Ministry estimates that less than one in 10 Black Protestant congregations are led by a woman.\n\nCandace Parker, a 3-time WNBA champion and 2-time Olympic gold medalist, announces retirement\n\nThree-time WNBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Candace Parker has announced she's retiring after 16 seasons.

Parker became the first player in WNBA history to be named Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in the same season in 2008.

In 2024, nothing has changed.\n\nIn the award-winning Sea of Poppies, Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh immortalised the journey of 19th century indentured labour migrants- called \"girmitiyas\"-aboard a ship to Mauritius during the heyday of British colonialism.\n\nIt's 2024. Another group of migrant workers trudges through New Delhi international airport carrying cheap plastic suitcases, wearing clothing bought off roadside flea markets.\n\nThey are the new age \"girmitiyas\" in search of a promised El Dorado.\n\nMore than 60 Indian construction workers left for Israel in early April amid mounting concerns for their safety and rising opposition from trade unions in India, but to no avail.\n\nThe low cost Azerbaijan Airways flight, which took these worker armies to the outskirts of Tel Aviv, was jam-packed. Some workers were shunted off to an Ethiopian Airways flight which took an even more circuitous route to the promised land.\n\nThese workers travelled despite their government having warned Indians that Israel is now a war zone and it's best to avoid any travel there.\n\nIn March, the Indian government advised Indians in Israel to move to safer locations following the killing of migrant worker Pat Nibin Maxwell.\n\nBut India's worker-migrants have kept marching.\n\nWhen Israel's war on Palestine erupted last October, Israel cancelled the permits of Palestinian workers, and sought to replace them with as many as 100,000 migrant workers from countries like India, continuing an agreement between the two governments.\n\nWhile Israel's recruitment of workers in a conflict zone is worrying, far worse is India's willingness to send its workers into the line of fire.\n\nMore than 18,000 Indians, mostly care workers, already work in Israel. Another 6,000 were to join them in April. Some reports indicate that the travel plans for the remaining are on hold.\n\nThe motivations of the Indian government - which actively facilitated the recruitment of Indian workers to Israel under its National Skill Development Corporation - come into question.\n\nThe answer can be found in India's strained relationship with its migrant workers - both under British colonialism and after independence.\n\nAfter the first steps were taken toward the abolition of slavery in the 19th century, Britain recruited more than 1 million workers from colonial India to work in sugar, coffee, rubber, tea and cotton plantations, in laying railway tracks and in mining, in colonies across the globe, from the Caribbean, to the Pacific as well as in India itself.\n\nThe indentured workers entered a contract for three to five years. They would be advanced a certain amount of money, and at the end entitled to free passage home.\n\nAcross the great Gangetic plains, thousands of agricultural workers in economic distress joined the sea voyages, part of the system that continued until 1917. To the government, they came to be known as \"coolies\".\n\nWhile the workers were supposed to be subjects of the British Indian government, in reality plantation lobbies and commercial interests had considerable say in the system. From the moment they signed up for indentureship, the workers were subjected to multiple authorities, including the labour recruiter, the agent, the ship's captain and eventually the plantation owner.\n\nPlantation work and other work was often risky and backbreaking. The presence of single women was considered 'immoral', leading to calls by Indian nationalists to demand an abolition of the system.\n\nSome commentators have termed indentureship a \"new system of slavery\", while others argue that indentureship was better than the life of poverty and hunger they left behind in debt-ridden United Provinces or modern day Bihar.\n\nBetween 1914 and 1918, more than 500,000 Indian signed up as non-combatants in World War One, working in the medical, ordnance and transport services, as grass cutters, blacksmiths, veterinary personnel and in various other jobs that need to be done in and around a regiment.\n\nThese included porters recruited from prisons as well as young men signing up to the Indian Porter Corps and Indian Labour Corps from United Provinces, Bihar, Assam, Bengal, Orissa, Burma and the North Western Frontier Province-much of it the same catchment area which supplied the indentured workers.\n\nMore than 17,000 Indian non-combatants were killed in the World War One. The wounded were racially segregated for treatment, which was not up to the standard of care for the British.\n\nMuch like indentured workers who were denied their rights as sovereign British-Indian subjects, or the workers shipped out during the World War One, the migrant workers in Israel will be navigating work amidst an ongoing war and a newly developing crisis with Iran, with no safety net in place.\n\nAs for the modern-day labourers, their willingness to sign up to work in a conflict zone such as Israel is testimony to their acute financial distress.\n\nA recent International Labour Organization report shows that total unemployed youth in India almost doubled from 35.2 percent in 2000 to 65.7 percent in 2022.\n\nThe COVID lockdown of 2020 and the spectacular distress of migrant workers, employed in various unorganised sectors ranging from agriculture to construction, showed the precarious nature of their employment and their flimsy incomes.\n\nConstruction workers selected for jobs in Israel were quoted in the media as saying that despite the obvious dangers of their job, the payment was too lucrative to turn down. For many, it was almost ten times what they make in a month. For others, devoid of any safety nets, their existing jobs also leave them vulnerable.\n\nTwo Indian workers recruited under false pretences but made to work with the Russian military were killed in the past two months, while reportedly 100 like them continue to work in Russia, having migrated through an agent.\n\nAlthough not in a conflict zone, various Gulf countries, including Qatar, have been criticised for large numbers of migrant worker deaths - especially in the lead up to the FIFA World Cup in 2022.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2022, 2,400 Indian nationals were reported to have died in Qatar, falling victim to harsh working conditions and unfavourable laws, including the now-scrapped Kafala system.\n\nFamilies claim the only time the Indian government steps in to help migrant workers and their families is when their bodies have to be returned home. The case of Pat Nibin Maxwell was no different.\n\nMaxwell travelled to work in Israel through a recruitment agency, unlike the ones now being recruited through direct government intervention in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Indian Embassy's first intervention in his life was in his death, as it was for Hemil Mangukiya and Mohammed Asfan in Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, as their families grieve, five other Indian states are keen on joining the recruitment process.\n\nPostcolonial India does not seem any better than its colonial avatar in caring for its migrant workers.

Besides Jack, who was Trump's political director during his administration and worked for then-U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they included former state senators Mike Crane and Mike Dugan, former state Rep. Philip Singleton and party activist Jim Bennett.\n\nThey're seeking to replace Republican U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson, who is stepping down. The district hugs the Alabama border from Carrollton to Columbus and swings east into the Atlanta suburbs of Newnan and Peachtree City.\n\nJack repeatedly referenced his work in the Trump administration, promising that in Congress he would continue that work.\n\n\"To sell myself, I think that I will look at the record of accomplishment and success that we had and we delivered in that administration,\" Jack said.\n\nOthers largely passed on the chance to attack Jack, although Crane suggested that McCarthy is the one trying to anoint Jack, asking voters who should choose their representative.\n\n\"Do you want to take responsibility for that vote or do you want to let Washington, D.C., insiders do what they've done for the last several cycles, and that is choose the next representative for the 3rd District?\" Crane asked.\n\nBut attacks on Jack, the fundraising leader in the race, were mostly muted. Crane, Bennett and Singleton staked out more conservative positions, with each saying they would join the Freedom Caucus if elected.\n\nSingleton was often at odds with GOP leadership during his time in the state House, attacking then-Speaker David Ralston's leadership, with top Republicans then drawing Singleton into a majority Democratic district. Singleton, though, said he's \"not an oppositional guy.\"\n\n\"You go and you fight for the principles that you believe in, you stand for,\" Singleton said. \"I'm not someone that fights against people. I fight for good policy.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether human embryos should have the same rights as people, Jack echoed Trump's position that restrictions on reprodutive rights should be left to the states. Dugan noted he voted for Georgia's current abortion restrictions, which ban abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected. That's typically after about six weeks, often before a woman knows she is pregnant.\n\nBut Dugan said restriction of in vitro fertilization was \"a deeper question,\" not saying clearly how he would vote.\n\nThe other three, though, voiced no doubts about implementing a legal standard that could lead to a total ban on abortion in Georgia and a ban on in vitro fertilization as currently practiced.\n\n\"I'm against recreational abortion,\" Bennett said. \"I believe that life does exist from the moment of conception. There's no wiggle room for me.\"\n\nAll of the candidates, in a show of hands, said they believed Trump was the rightful winner of Georgia's 16 electoral votes in 2020, despite no reliable evidence to contradict Democrat Joe Biden's win. Several said they believed Republican-backed changes to Georgia's election laws since then made them more at ease, but Bennett attacked the continued use of Dominion ballot marking devices, echoing a common belief among Republican activists that all voting machines should be distrusted.\n\nAll of the candidates voiced support for more restrictions on immigration, with several including Jack saying they support mass deportations of people who have entered the country illegally. Jack said he would have voted against the recent foreign aid package to Ukraine, Israel and others until he was satisfied on border security.\n\nDugan said he believed Republicans were right to reject a proposed bill on border security that the Biden administration had backed.\n\n\"I don't think anybody trusted Joe Biden to secure our southern border,\" Dugan said.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/preview-2408.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520974", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 452044602, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b6e"}

But the \"humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire,\" the aid group's chief operating officer, Erin Gore, said in a statement.\n\n\"We are restarting our operation with the same energy, dignity and focus on feeding as many people as possible,\" she said.\n\nThe aid group said it had distributed more than 43 million meals in Gaza so far and that it had trucks carrying the equivalent of nearly 8 million meals waiting to enter the enclave through the Rafah crossing in the south. World Central Kitchen said it was also planning to send trucks to Gaza through Jordan and that it would open a kitchen in Muwasi, a small seaside village that the Israeli military designated as a \"humanitarian zone\" safe for civilians, though attacks there have continued.\n\nSix of the seven workers killed on April 1 were from Western nations -- three from Britain, one from Australia, one from Poland, and one with dual citizenship of the U.S. and Canada. The seventh was Palestinian. They were killed in back-to-back Israeli drone strikes on their vehicles as they traveled toward Rafah after unloading food aid that had arrived by sea.\n\nThe attack prompted the World Central Kitchen to immediately suspend its operations in Gaza and elicited outrage from some of Israel's closest allies.\n\nThe World Central Kitchen convoy's movements had been coordinated in advance with the Israeli military, but some officers had not reviewed the coordination documentation detailing which cars were part of the convoy, the military said.\n\nAbout 200 aid workers, most of them Palestinians, were killed in Gaza between Oct. 7 and the attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy, according to the United Nations. A New York Times visual investigation showed that, well before the World Central Kitchen attack, six aid groups in Gaza had come under Israeli fire despite sharing their locations with the Israeli military.\n\nThe episode forced World Central Kitchen to decide between ending its efforts in Gaza or continuing, \"knowing that aid, aid workers and civilians are being intimidated and killed,\" Gore said in the statement.\n\n\"Ultimately, we decided that we must keep feeding, continuing our mission of showing up to provide food to people during the toughest of times,\" she said.\n\nAt a memorial in Washington for the World Central Kitchen workers Thursday, the group's founder, celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, said that there were \"many unanswered questions about what happened and why\" and that the aid group was still demanding an independent investigation into the Israeli military's actions.\n\nThe seven aid workers had \"risked everything to feed people they did not know and will never meet,\" Andr\u00e9s said. \"They were the best of humanity.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Advertiser-thumbnail-image.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520627", "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 452044592, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b6f"}

But, really, it came down to only two men: Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nWashington's annual mashup of political humor and earnest paeans to the free press is typically a good-natured collection of one-liners and affectionate jabs at friends and enemies alike. But it was the leading 2024 presidential contenders who loomed largest - one in the Washington Hilton hotel ballroom, the other who definitely, positively, probably was not watching from Mar-a-Lago. Unless, of course, he was.\n\n\"The 2024 election is in full swing and, yes, age is an issue,\" President Biden told the black-tie crowd. \"I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.\"\n\n\"Can we just acknowledge how refreshing it is,\" comedian Colin Jost later added, \"to see a president of the United States at an event that doesn't begin with a bailiff saying, 'All rise!'\"\n\nFor most of the evening, Trump ignored the dinner and posted instead about presidential immunity and political witch hunts. Shortly after 1 a.m., he finally chimed in on Truth Social: \"The White House Correspondents' Dinner was really bad. Colin Jost BOMBED, and Crooked Joe was an absolute disaster! Doesn't get much worse than this!\"\n\nSo, basically, another day on the campaign trail.\n\nBut for the denizens of Washington's political media, it was a special occasion. The correspondents' dinner is ostensibly a playful celebration of the codependent relationship between Washington politicians and reporters who spend the rest of the year covering them and deadly serious issues: Trump's legal trials, looming uncertainty about what will happen in November (and beyond), the Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIt proved hard to put all that aside for the night. Especially Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protesters surrounded the entrance outside of the hotel, shouting chants such as, \"Western media, you can't hide! We charge you with genocide!\" and confronting guests arriving to the dinner in their tuxedos and gowns. Some attendees were followed by tight circles of protesters yelling \"Shame!\" inches from their faces until they could get behind police.\n\n\"I came in through a different entrance, so I didn't hear exactly what they are chanting,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), running up an escalator to the lobby. \"But there are tens of thousands of people being blown to bits in Gaza, so I understand why they are protesting. I stand with the movement - depending on what they are saying.\"\n\nThe experience of walking the gantlet of activists seemed to have left a lot of people somewhat stunned. But inside the ballroom, it was all smiles and hugs and back slaps.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) charmed everyone, wearing a big smile and a \"FREE EVAN\" pin in honor of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) gave a report on his own encounter with the protesters outside: \"I asked them about what was happening in Sudan. And they yelled louder. And then I asked them about the concentration camps full of Uyghurs. And they yelled louder. And then I went inside.\" Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for New York Magazine, got off a presidential zinger of her own: \"I can't hear a thing in here - I feel like Biden.\"\n\nBiden's own zingers were directed almost entirely at his opponent.\n\n\"Trump's so desperate, he started reading those Bibles he's selling,\" the president said. \"Then he got to the First Commandment: 'You shall have no other gods before me.' That's when he put it down and said, 'This book's not for me.'\"\n\nBut the president soon dispensed with the yuks and pivoted to what felt like a stump speech about the clear and present danger posed by Trump and his movement. He called on the journalists in the room to report \"truth over lies.\" He implored them to move past the election horse race stories and focus on American democracy. \"The stakes couldn't be higher,\" he said. No punchline.\n\nOfficially, the evening is nonpartisan, and the only toast of the night goes to the sitting president, regardless of party affiliation. Unofficially, the dinner has always been perceived as a hotbed of Washington elites who lean left, regardless of media affiliation.\n\nTrump, who was famously roasted by President Barack Obama at the 2011 dinner, never attended the event as president. His relentless criticism of the mainstream media caused many news organizations to threaten a boycott of the dinner in 2017; Trump announced that he would not attend. He skipped two following years and even counterprogrammed with a MAGA rally instead. The party soldiered on, reinforcing a commitment to the role of a free press in a democracy, and many breathed a not-so-discreet sigh of relief when the crowd resumed in 2022 after the worst of the pandemic with Biden carrying the torch.\n\nThe only Trump spotted at this year's festivities was daughter-in-law Lara Trump, recently crowned co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Her father-in-law wasn't in the building, but comic impressionist Matt Friend emerged from the crowd with a Trump impersonation - as well as sendups of Bernie Sanders, Mitch McConnell and Obama. He also made the first (and, surprisingly, only) dead-dog joke of the night.\n\n\"I am killing this dinner harder than Kristi Noem kills the puppies,\" Friend said in his Trump voice, riffing off the news that the Republican governor of South Dakota, in a forthcoming book, admits to shooting her 14-month-old dog because she was \"untrainable\" and aggressive.\n\nLet's face it: It's a tough room for a comedian. Jost, co-anchor of \"Saturday Night Live's\" \"Weekend Update,\" sat at the head table next to the president and nearby first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and WHCA President Kelly O'Donnell, senior White House correspondent for NBC News. His speech came after Biden's and felt like one of his SNL bits: Some jokes got laughs, others landed awkwardly.\n\nThere were a few jabs at Biden, a \"decent\" man who Jost said reminds him of his beloved grandfather, a Staten Island firefighter. There were also some uneven one-liners about the press, but the press never laughs at itself, so it's hard to know whether they were good or bad jokes.\n\nJost took several swipes at the former president, too: \"I love that Trump's two attacks on Biden are that he's a senile old man and a criminal mastermind. I think you've got to pick one. Personally, I don't know any criminal masterminds who bike to get ice cream.\" On the courtroom drawings that have emerged from the trials: \"Every sketch of Trump looks like the Grinch had sex with the Lorax.\"\n\nJost brought the evening's most glamorous celebrity: movie star Scarlett Johansson, whom he married in 2020. What started a century ago as an annual gathering of reporters and their subjects morphed into the \"Nerd Prom\" about 35 years ago - a red carpet extravaganza where news organizations battle to host administration officials, Hollywood A-listers, corporate heavyweights and anyone else basking in their 15 minutes of fame. Within the throngs are a few people who actually work as White House correspondents.\n\nWith some exceptions, this year's guest list fell solidly into B-list territory: Jon Hamm, Chris Pine, Keri Russell, Molly Ringwald, Rosario Dawson, Jon Cryer, Caitlyn Jenner, Billy Porter, Lorne Michaels.\n\nBefore the speeches, the WHCA handed out its awards for excellence. The award for overall excellence went to Barak Ravid of Axios, Peter Baker of the New York Times received the print award for deadline reporting, and Tamara Keith of NPR received the broadcast award in the same category - all singled out for stories following Hamas's Oct. 7 attack in Israel. Doug Mills of the Times got the award for visual journalism for a striking photo of Biden, and the award for courage and accountability went to The Washington Post for coverage on the impact of assault rifles and mass shootings.\n\nThe evening ended, as it always does: with an impassioned defense of democracy and the critical role of the press in preserving it.\n\nJost had his own thoughts about the media. \"Your words speak truth to power. Your words bring light to the darkness.\" Then he paused and grinned, \"And most importantly, your words train the AI programs that will soon replace you.\"\n\nBiden ended with a toast of his own: \"To a free press. To an informed citizenry. To an America where freedom and democracy endure. God bless America.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/28/PDTN/73494894007-correspondents-j-3-pv-7-iolqtjwhe-6-wb-6-pgwqwow-4.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3497,1968,x0,y304&format=pjpg&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-9519637", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 452044548, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b71"}

Hunger has been a particular problem in the northern Gaza Strip as the destruction of roads and infrastructure has isolated areas around Gaza City.Analysis from the group Integrated Food Security Phase Classification projected that half of people in the Gaza Strip would face \"catastrophic\" levels of malnutrition by mid-July if trends continued. All 2.2 million people in the enclave would be unable to fully meet nutritional needs necessary to maintain good health.Gore added that aid workers are still under threat in Gaza, likely contributing to the group's decision to fully delegate its work to local Palestinians for now.The group is still calling for \"an impartial and international investigation into the IDF attack\" in which Israeli drones targeted three separate vehicles in the organization's aid convoy, continuously targeting survivors of the first two strikes as they scrambled to flee the attack.The incident generated outrage in the West and among liberal US lawmakers in particular as WCK's founder, celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, is a personal friend of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other high-profile Democratic Party leaders. The incident prompted former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, among 40 other top Democrats, to sign onto a letter urging Biden to halt weapons transfers to Israel without human rights guarantees.Some observers claimed a double standard in media coverage of the attack, which killed six white foreign aid workers and their Palestinian driver. On the day of the Israeli drone strike against the organization the death toll among Gazans stood at an estimated 32,845.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_miles@sputnikglobe.com", "name": "John Miles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1118167268.jpg?11181670931714348398", "eventUri": "eng-9520627", "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 452044469, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b73"}

Doctors and ambulance crews evacuated patients from a Kyiv children's hospital on Friday after a video circulated online saying Russia planned to attack it. Francisco Seco/Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's troops have been forced to make a tactical retreat from three villages in the embattled east, the country's army chief said Sunday, warning of a worsening battlefield situation as Ukrainian forces wait for much-needed arms from a huge U.S. aid package to reach combat zones.\n\nCol. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi reported that Russian forces continue to attack \"along the entire front line\" of more than 620 miles, with pitched battles raging west of Avdiivka, the eastern city they took in February after a grueling, monthslong fight.\n\n\"The most difficult situation is in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions, where fierce battles continue,\" Syrskyi's said in an update posted to the Telegram messaging app, referencing two Ukrainian-held cities in the war-torn Donetsk region, once a hub of industry.\n\n\"The enemy has engaged up to four brigades in these directions, is trying to develop an offensive west of Avdiivka and Marinka, making its way to Pokrovsk and Kurakhove,\" Syrskyi added. \"Units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, preserving the lives and health of our defenders, moved to new frontiers west of Berdychi, Semenivka and Novomykhailivka.\"\n\nTwo of these front-line villages lie less than 31 miles east of Pokrovsk, while the third is located just over 19 miles by road from Kurakhove.\n\nA Washington-based think tank predicted late Saturday that Russian forces \"will likely make significant tactical gains in thec coming weeks,\" as acute ammunition shortages continue to hobble Ukraine's defense efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its latest operational assessment, the Institute for the Study of War said that Moscow's forces have opportunities to push forward around Avdiivka, and also threaten nearby Chasiv Yar. Its capture would give Russia control of a hilltop from which it can attack other key cities forming the backbone of Ukraine's eastern defenses.\n\nDespite this, the think tank assessed that neither of these efforts by Moscow are likely to cause Kyiv's defensive lines to collapse \"in the near term.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday confirmed that Moscow's troops had taken a village about 9 miles north of Avdiivka, days after the war institute reported on its likely capture early on Thursday. That day's assessment described Moscow's gains as \"relatively quick but still relatively marginal,\" adding that Russian troops had advanced by no more than 5 kilometers (3 miles) over the previous week.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden promised on Wednesday that U.S. weapons shipments would begin making their way into Ukraine within hours, as he signed into law a $95 billion measure -- $61 billion of which was allocated for Ukraine -- that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hot spots. The announcement marked an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, Russian drones struck the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Mykolaiv early Sunday, setting a hotel ablaze and damaging infrastructure, according to local officials.\n\nVitaliy Kim, the governor of Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv province, said that the drones \"seriously damaged\" a hotel in its namesake capital, sparking a fire that was later extinguished. Kim also reported that the strike damaged heat-generating infrastructure in the city. He added that there were no casualties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian state agency RIA reported that the strike on Mykolaiv targeted a shipyard where naval drones are assembled, as well as a hotel housing \"English-speaking mercenaries\" who have fought for Kyiv. The RIA report cited Sergei Lebedev, described as a coordinator of local pro-Moscow guerrillas. His comments couldn't be independently verified.\n\nAlso on Sunday morning, the Russian Defense Ministry said that 17 Ukrainian drones were downed overnight over four regions in the country's southwest. Three drones were intercepted near an oil depot in Lyudinovo, an industrial town about 230 kilometers (143 miles) north of the Ukrainian border, Gov. Vladislav Shapsha said.\n\nOne of the Ukrainian drones damaged communications infrastructure in Russia's southern Belgorod province, which borders Ukraine, Gov. Vyachaslav Gladkov said later on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry claimed Sunday that its forces had destroyed ammunition depots and military equipment housed at three airports across Ukraine, including assault drones stored at Kamyanka Airfield in the country's east. The ministry's online update said the attacks took place over the last 24 hours. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.\n\nRussian shelling on Saturday and overnight wounded at least seven civilians across Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. A 36-year-old woman was pulled alive from the rubble after Russian shells on Sunday morning destroyed her home in the northeastern Kharkiv region, the local administration reported. Her 52-year-old neighbor was also rushed to a hospital with a stomach wound, the administration said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nHow an inclusive gym brand became a battlefield over LGBTQ rights filed under: russia, ukraine Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/04/Russia_Ukraine_War_99327_94345a-1714348235.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9519715", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 452044467, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b74"}

The rally was co-sponsored by the United Jewish Coalition in partnership with the Israel American Council and several related organizations.\n\nMembers of the Harriet Tubman Center for Social Justice scheduled a 9:30 a.m. demonstration to support students' right to protest, in response to a request from pro-Palestine protesters at the campus.\n\n\"This morning, a group of demonstrators breached a barrier that the university had established separating two groups of protestors on our campus, resulting in physical altercations,\" Mary Osako, vice chancellor of UCLA Strategic Communications, said in a statement provided to City News Service. \"UCLA has a long history of being a place of peaceful protest, and we are heartbroken about the violence that broke out.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Bruin, members of both groups were facing off on the lawn between Haines Hall and Kaplan Hall Sunday morning.\n\n\"Fights have broken out between protesters supporting Israel and those supporting Palestine in Dickson Plaza,\" the newspaper reported at 10:57 a.m.\n\nAmong the speakers at the pro-Israel rally was Elan Carr, CEO of the Israeli American Council.\n\n\"We will take back our campuses, from Columbia to UCLA and everywhere in between,\" he told the crowd, according to the Daily Bruin.\n\nNo arrests were reported as of midday Sunday.\n\n\"My team and I are closely tracking the protests at UCLA today, and are in close communication with UCLA leadership and City officials to ensure the safety and wellbeing of everyone on campus,\" City Councilwoman Katy Yaroslavsky posted on X.\n\nLater in the afternoon, a phalanx of campus police entered the area to keep the groups apart. The Daily Bruin reported that the pro-Israel group had largely dispersed.\n\n\"Pro-Palestine protesters walked through campus and have now stopped between Pauley Pavilion and the Central Ticket Office,\" the campus newspaper posted at 3:12 p.m. \"Some have formed a human wall by the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center to stop counter-protesters who followed the crowd.\"\n\nA few minutes later, the newspaper reported that the pro-Palestinian demonstrators also began to disperse.\n\nOvernight, the pro-Palestine protesters had expanded their campus encampment outside to stretch from the top of the Janss Steps to the east end of Royce Hall.\n\nThe growing number of pro-Palestine protesters has been met with an equally fervent group of counter-protesters who played loud music near the encampment and shouted chants about Palestine preceded by an obscenity, according to the Daily Bruin.\n\nOne counter-protester stomped on a Palestinian flag at the encampment while another ripped posters off the exterior of the encampment, the Daily Bruin reported.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, groups supporting the counter-protesters had raised $64,478 on GoFundMe to support Bruins for Israel, more the twice the initial $26,000 goal.\n\nThe makeshift cluster of more than 50 camping tents for the pro-Palestine protesters began forming early Thursday and continued to grow over the weekend.\n\nOrganizers of UCLA's Palestine Solidarity Encampment, similar to their counterparts at USC, issued a list of demands calling for divestment of all University of California and UCLA Foundation funds from companies tied to Israel, along with a demand that the university call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and an academic boycott by UC against Israeli universities, including a suspension of study-abroad programs.\n\nIt was unclear whether all of the participants were UCLA students.\n\nThe University of California issued a statement Friday noting that the university has \"consistently opposed calls for boycott against and divestment from Israel.

In a January 2021 poll taken just before Trump left office and days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, 55% considered his time as president a failure.\n\n61% say Biden's presidency thus far has been a failure, while 39% say it's been a success. That's narrowly worse than the 57% who called the first year of his administration a failure in January 2022, with 41% calling it a success.\n\nRepublicans now are more unified around the idea that Trump's presidency was a success than Democrats are that Biden's has been one. Overall, 92% of Republicans call Trump's time in office a success, while just 73% of Democrats say Biden's has been a success so far. Among independents, 51% say Trump's presidency was successful, while only 37% see Biden's as a success.\n\n45% approve of Biden's handling of health care policy and 44% approve of his handling of student loan debt.\n\nBiden's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and a majority disapproval among Democrats (53%).\n\nA broad majority of all Americans, 70%, say economic conditions in the US are poor, with many, particularly Republicans, who feel that way saying their views would be more affected by a political shift than a change in the economy itself.\n\nAmong all voters, when independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are included in the matchup, Trump holds 42% to Biden's 33%, with Kennedy at 16%, West at 4% and Stein at 3%.

The BBC Arabic reporter shares the harrowing moments he faced covering a war that pushed him to his limits.\n\nWarning: This report contains descriptions and images some readers may find distressing\n\nOne of the worst moments of the past six months was the night we all slept on the street. I looked at the faces of my wife and children, huddled in the bitter cold in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and felt helpless.\n\nMy 19-year-old twins, Zakia and Batoul, lay on the pavement alongside my daughter, Yumna, who is 14, my son Mohamed, who is eight and my youngest girl, Razan, aged five, with their mother, Zaynab.\n\nAs we tried to rest outside the Palestinian Red Crescent Society's headquarters, the sounds of shelling echoed through the night and drones buzzed overhead.\n\nWe had managed to find an apartment to rent, but the landlord had called earlier that day, saying the Israeli military had warned him the building would be bombed. I was working at the time, but my family grabbed their bags and fled.\n\nWe met up at the Red Crescent headquarters, which was already overflowing with displaced people.\n\nMy brother and I sat on cardboard boxes all night, discussing what we should do.\n\nWe had fled our homes in the town of Jabalia a few days earlier, on 13 October, leaving most of our possessions behind, after the Israeli military told everyone in northern Gaza to move south for safety.\n\nAnd now we had just escaped being bombed in the area we had been told to move to. It was hard to think straight. I felt angry, humiliated and terrible that I could not provide any protection for my family.\n\nEventually, my family moved to an apartment in Nuseirat in central Gaza, while I stayed with the BBC team in a tent at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. I visited every few days.\n\nCommunication was difficult, with internet and phone signals sometimes cut. Once I did not hear from my family for four or five days.\n\nIn Khan Younis, the BBC team - about seven of us - lived on one meal a day. Even when there was food, sometimes we did not eat it because there was hardly anywhere to go to the toilet.\n\nDuring this time my friend, Al Jazeera bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh, suffered a terrible loss.\n\nThe house his family had been staying in was hit in an Israeli air strike. His wife, teenage son, seven-year-old daughter and one-year-old grandson were killed.\n\nThe Israeli military says it takes \"feasible precautions\" to reduce civilian casualties, and in this case had \"targeted Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area\".\n\nReporting Gaza: My War\n\nIn Gaza, Palestinian journalists document the war as they live it on a daily basis. In this BBC World Service film, we hear the story of BBC Arabic's Reporter in Gaza, Adnan El-Bursh who found himself reporting the news, as he was living through it.\n\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK only) or on the BBC World Service YouTube channel (outside UK)\n\nI watched the footage of my friend, who I have known for 20 years, embracing his children's shroud-wrapped bodies in central Gaza. I wished I was there with him.\n\nThe news came amid a string of reports about the deaths of other friends, relatives and neighbours. My heart ached. I have now lost about 200 people in the war.\n\nThat day I wept live on air, as I was reporting. In the night, I woke up with tears covering my cheeks. Wael's image never left my mind.\n\nI have covered conflicts in Gaza for 15 years, but this war stands apart, from the unprecedented attack that triggered it, to the scale of the losses.\n\nAt 06:15 on 7 October I was woken by loud explosions and my children screaming. I went up to the rooftop and saw rockets being launched towards Israel from Gaza.\n\nWhen we realised Hamas had breached the fence into Israel - in its assault that saw about 1,200 people killed and 250 taken hostage - we knew the response from Israel would be like nothing we had seen before.\n\nMore than 34,000 people have now been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The risk of injury and death has been ever-present.\n\nTwo days into the war, I hurried to our local market in Jabalia, to stock up with food. It was busy with others doing the same.\n\nBut the area was bombed heavily just 10 minutes after I left. The entire place was destroyed, including the large grocery store where I had shopped moments earlier.\n\nI knew the faces of the shop owners. Many of them were among the dead.\n\nAmnesty International says at least 69 people were killed in the attack and that it should be investigated as a war crime.\n\nThe Israeli military has not responded to the BBC's question about this incident.\n\nThroughout the war it has said its operation is targeting Hamas, which it says operates from civilian locations.\n\nIt also says \"strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law\".\n\nBefore the war, Jabalia was a beautiful, tranquil town. I was born there and had been living a simple, contented life with my family, filled with love and plans for the future.\n\nI had a farm east of the town, where I had planted olive, lemon, and orange trees with my own hands. It was peaceful and I loved to drink tea there after work.\n\nThe day we decided to flee northern Gaza for Khan Younis - leaving our homes and the BBC office in Gaza City behind - was a pivotal moment in my life.\n\nWith more than 10 people crammed into one car, my family and I crawled our way south, along a single road, with tens of thousands of other people, on foot and in vehicles, all loaded with belongings.\n\nThe journey was punctuated by air strikes on nearby areas on both sides of the road. Confusion, grief and uncertainty marked the faces of my family and the crowds.\n\nThe children kept asking me: \"Where are we going? Will we be back tomorrow?\"\n\nI really wish I had taken our photo album, full of pictures of me as a young child, my parents, and my wife and I when we got engaged. My dad was an Arabic teacher and I also wish I had taken some of his books that I kept after he died.\n\nLater, I learned from a neighbour that my house had been completely destroyed, and my farm burned.\n\nAfter that terrifying and surreal journey south, and our night outside the Red Crescent headquarters, I continued working from Khan Younis for several weeks. My family were still in Nuseirat and being separated from them took a toll emotionally.\n\nThen, in early December, Israel began telling Gazans to leave parts of Khan Younis and move to other areas, including Rafah, further south.\n\nThe Israeli military also closed the main road leading north, which connected me and my family. I did not know how I would get to them or where we should go if I did. Rafah was already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of people, and there was barely anywhere to stay.\n\nFor days, I grappled with swirling emotions. News circulated about Israeli forces advancing towards the main roads, apparently aiming to divide the south from the central and northern regions. I was terrified that I - or my family - would be killed and we would never see each other again.\n\nFor the first time I felt like I had lost it. I did not even know what day it was. I considered stopping work and returning to my family. If we died, we would die together.\n\nIn the end, on 11 December, I drove with a colleague along a back road to Nuseirat. When I arrived, my youngest children rushed up to hug me, with Razan reaching round my neck and holding on tight.\n\nWe managed to move the family to Rafah. The BBC team had also relocated there, continuing to report. There were some awful moments.\n\nIn late December, I reported as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) handed about 80 bodies to the authorities in Gaza. The IDF said it had taken them from Gaza to Israel so they could be checked to see if there were any hostages among them.\n\nA large lorry drove into the cemetery in the Rafah area. The stench was overwhelming when the container was opened. Men in aprons and masks placed the remains, wrapped in blue plastic, in a mass grave dug by an excavator in the sandy ground.\n\nI had never seen a scene like that before. It is hard to describe how horrible it was.\n\nThen, in January, I was reporting from a hospital in Rafah when several bodies were brought in, including another of Wael Al-Dahdouh's sons, Hamza, his eldest, who was also a journalist working for Al Jazeera.\n\nWho would tell Wael? It just seemed impossible, after the tragedies he had already faced. I could not even listen as one of my colleagues called someone close to Wael to pass on the news.\n\nHamza and his colleague, freelance videographer Mustafa Thuraya, were killed in an Israeli air strike on their car, after they had reported on the aftermath of another strike in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military alleges they were \"were members of Gaza-based terrorist organisations\". The families and Al Jazeera reject the claims as false.\n\nThe IDF says the two were operating drones \"posing an imminent threat to IDF troops\", but a Washington Post investigation \"found no indications that either man was operating as anything other than a journalist that day\".\n\nMore than 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to Reporters Without Borders - the vast majority are known to be Palestinian.\n\nThe IDF says it \"has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists\".\n\nIt says it \"takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists\", but \"remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks\".\n\nEventually, the news came that the BBC team's families had permission to leave Gaza. Four weeks later, we too finally left through the Rafah crossing, facilitated by the Egyptian authorities.\n\nI am writing this in Qatar. But I know that in Jabalia, they have been pulling up grass and grinding animal feed to eat, while I'm here having meals in a clean hotel. I find it hard to eat - it's like eating poison.\n\nThe future is a blur. Gaza is my life. I want to return one day, but for now, that seems impossible.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/032139515394448c7c70cd03eb8936bc", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 452044077, "relevance": 3, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b7b"}

About 275 people were arrested on Saturday at various campuses including Indiana University at Bloomington, Arizona State University and Washington University in St. Louis. The number of arrests nationwide approached 900 since New York police removed a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at Columbia University and arrested more than 100 demonstrators on April 18.\n\nSince then, students have dug in at dozens of pro-Palestinian encampments around the country, prompting a range of responses from administrators: arrests and criminal charges, student suspensions or simply continued pleas to leave. The plight of students has become a central part of protests, with both the students and a growing number of faculty demanding amnesty for protesters. At issue is whether the suspensions and legal records will follow students through their adult lives.\n\nFaculty members at universities in California, Georgia and Texas have initiated or passed largely symbolic votes of no confidence in their leadership.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said President Joe Biden \"knows that there are very strong feelings\" but would leave managing the protests to local authorities.\n\n\"People should have the ability to air their views and to share their perspectives publicly but it has to be peaceful,\" Kirby said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nIn an interview that aired Sunday, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called it \"a dangerous situation\" and placed the responsibility with college administrators.\n\n\"There's also antisemitism, which is completely unacceptable. I've been shocked to see that in this country,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"HOW IT STARTED\n\nEarly protests at Columbia University in New York City sparked pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the country and students and administrators there have engaged in negotiations, the university said in a statement Saturday night.\n\nColumbia has set a series of deadlines for protesters to leave the encampment -- which they have missed -- but bringing back police \"at this time\" would be counterproductive, the school wrote in an email to students.\n\nOn Sunday, students walked among dozens of colorful tents that continue to stand.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nAt the University of California, Los Angeles, police set up barricades before hundreds of demonstrators on both sides joined a growing crowd Sunday near where pro-Palestinian students have been staying around-the-clock in tents. Counter-protesters who organized a \"Stand in Support of Jewish Students\" rally said their goal was to \"stand up against hatred and antisemitism.\"\n\nAcross town, the University of Southern California said it was open Sunday after being shut down a day earlier because of what the university called vandalism and disruptions.\n\nUSC drew criticism after refusing to allow the valedictorian, who has publicly supported the Palestinian cause, to make a commencement speech. Administrators then scrapped the keynote speech by filmmaker Jon M. Chu. Last week the school announced the cancelation of its main graduation event, a day after more than 90 protesters were arrested by police in riot gear.\n\nIn the northern part of the state, officials on Saturday ordered an \"enforced hard closure\" of California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. Two halls remained occupied by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. The school said Sunday that the cost of the occupation -- including damage done by \"theft, vandalism and graffiti\" -- was estimated to be in the millions.\n\nMISSOURI\n\nWashington University in St. Louis locked some campus buildings and arrested protesters Saturday. Photos showed uniformed police attempting to remove masked protesters as others, also wearing masks, linked arms to thwart the efforts.\n\nIn a statement, the university said more than 100 people -- including 23 students and four university employees -- were arrested on suspicion of trespassing. Megan Green, president of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen, said in a social media post that she was present and the protest remained calm \"until the police came in like an ambush.\"\n\nGreen Party presidential candidate Jill Stein said in a social media post that she and two of her campaign managers were among those arrested.\n\nThe university's statement defended the action and said protesters \"did not have good intentions on our campus and that this demonstration had the potential to get out of control and become dangerous.\"\n\nSome arrested also face charges of resisting arrest and assault, including for injuries to three police officers, the statement said. Those injuries include a severe concussion, a broken finger and a groin injury.\n\nThe Missouri chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations condemned the arrests as \"heavy-handed.\"\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nIn Boston, police in riot gear cleared an encampment on the campus of Northeastern University on Saturday.\n\nMassachusetts State Police said about 102 protesters were arrested and will be charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct.\n\nNortheastern said in a statement that the demonstration, which began two days ago, had become \"infiltrated by professional organizers\" with no affiliation to the university and antisemitic slurs, including \"kill the Jews,\" had been used.\n\nThe Huskies for a Free Palestine student group disputed the university's account, saying in a statement that counterprotesters were to blame for the slurs and no student protesters \"repeated the disgusting hate speech.\"\n\nStudents at the Boston protest said a counterprotester attempted to instigate hate speech but insisted their event was peaceful.\n\nUS CAMPUSES AND THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR\n\nThe nationwide campus protests began in response to Israel's offensive in Gaza. Hamas launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza. In the ensuing war, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the local health ministry.\n\nIsrael and its supporters have branded the university protests as antisemitic, while critics of Israel say it uses such allegations to silence opponents. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

There are no major issues in the observations and inquiries submitted by Hamas regarding the contents\" of the proposal, said the Hamas official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official added that a Hamas delegation led by the movement's senior leader, Khalil al-Hayya, will deliver the group's response to the truce proposal during a meeting with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo on Monday.\n\nEgypt has also invited the Israeli delegation to travel to Cairo on Monday to \"speed up the process and provide the necessary clarifications,\" according to an Egyptian source quoted by Qatari-owned outlet Al-Arabi Al-Jadid.\n\nEgypt, which along with Qatar and the United States has been unsuccessfully trying to broker a new Gaza truce deal ever since a one-week halt to the fighting in November, sent a high-level delegation to Israel on Friday to discuss the latest proposal.\n\nDuring his call with Netanyahu, the White House said Biden highlighted the joint statement he organized last week with the leaders of 17 other countries, demanding Hamas immediately release the remaining 133 hostages it is holding in Gaza in what would allow for an immediate ceasefire and relief for civilians in the Strip.\n\nThe US president also reiterated his \"ironclad\" commitment to Israel's security, which was on display during the jointly thwarted Iranian missile and drone attack earlier this month, according to the White House readout.\n\nThe White House added that Biden reiterated his \"clear position\" on Israel's looming plans to invade Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. The US has said it cannot support the operation unless it ensures the full protection of the over one million Palestinians sheltering there and doesn't believe that Israel will be able to safely evacuate and care for that many civilians.\n\nThe two leaders also discussed the opening of additional crossings into northern Gaza later this week to allow more aid into the Strip, which will be critical if Israel goes ahead with its plans for the Rafah operation.\n\nIsrael is among the countries US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit as he returns to the Middle East on Monday, on his seventh trip to the region since October 7. The US State Department said Blinken was scheduled to visit Israel and Jordan on Wednesday.\n\nThe terms of the current Israeli-backed proposal have not been published but are reported to provide for the release of 33 living hostages who meet a so-called \"humanitarian\" designation -- that is, women, children, men aged over 50 and the sick. In return, Israel would release a far larger number of Palestinian security prisoners, including many with blood on their hands.\n\nAmid fierce debate within the Israeli government as the diplomatic efforts for a deal stepped up over the weekend, Hebrew media channels reported that Jerusalem was willing to make further major concessions such as allowing the return of residents to northern Gaza, and possibly to do so without the preferred checks to prevent Hamas members from returning with them.\n\nIsrael has also indicated a willingness to withdraw forces from the so-called Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, according to a Channel 12 report on Saturday.\n\nThis report also said the terms being conveyed would provide for a subsequent phase of negotiations, in which an end to the war and the release of all further hostages would be discussed. It stressed that Israel would not have to commit to ending the war as a condition for the initial release of the 33 \"humanitarian\" hostages.\n\nHamas has since the November deal conditioned the release of any further hostages on Israel ending the war -- a demand Netanyahu has rejected as delusional.\n\nResponding to the Channel 12 report, a senior Israeli official told The Times of Israel on Saturday that \"Israel did not agree to an end to the war, to a withdrawal from the Strip, or to other demands that Hamas presented.\"\n\nThe war in Gaza erupted after Hamas's October 7 massacre, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages, mostly civilians, many amid acts of brutality and sexual assault.\n\nIsrael estimates that 129 hostages remain in Gaza -- not all of them alive -- after 105 civilians were released from Hamas captivity during a weeklong truce in late November. Four hostages were released prior to that, and three were rescued by troops. The bodies of eight hostages have also been recovered and three hostages were mistakenly killed by the military. One more person has been listed as missing since October 7, and their fate is still unknown.\n\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza claims that more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in the war, but the number cannot be independently verified as it is believed to include both Hamas terrorists and civilians, some of whom were killed as a consequence of the terror group's own rocket misfires.\n\nThe IDF says it has killed over 13,000 terrorists in Gaza, in addition to some 1,000 who were killed inside Israel on and immediately following October 7. The army also says 261 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the ground invasion.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tel_aviv@timesofisrael.com", "name": "Tel Aviv", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/04/F240427AVS105-e1714346826719.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9515473", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 452043927, "relevance": 9, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b7e"}

Public opinion in the framing of this term is usually based on the idea of writer, academics, media and intellectuals from the West who belong to a small group of people with power, authority and at times, wealth.\n\nOn many occasions when the phrase international community is used, there is a particular group that wants to get a certain position agreed on, a consensus or accord, on a 'global' issue to give it relevance and show how 'serious' the matter is.\n\nWithout being stated explicitly, the \"international community\" appears to be made up of North America (the United States and Canada), (Western) Europe, a few other nations that are unavoidable due to their strength or membership in the UN Security Council.\n\nAlso, countries with the appropriate historical, cultural, or, more specifically, racial background like Australia, Israel and New Zealand are also famed as members of this community. Despite representations as the \"international community\", when these countries deliberate, it has not always reflected that their agenda is legitimate. Or that the views of their countries' leaders do mirror the aspirations of their people, in a democratic fashion.\n\nThus, the \"international community\" worked heavily against Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2020, to give a tag to the African country as being an isolated, pariah, rogue or failed state by instigating illegal regime change activities.\n\nThe \"other community\", however, dismissed the consensus and public opinion that the so-called international community sought to establish against Zimbabwe.\n\nBased on their international alliance, this community stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" against Zimbabwe by creating narratives that promoted instability within Zimbabwe's borders. During this time, it was China, Cuba, Iran, Russia and South Africa, among others, which stood firm with Zimbabwe.\n\nThis process has been implemented by the \"international community\" against China and Russia, but have failed because the two countries, plus the US, are the only three great powers the world has, hence difficult to sideline.\n\nLikewise, there are strategic reasons why the \"international community\" is now keen on getting a consensus against Iran. These are the nations linked by a particular form of Eurocentrism, if not outright racism, that can also be interpreted as ethno-tribalism.\n\nWestern media, which carries traditional hostility Iran, has in the past few weeks trying to enrage the world against Iran as a policy of \"Persian hatred\" that was started by former US president Donald Trump.\n\nThe hatred has been thick such that the USA has always wanted an opportunity to \"obliterate Iran\". This ought to be seen in the context that the US-led \"international community\" which has repeatedly used the threat of nuclear weapons against Iran.\n\nAt last year's 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a dark warning to Tehran, threatening the country with a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Above all, Iran must face a credible nuclear threat,\" said Netanyahu.\n\nThis nuclear threat that the Israeli authorities later retracted saying Netanyahu had misspoken, is now viewed as war policy along the grain of this long anti-Iran history. Like President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly advocated for the \"obliteration of Iran\", which essentially means use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nFor instance, in May 2019, President Trump wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that \"if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran\".\n\nIn other posts, President Trump said that the United States would attack Iran with \"great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration\". These threats are genocidal in nature.\n\nBecause of these constant genocidal threats towards Iran, it becomes evident that other great powers take notice, hence China and Russia have and had no alternative but to move towards Iran as moral towers to diffuse the likely propensity by the \"international community\" bloc to use nuclear weapons. They have used nuclear weapons before. This is also important to ensure that Iran is not \"isolated\" because it is a regional power in south-west Asia to build a new alliance of strategic cooperation.\n\nIn Chinese and Russian official media outlets, Iran's support has been formalised and given out with certainty. Against Iran, China has condemned the use of the US' \"long-arm jurisdiction\".\n\nThe long-arm jurisdiction treacherously permits the United States to contend that it has the authority to bring legal action against other nations based on domestic legislation rather than international law.\n\nThis US conceit has been so since the collapse of the USSR, a set of states including Zimbabwe and Iran, have faced the brunt of US force being called rogue states, pariah states, failed states and even labelled state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nTo try and separate China and Russia from Iran, key facts that need to be kept in mind include that the US imposed economic pressure on China leading to a trade war. Secondly, the US also deliberately destroyed relations with Russia, sanctioning the country and expanding NATO eastwards and threatening Russia's security leading to a special military operation in Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, the US' waging of economic warfare against Iran through sanctions heavily impacts China and other countries that will have difficulties to purchase Iran's oil and to continue normal trade.\n\nSuch pressures have brought convergence to China, Iran and Russia in their resoluteness to defend the rest of the world against a racially skewed \"international community\" that only favours the US-led narratives that are detrimental to the interests of others.\n\nThis triad attraction and convergence is cementing as a reaction to the pressure from the West. US behaviour has initiated the speed at which this convergence has been made to enable increased future ties.\n\nIt should be therefore known that the \"international community\" is nothing but a bloc driven by westomania. This is among other reasons why the China-Iran-Russia triad is converging because if any of the three countries falter, the \"other community\" will also falter.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Israels-Prime-Minister-Bi-007.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520856", "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 452043883, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b7f"}

Six months on from the October 7 attacks, and with the Israeli scorched-earth response ongoing, it seemed timely to talk again to Loewenstein.\n\nHis thesis is that repressive states crave the battle-proven defence and surveillance technology Israel has deployed in Gaza.\n\n\"On the face of it, October 7 shows Israel's multi-billion-dollar intelligence military apparatus failed,\" he says. \"Israel was caught asleep at the wheel, the military disappeared for hours, the wall, the surveillance, all disappeared or was knocked out by Hamas very effectively.\n\n\"You would think that would diminish the image of Israel as a technical marvel. I would argue that in fact the opposite is happening.\"\n\nAgainst the background of entire suburbs being flattened by Israeli munitions, and seemingly every movement of Palestinians - would-be guerrillas and civilians alike - tracked by drones and sensors, personal direct text messages being monitored and the exploration and destruction of the Hamas tunnel network, Israeli defence companies have continued to exhibit at major arms shows and sell their technology.\n\n\"Israel has spent the past six months testing and showing huge amounts of new weapons: drones, quadcopters, surveillance tech and various other equipment in Gaza,\" says Loewenstein. \"It's too early to know exactly who's buying that equipment. We do know, in the past six months, for example, that Israel has had a large presence at arms fairs.\"\n\nStocks soar\n\nAlthough some technology failed on October 7, the incursion was mostly seen as a governmental and intelligence failure to which the answer might be more gear.\n\n\"The companies that have deployed the technology and other surveillance tech on the border that failed haven't taken a step back. If anything, they've simply, very clinically, said, 'Let's not look at the past. Let's focus on the fact that we are now the saviours of Israel.' In other words, 'You need us to protect Israel.\"'\n\nThe main publicly listed Israeli defence companies - IAI, Elbit, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems - have done record business since the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago and their stock prices have generally performed strongly this year.\n\nGlobal interest\n\nLife for Loewenstein has become more intense, as it has for many Jews in the diaspora, as well as in Israel. His book was somehow even more relevant and people worldwide wanted to know more about the failure of Israeli intelligence represented by the October 7 massacre and the implications of the devastating response.\n\n\"It's been very, very difficult. My book came out before October 7 and was doing pretty well. I got a lot of attention. Then October 7 happened and it's just exploded in ways that I could never have imagined. I wake up every day to interview requests from every corner of the globe.\"\n\nThe Sydney-based Loewenstein was already no stranger to attacks from fellow Jews and come-what-may backers of Israel. His journalism has been highly critical of the Israeli state and what he sees as decades of repression of Palestinians. His 2007 book, My Israel Question, was a searing indictment of Zionism and his rejection of it as a Jew.\n\nHe says Israel is profiting financially and in regional and global influence by demonstrating its military effectiveness and the depth of its monitoring capabilities. Far from failing on October 7 - a failing that may land on the military and not its equipment - Israel is exploiting the power of its weaponry deployed in Gaza.\n\nArab states that signed the so-called Abraham Accords (United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco) to normalise relations with Israel under the Trump administration have stuck with the relationship, as has Saudi Arabia, which had been close to establishing normal relations before October 7.\n\nIn each case, the authoritarian regimes may pay lip service to suppressed domestic protests against the Israeli destruction of Gaza, but in the end, Loewenstein believes, their political elites want access to Israel and its technology.\n\n\"None of them have cut ties and none of them will. I'm talking about the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Bahrainis, the list goes on. They know their people, in general, are very against what Israel is doing. And, to some extent, they have to show deference to that anger.\n\n\"But ultimately, I would argue that these nations are increasingly fearful of their own people for a range of reasons of which Palestine is one among many. They feel like they need the most sophisticated, repressive technology that they're buying from Israel to control their own people.\"\n\nLoewenstein expresses gloom about the outlook for Palestinians and for Israel, a country he sees as in the grip of a right wing that dehumanises Palestinians. Israel, he says, has no intention of bowing to what he sees as illusory and performative demands for a two-state solution - one which all who talk about it cynically know will never happen.\n\nIsrael radicalised\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be personally unpopular, but his policies and the right-wing elements in his coalition are popular, especially after October 7. Loewenstein says Israel is increasingly on a course that assumes Israeli ethnic superiority. Its uncompromising stance combines with extreme ideas of the end of days on the religious right to create sometimes odd bedfellows on the hard right of populist politics worldwide, especially given the history of the Holocaust.\n\n\"There is a major constituency in Israel for an ongoing war for endless occupation. Israeli society has been radicalised very strongly for years. October 7 has certainly made that even stronger.\"\n\nThe hideous bragging videos of atrocities and the dehumanisation of Palestinians posted by Israeli soldiers involve \"not just a few bad apples,\" he says. \"No. A massive amount of Israeli soldiers in cars are filming themselves on TikTok dehumanising Palestinians and this is not a handful of soldiers. This is ubiquitous.\"\n\nDuring our Zoom conversation, Loewenstein made a striking observation that put the scale of the destruction in Gaza into a historical context - one which should have been obvious but was somehow lost in the immediacy of the conflict: this war has displaced hundreds of thousands more people than the expulsion (or withdrawal, depending on who is telling the story) of Palestinians in 1948. The UN estimates 1.7 million people have been displaced in Gaza. In 1948, about 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled the region.\n\nKnown to Palestinians as the Nakba or Catastrophe, it is the origin of the occupation of the West Bank, the creation of an isolated Gaza Strip, and the status of Palestinians as refugees in camps created in that era, many of which are still there 75 years later. It's a scary calculus when you think how long the effects of the war against Hamas may last. \"What's happening now is on a scale far bigger than 1948. There's more displacement. And the killing was not even close to where we are now,\" he says of the more than 33,000 people reported killed in Gaza.\n\n\"We all know that this is going to take literally decades to rebuild.\"\n\nHe expects a generational explosion of anti-Israel and anti-Western sentiment across the Arab world.\n\nSlow dawning\n\nWith most domestic media in Israel reporting a strongly Israeli perspective on the conflict, and with social media tending to channel discussion into pre-existing camps, Loewenstein sees no sign that the Israeli public recognise the scale of the Gaza crisis or the likelihood they will live with its consequences for decades to come.\n\nNetanyahu may be the bogeyman, but he represents, or is in cahoots with, a large and robust portion of Israelis and certainly of Israeli hard-right politicians. He continues to face corruption charges, but he may well be replaced by someone just as hardline. Settlers continue to expand territory in the West Bank and even propose going to Gaza.\n\n\"It's fair to say that it's hard not to be even more despairing now than I would have been when we spoke [last July],\" Loewenstein says. \"Things are so grim.

There were others outside the Ukraine context.\n\nDonbas formed into two independent republics in response to the anti-Russian coup orchestrated by the United States that overthrew the elected Ukrainian government. Putin's first strategic blunder was in permitting Washington's overthrow of the democratically elected Ukrainian government.\n\nIn 2014 after the overthrow of the Ukrainian government the two independent Donbas republics voted overwhelmingly, as did Crimea, to be reincorporated into Russia. Putin accepted Crimea's request, as otherwise Russia would lose its Black Sea naval base, but rejected the request of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics.\n\nThis was Putin's second strategic blunder. If Putin or the Kremlin or the Russian government had given equal treatment to Donetsk and Luhansk a decade ago in 2014, there would have been no limited military operation with Ukraine. Neither Ukraine, NATO, nor Washington would dared to have attacked Russian territory in order to \"recover Donbass.\"\n\nIf the US persisted in bringing Ukraine into NATO, Putin would have been forced to recognize that he was at war with the West and that he had no alternative but to reestablish Ukraine to its many centuries existence as a part of Russia.

Besides Jack, who was Trump's political director during his administration and worked for then-U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they included former state senators Mike Crane and Mike Dugan, former state Rep. Philip Singleton and party activist Jim Bennett.\n\nThey're seeking to replace Republican U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson, who is stepping down. The district hugs the Alabama border from Carrollton to Columbus and swings east into the Atlanta suburbs of Newnan and Peachtree City.\n\nJack repeatedly referenced his work in the Trump administration, promising that in Congress he would continue that work.\n\n\"To sell myself, I think that I will look at the record of accomplishment and success that we had and we delivered in that administration,\" Jack said.\n\nOthers largely passed on the chance to attack Jack, although Crane suggested that McCarthy is the one trying to anoint Jack, asking voters who should choose their representative.\n\n\"Do you want to take responsibility for that vote or do you want to let Washington, D.C., insiders do what they've done for the last several cycles, and that is choose the next representative for the 3rd District?\" Crane asked.\n\nBut attacks on Jack, the fundraising leader in the race, were mostly muted. Crane, Bennett and Singleton staked out more conservative positions, with each saying they would join the Freedom Caucus if elected.\n\nSingleton was often at odds with GOP leadership during his time in the state House, attacking then-Speaker David Ralston's leadership, with top Republicans then drawing Singleton into a majority Democratic district. Singleton, though, said he's \"not an oppositional guy.\"\n\n\"You go and you fight for the principles that you believe in, you stand for,\" Singleton said. \"I'm not someone that fights against people. I fight for good policy.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether human embryos should have the same rights as people, Jack echoed Trump's position that restrictions on reprodutive rights should be left to the states. Dugan noted he voted for Georgia's current abortion restrictions, which ban abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected. That's typically after about six weeks, often before a woman knows she is pregnant.\n\nBut Dugan said restriction of in vitro fertilization was \"a deeper question,\" not saying clearly how he would vote.\n\nThe other three, though, voiced no doubts about implementing a legal standard that could lead to a total ban on abortion in Georgia and a ban on in vitro fertilization as currently practiced.\n\n\"I'm against recreational abortion,\" Bennett said. \"I believe that life does exist from the moment of conception. There's no wiggle room for me.\"\n\nAll of the candidates, in a show of hands, said they believed Trump was the rightful winner of Georgia's 16 electoral votes in 2020, despite no reliable evidence to contradict Democrat Joe Biden's win. Several said they believed Republican-backed changes to Georgia's election laws since then made them more at ease, but Bennett attacked the continued use of Dominion ballot marking devices, echoing a common belief among Republican activists that all voting machines should be distrusted.\n\nAll of the candidates voiced support for more restrictions on immigration, with several including Jack saying they support mass deportations of people who have entered the country illegally. Jack said he would have voted against the recent foreign aid package to Ukraine, Israel and others until he was satisfied on border security.\n\nDugan said he believed Republicans were right to reject a proposed bill on border security that the Biden administration had backed.\n\n\"I don't think anybody trusted Joe Biden to secure our southern border,\" Dugan said.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/preview-2408.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520974", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 452044602, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b85"}

But, really, it came down to only two men: Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nWashington's annual mashup of political humor and earnest paeans to the free press is typically a good-natured collection of one-liners and affectionate jabs at friends and enemies alike. But it was the leading 2024 presidential contenders who loomed largest - one in the Washington Hilton hotel ballroom, the other who definitely, positively, probably was not watching from Mar-a-Lago. Unless, of course, he was.\n\n\"The 2024 election is in full swing and, yes, age is an issue,\" President Biden told the black-tie crowd. \"I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.\"\n\n\"Can we just acknowledge how refreshing it is,\" comedian Colin Jost later added, \"to see a president of the United States at an event that doesn't begin with a bailiff saying, 'All rise!'\"\n\nFor most of the evening, Trump ignored the dinner and posted instead about presidential immunity and political witch hunts. Shortly after 1 a.m., he finally chimed in on Truth Social: \"The White House Correspondents' Dinner was really bad. Colin Jost BOMBED, and Crooked Joe was an absolute disaster! Doesn't get much worse than this!\"\n\nSo, basically, another day on the campaign trail.\n\nBut for the denizens of Washington's political media, it was a special occasion. The correspondents' dinner is ostensibly a playful celebration of the codependent relationship between Washington politicians and reporters who spend the rest of the year covering them and deadly serious issues: Trump's legal trials, looming uncertainty about what will happen in November (and beyond), the Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIt proved hard to put all that aside for the night. Especially Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protesters surrounded the entrance outside of the hotel, shouting chants such as, \"Western media, you can't hide! We charge you with genocide!\" and confronting guests arriving to the dinner in their tuxedos and gowns. Some attendees were followed by tight circles of protesters yelling \"Shame!\" inches from their faces until they could get behind police.\n\n\"I came in through a different entrance, so I didn't hear exactly what they are chanting,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), running up an escalator to the lobby. \"But there are tens of thousands of people being blown to bits in Gaza, so I understand why they are protesting. I stand with the movement - depending on what they are saying.\"\n\nThe experience of walking the gantlet of activists seemed to have left a lot of people somewhat stunned. But inside the ballroom, it was all smiles and hugs and back slaps.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) charmed everyone, wearing a big smile and a \"FREE EVAN\" pin in honor of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) gave a report on his own encounter with the protesters outside: \"I asked them about what was happening in Sudan. And they yelled louder. And then I asked them about the concentration camps full of Uyghurs. And they yelled louder. And then I went inside.\" Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for New York Magazine, got off a presidential zinger of her own: \"I can't hear a thing in here - I feel like Biden.\"\n\nBiden's own zingers were directed almost entirely at his opponent.\n\n\"Trump's so desperate, he started reading those Bibles he's selling,\" the president said. \"Then he got to the First Commandment: 'You shall have no other gods before me.' That's when he put it down and said, 'This book's not for me.'\"\n\nBut the president soon dispensed with the yuks and pivoted to what felt like a stump speech about the clear and present danger posed by Trump and his movement. He called on the journalists in the room to report \"truth over lies.\" He implored them to move past the election horse race stories and focus on American democracy. \"The stakes couldn't be higher,\" he said. No punchline.\n\nOfficially, the evening is nonpartisan, and the only toast of the night goes to the sitting president, regardless of party affiliation. Unofficially, the dinner has always been perceived as a hotbed of Washington elites who lean left, regardless of media affiliation.\n\nTrump, who was famously roasted by President Barack Obama at the 2011 dinner, never attended the event as president. His relentless criticism of the mainstream media caused many news organizations to threaten a boycott of the dinner in 2017; Trump announced that he would not attend. He skipped two following years and even counterprogrammed with a MAGA rally instead. The party soldiered on, reinforcing a commitment to the role of a free press in a democracy, and many breathed a not-so-discreet sigh of relief when the crowd resumed in 2022 after the worst of the pandemic with Biden carrying the torch.\n\nThe only Trump spotted at this year's festivities was daughter-in-law Lara Trump, recently crowned co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Her father-in-law wasn't in the building, but comic impressionist Matt Friend emerged from the crowd with a Trump impersonation - as well as sendups of Bernie Sanders, Mitch McConnell and Obama. He also made the first (and, surprisingly, only) dead-dog joke of the night.\n\n\"I am killing this dinner harder than Kristi Noem kills the puppies,\" Friend said in his Trump voice, riffing off the news that the Republican governor of South Dakota, in a forthcoming book, admits to shooting her 14-month-old dog because she was \"untrainable\" and aggressive.\n\nLet's face it: It's a tough room for a comedian. Jost, co-anchor of \"Saturday Night Live's\" \"Weekend Update,\" sat at the head table next to the president and nearby first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and WHCA President Kelly O'Donnell, senior White House correspondent for NBC News. His speech came after Biden's and felt like one of his SNL bits: Some jokes got laughs, others landed awkwardly.\n\nThere were a few jabs at Biden, a \"decent\" man who Jost said reminds him of his beloved grandfather, a Staten Island firefighter. There were also some uneven one-liners about the press, but the press never laughs at itself, so it's hard to know whether they were good or bad jokes.\n\nJost took several swipes at the former president, too: \"I love that Trump's two attacks on Biden are that he's a senile old man and a criminal mastermind. I think you've got to pick one. Personally, I don't know any criminal masterminds who bike to get ice cream.\" On the courtroom drawings that have emerged from the trials: \"Every sketch of Trump looks like the Grinch had sex with the Lorax.\"\n\nJost brought the evening's most glamorous celebrity: movie star Scarlett Johansson, whom he married in 2020. What started a century ago as an annual gathering of reporters and their subjects morphed into the \"Nerd Prom\" about 35 years ago - a red carpet extravaganza where news organizations battle to host administration officials, Hollywood A-listers, corporate heavyweights and anyone else basking in their 15 minutes of fame. Within the throngs are a few people who actually work as White House correspondents.\n\nWith some exceptions, this year's guest list fell solidly into B-list territory: Jon Hamm, Chris Pine, Keri Russell, Molly Ringwald, Rosario Dawson, Jon Cryer, Caitlyn Jenner, Billy Porter, Lorne Michaels.\n\nBefore the speeches, the WHCA handed out its awards for excellence. The award for overall excellence went to Barak Ravid of Axios, Peter Baker of the New York Times received the print award for deadline reporting, and Tamara Keith of NPR received the broadcast award in the same category - all singled out for stories following Hamas's Oct. 7 attack in Israel. Doug Mills of the Times got the award for visual journalism for a striking photo of Biden, and the award for courage and accountability went to The Washington Post for coverage on the impact of assault rifles and mass shootings.\n\nThe evening ended, as it always does: with an impassioned defense of democracy and the critical role of the press in preserving it.\n\nJost had his own thoughts about the media. \"Your words speak truth to power. Your words bring light to the darkness.\" Then he paused and grinned, \"And most importantly, your words train the AI programs that will soon replace you.\"\n\nBiden ended with a toast of his own: \"To a free press. To an informed citizenry. To an America where freedom and democracy endure. God bless America.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/28/PDTN/73494894007-correspondents-j-3-pv-7-iolqtjwhe-6-wb-6-pgwqwow-4.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3497,1968,x0,y304&format=pjpg&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-9519637", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 452044548, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b86"}

Francisco Seco/Associated Press\n\nKYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine's troops have been forced to make a tactical retreat from three villages in the embattled east, the country's army chief said Sunday, warning of a worsening battlefield situation as Ukrainian forces wait for much-needed arms from a huge U.S. aid package to reach combat zones.\n\nCol. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi reported that Russian forces continue to attack \"along the entire front line\" of more than 620 miles, with pitched battles raging west of Avdiivka, the eastern city they took in February after a grueling, monthslong fight.\n\n\"The most difficult situation is in the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions, where fierce battles continue,\" Syrskyi's said in an update posted to the Telegram messaging app, referencing two Ukrainian-held cities in the war-torn Donetsk region, once a hub of industry.\n\n\"The enemy has engaged up to four brigades in these directions, is trying to develop an offensive west of Avdiivka and Marinka, making its way to Pokrovsk and Kurakhove,\" Syrskyi added. \"Units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, preserving the lives and health of our defenders, moved to new frontiers west of Berdychi, Semenivka and Novomykhailivka.\"\n\nTwo of these front-line villages lie less than 31 miles east of Pokrovsk, while the third is located just over 19 miles by road from Kurakhove.\n\nA Washington-based think tank predicted late Saturday that Russian forces \"will likely make significant tactical gains in thec coming weeks,\" as acute ammunition shortages continue to hobble Ukraine's defense efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its latest operational assessment, the Institute for the Study of War said that Moscow's forces have opportunities to push forward around Avdiivka, and also threaten nearby Chasiv Yar. Its capture would give Russia control of a hilltop from which it can attack other key cities forming the backbone of Ukraine's eastern defenses.\n\nDespite this, the think tank assessed that neither of these efforts by Moscow are likely to cause Kyiv's defensive lines to collapse \"in the near term.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday confirmed that Moscow's troops had taken a village about 9 miles north of Avdiivka, days after the war institute reported on its likely capture early on Thursday. That day's assessment described Moscow's gains as \"relatively quick but still relatively marginal,\" adding that Russian troops had advanced by no more than 5 kilometers (3 miles) over the previous week.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden promised on Wednesday that U.S. weapons shipments would begin making their way into Ukraine within hours, as he signed into law a $95 billion measure -- $61 billion of which was allocated for Ukraine -- that also included assistance for Israel, Taiwan and other global hot spots. The announcement marked an end to the long, painful battle with Republicans in Congress over urgently needed assistance for Ukraine.\n\nElsewhere, Russian drones struck the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Mykolaiv early Sunday, setting a hotel ablaze and damaging infrastructure, according to local officials.\n\nVitaliy Kim, the governor of Ukraine's southern Mykolaiv province, said that the drones \"seriously damaged\" a hotel in its namesake capital, sparking a fire that was later extinguished. Kim also reported that the strike damaged heat-generating infrastructure in the city. He added that there were no casualties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussian state agency RIA reported that the strike on Mykolaiv targeted a shipyard where naval drones are assembled, as well as a hotel housing \"English-speaking mercenaries\" who have fought for Kyiv. The RIA report cited Sergei Lebedev, described as a coordinator of local pro-Moscow guerrillas. His comments couldn't be independently verified.\n\nAlso on Sunday morning, the Russian Defense Ministry said that 17 Ukrainian drones were downed overnight over four regions in the country's southwest. Three drones were intercepted near an oil depot in Lyudinovo, an industrial town about 230 kilometers (143 miles) north of the Ukrainian border, Gov. Vladislav Shapsha said.\n\nOne of the Ukrainian drones damaged communications infrastructure in Russia's southern Belgorod province, which borders Ukraine, Gov. Vyachaslav Gladkov said later on Sunday. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry claimed Sunday that its forces had destroyed ammunition depots and military equipment housed at three airports across Ukraine, including assault drones stored at Kamyanka Airfield in the country's east. The ministry's online update said the attacks took place over the last 24 hours. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.\n\nRussian shelling on Saturday and overnight wounded at least seven civilians across Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. A 36-year-old woman was pulled alive from the rubble after Russian shells on Sunday morning destroyed her home in the northeastern Kharkiv region, the local administration reported. Her 52-year-old neighbor was also rushed to a hospital with a stomach wound, the administration said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nHow an inclusive gym brand became a battlefield over LGBTQ rights filed under: russia, ukraine Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/04/Russia_Ukraine_War_99327_94345a-1714348235.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9519715", "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 452044467, "relevance": 9, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b87"}

Others have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said.\n\nAn appliance maker in southern China is finding it hard to ship its products to Russia, not because of any problems with the gadgets but because China's big banks are throttling payments for such transactions out of concern over U.S. sanctions. To settle payments for its electrical goods, the Guangdong-based company is considering using currency brokers active along China's border with Russia, said the company's founder, Wang, who asked to be identified only by his family name.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia and Russian entities since the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. Now the threat of extending these to banks in China - a country Washington blames for \"powering\" Moscow's war effort - is chilling the finance that lubricates even non-military trade from China to Russia.\n\nThis is posing a growing problem for small Chinese exporters, said seven trading and banking sources familiar with the situation. As China's big banks pull back from financing Russia-related transactions, some Chinese companies are turning to small banks on the border and underground financing channels such as money brokers - even banned cryptocurrency - the sources told Reuters.\n\nOthers have retreated entirely from the Russian market, the sources said. \"You simply cannot do business properly using the official channels,\" Wang said, as big banks now take months rather than days to clear payments from Russia, forcing him to tap unorthodox payment channels or shrink his business.\n\nGOING 'UNDERGROUND' A manager at a large state-owned bank he previously used told Wang the lender was worried about possible U.S. sanctions in dealing with Russian transactions, Wang said.\n\nA banker at one of China's Big Four state banks said it had tightened scrutiny of Russia-related businesses to avert sanctions risk. \"The main reason is to avoid unnecessary troubles,\" said the banker, who asked not to be named. Since last month, Chinese banks have intensified their scrutiny of Russia-related transactions or halted business altogether to avoid being targeted by U.S. sanctions, the sources said.\n\n\"Transactions between China and Russia will increasingly go through underground channels,\" said the head of a trade body in a southeastern province that represents Chinese businesses with Russian interests. \"But these methods carry significant risks.\" Making payments in crypto, banned in China since 2021, might be the only option, said a Moscow-based Russian banker, as \"it's impossible to pass through KYC (know-your-customer) at Chinese banks, big or small\".\n\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the topic. Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes. China's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to \"the relevant authorities\".\n\nThe People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. SANCTIONS WARNING\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed \"serious concern\" that Beijing was \"powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine\". Still, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping, was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.\n\nWhile officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the U.S. preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a U.S. official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, \"China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, \"Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security. \"Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBlinken made clear to Chinese officials \"that ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest,\" the spokesperson said. \"If China does not address this problem, the United States will.\" Nearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.\n\nSome of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion. Among the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.\n\nBy contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown. 'CHANNEL CAN BE SHUT'\n\nThe four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies. Some rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.\n\nA chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name. Calls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.\n\nBOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said. The manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.\n\n\"We gave up on the Russian market,\" the manager said. \"We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.\" Wang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.\n\n\"I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,\" he said. \"What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future. The channel can be shut completely one day.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_04_32_3060217.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "eventUri": "eng-9521083", "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452044212, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b89"}

Public opinion in the framing of this term is usually based on the idea of writer, academics, media and intellectuals from the West who belong to a small group of people with power, authority and at times, wealth.\n\nOn many occasions when the phrase international community is used, there is a particular group that wants to get a certain position agreed on, a consensus or accord, on a 'global' issue to give it relevance and show how 'serious' the matter is.\n\nWithout being stated explicitly, the \"international community\" appears to be made up of North America (the United States and Canada), (Western) Europe, a few other nations that are unavoidable due to their strength or membership in the UN Security Council.\n\nAlso, countries with the appropriate historical, cultural, or, more specifically, racial background like Australia, Israel and New Zealand are also famed as members of this community. Despite representations as the \"international community\", when these countries deliberate, it has not always reflected that their agenda is legitimate. Or that the views of their countries' leaders do mirror the aspirations of their people, in a democratic fashion.\n\nThus, the \"international community\" worked heavily against Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2020, to give a tag to the African country as being an isolated, pariah, rogue or failed state by instigating illegal regime change activities.\n\nThe \"other community\", however, dismissed the consensus and public opinion that the so-called international community sought to establish against Zimbabwe.\n\nBased on their international alliance, this community stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" against Zimbabwe by creating narratives that promoted instability within Zimbabwe's borders. During this time, it was China, Cuba, Iran, Russia and South Africa, among others, which stood firm with Zimbabwe.\n\nThis process has been implemented by the \"international community\" against China and Russia, but have failed because the two countries, plus the US, are the only three great powers the world has, hence difficult to sideline.\n\nLikewise, there are strategic reasons why the \"international community\" is now keen on getting a consensus against Iran. These are the nations linked by a particular form of Eurocentrism, if not outright racism, that can also be interpreted as ethno-tribalism.\n\nWestern media, which carries traditional hostility Iran, has in the past few weeks trying to enrage the world against Iran as a policy of \"Persian hatred\" that was started by former US president Donald Trump.\n\nThe hatred has been thick such that the USA has always wanted an opportunity to \"obliterate Iran\". This ought to be seen in the context that the US-led \"international community\" which has repeatedly used the threat of nuclear weapons against Iran.\n\nAt last year's 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a dark warning to Tehran, threatening the country with a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Above all, Iran must face a credible nuclear threat,\" said Netanyahu.\n\nThis nuclear threat that the Israeli authorities later retracted saying Netanyahu had misspoken, is now viewed as war policy along the grain of this long anti-Iran history. Like President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly advocated for the \"obliteration of Iran\", which essentially means use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nFor instance, in May 2019, President Trump wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that \"if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran\".\n\nIn other posts, President Trump said that the United States would attack Iran with \"great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration\". These threats are genocidal in nature.\n\nBecause of these constant genocidal threats towards Iran, it becomes evident that other great powers take notice, hence China and Russia have and had no alternative but to move towards Iran as moral towers to diffuse the likely propensity by the \"international community\" bloc to use nuclear weapons. They have used nuclear weapons before. This is also important to ensure that Iran is not \"isolated\" because it is a regional power in south-west Asia to build a new alliance of strategic cooperation.\n\nIn Chinese and Russian official media outlets, Iran's support has been formalised and given out with certainty. Against Iran, China has condemned the use of the US' \"long-arm jurisdiction\".\n\nThe long-arm jurisdiction treacherously permits the United States to contend that it has the authority to bring legal action against other nations based on domestic legislation rather than international law.\n\nThis US conceit has been so since the collapse of the USSR, a set of states including Zimbabwe and Iran, have faced the brunt of US force being called rogue states, pariah states, failed states and even labelled state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nTo try and separate China and Russia from Iran, key facts that need to be kept in mind include that the US imposed economic pressure on China leading to a trade war. Secondly, the US also deliberately destroyed relations with Russia, sanctioning the country and expanding NATO eastwards and threatening Russia's security leading to a special military operation in Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, the US' waging of economic warfare against Iran through sanctions heavily impacts China and other countries that will have difficulties to purchase Iran's oil and to continue normal trade.\n\nSuch pressures have brought convergence to China, Iran and Russia in their resoluteness to defend the rest of the world against a racially skewed \"international community\" that only favours the US-led narratives that are detrimental to the interests of others.\n\nThis triad attraction and convergence is cementing as a reaction to the pressure from the West. US behaviour has initiated the speed at which this convergence has been made to enable increased future ties.\n\nIt should be therefore known that the \"international community\" is nothing but a bloc driven by westomania. This is among other reasons why the China-Iran-Russia triad is converging because if any of the three countries falter, the \"other community\" will also falter.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Israels-Prime-Minister-Bi-007.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520856", "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 452043883, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b8d"}

Six months on from the October 7 attacks, and with the Israeli scorched-earth response ongoing, it seemed timely to talk again to Loewenstein.\n\nHis thesis is that repressive states crave the battle-proven defence and surveillance technology Israel has deployed in Gaza.\n\n\"On the face of it, October 7 shows Israel's multi-billion-dollar intelligence military apparatus failed,\" he says. \"Israel was caught asleep at the wheel, the military disappeared for hours, the wall, the surveillance, all disappeared or was knocked out by Hamas very effectively.\n\n\"You would think that would diminish the image of Israel as a technical marvel. I would argue that in fact the opposite is happening.\"\n\nAgainst the background of entire suburbs being flattened by Israeli munitions, and seemingly every movement of Palestinians - would-be guerrillas and civilians alike - tracked by drones and sensors, personal direct text messages being monitored and the exploration and destruction of the Hamas tunnel network, Israeli defence companies have continued to exhibit at major arms shows and sell their technology.\n\n\"Israel has spent the past six months testing and showing huge amounts of new weapons: drones, quadcopters, surveillance tech and various other equipment in Gaza,\" says Loewenstein. \"It's too early to know exactly who's buying that equipment. We do know, in the past six months, for example, that Israel has had a large presence at arms fairs.\"\n\nStocks soar\n\nAlthough some technology failed on October 7, the incursion was mostly seen as a governmental and intelligence failure to which the answer might be more gear.\n\n\"The companies that have deployed the technology and other surveillance tech on the border that failed haven't taken a step back. If anything, they've simply, very clinically, said, 'Let's not look at the past. Let's focus on the fact that we are now the saviours of Israel.' In other words, 'You need us to protect Israel.\"'\n\nThe main publicly listed Israeli defence companies - IAI, Elbit, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems - have done record business since the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago and their stock prices have generally performed strongly this year.\n\nGlobal interest\n\nLife for Loewenstein has become more intense, as it has for many Jews in the diaspora, as well as in Israel. His book was somehow even more relevant and people worldwide wanted to know more about the failure of Israeli intelligence represented by the October 7 massacre and the implications of the devastating response.\n\n\"It's been very, very difficult. My book came out before October 7 and was doing pretty well. I got a lot of attention. Then October 7 happened and it's just exploded in ways that I could never have imagined. I wake up every day to interview requests from every corner of the globe.\"\n\nThe Sydney-based Loewenstein was already no stranger to attacks from fellow Jews and come-what-may backers of Israel. His journalism has been highly critical of the Israeli state and what he sees as decades of repression of Palestinians. His 2007 book, My Israel Question, was a searing indictment of Zionism and his rejection of it as a Jew.\n\nHe says Israel is profiting financially and in regional and global influence by demonstrating its military effectiveness and the depth of its monitoring capabilities. Far from failing on October 7 - a failing that may land on the military and not its equipment - Israel is exploiting the power of its weaponry deployed in Gaza.\n\nArab states that signed the so-called Abraham Accords (United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco) to normalise relations with Israel under the Trump administration have stuck with the relationship, as has Saudi Arabia, which had been close to establishing normal relations before October 7.\n\nIn each case, the authoritarian regimes may pay lip service to suppressed domestic protests against the Israeli destruction of Gaza, but in the end, Loewenstein believes, their political elites want access to Israel and its technology.\n\n\"None of them have cut ties and none of them will. I'm talking about the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Bahrainis, the list goes on. They know their people, in general, are very against what Israel is doing. And, to some extent, they have to show deference to that anger.\n\n\"But ultimately, I would argue that these nations are increasingly fearful of their own people for a range of reasons of which Palestine is one among many. They feel like they need the most sophisticated, repressive technology that they're buying from Israel to control their own people.\"\n\nLoewenstein expresses gloom about the outlook for Palestinians and for Israel, a country he sees as in the grip of a right wing that dehumanises Palestinians. Israel, he says, has no intention of bowing to what he sees as illusory and performative demands for a two-state solution - one which all who talk about it cynically know will never happen.\n\nIsrael radicalised\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be personally unpopular, but his policies and the right-wing elements in his coalition are popular, especially after October 7. Loewenstein says Israel is increasingly on a course that assumes Israeli ethnic superiority. Its uncompromising stance combines with extreme ideas of the end of days on the religious right to create sometimes odd bedfellows on the hard right of populist politics worldwide, especially given the history of the Holocaust.\n\n\"There is a major constituency in Israel for an ongoing war for endless occupation. Israeli society has been radicalised very strongly for years. October 7 has certainly made that even stronger.\"\n\nThe hideous bragging videos of atrocities and the dehumanisation of Palestinians posted by Israeli soldiers involve \"not just a few bad apples,\" he says. \"No. A massive amount of Israeli soldiers in cars are filming themselves on TikTok dehumanising Palestinians and this is not a handful of soldiers. This is ubiquitous.\"\n\nDuring our Zoom conversation, Loewenstein made a striking observation that put the scale of the destruction in Gaza into a historical context - one which should have been obvious but was somehow lost in the immediacy of the conflict: this war has displaced hundreds of thousands more people than the expulsion (or withdrawal, depending on who is telling the story) of Palestinians in 1948. The UN estimates 1.7 million people have been displaced in Gaza. In 1948, about 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled the region.\n\nKnown to Palestinians as the Nakba or Catastrophe, it is the origin of the occupation of the West Bank, the creation of an isolated Gaza Strip, and the status of Palestinians as refugees in camps created in that era, many of which are still there 75 years later. It's a scary calculus when you think how long the effects of the war against Hamas may last. \"What's happening now is on a scale far bigger than 1948. There's more displacement. And the killing was not even close to where we are now,\" he says of the more than 33,000 people reported killed in Gaza.\n\n\"We all know that this is going to take literally decades to rebuild.\"\n\nHe expects a generational explosion of anti-Israel and anti-Western sentiment across the Arab world.\n\nSlow dawning\n\nWith most domestic media in Israel reporting a strongly Israeli perspective on the conflict, and with social media tending to channel discussion into pre-existing camps, Loewenstein sees no sign that the Israeli public recognise the scale of the Gaza crisis or the likelihood they will live with its consequences for decades to come.\n\nNetanyahu may be the bogeyman, but he represents, or is in cahoots with, a large and robust portion of Israelis and certainly of Israeli hard-right politicians. He continues to face corruption charges, but he may well be replaced by someone just as hardline. Settlers continue to expand territory in the West Bank and even propose going to Gaza.\n\n\"It's fair to say that it's hard not to be even more despairing now than I would have been when we spoke [last July],\" Loewenstein says. \"Things are so grim. The only silver lining, in a way, is that there are growing numbers of young Jews who have been at the forefront of opposition to what's going on, mostly in the US, UK, Jewish Voice for Peace [for example]. They're a minority, but they're a growing minority.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "its@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "its", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tech@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "tech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/QR262UV6TZEEJCGA7CGIADA27E.jpg?auth=680a535794b5c19f590d567f5dca29d9a862b8e9a2a225abbac2cbeaf78ce3fd&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "eventUri": "eng-9515473", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 452043809, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b8e"}

and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) signalling that it will not cut interest rates soon, the Malaysian economy is unfazed and appears to be on track to grow between 4% and 5% this year in line with official estimates.\n\nMost economists expect the gross domestic product (GDP) growth projection by Bank Negara to be in sync with their forecasts, but said they were awaiting for the introduction of the planned fuel subsidy rationlisation to gauge how it would affect consumption.\n\nFurthermore, the timing of the Fed funds rate cuts could also have some impact on the domestic economy, they noted.\n\nThe recent advance estimate showed that the domestic economy grew by 3.9% in the first quarter of 2024 (1Q24) from 3% in 4Q23, backed by steady domestic demand and a rebound in external demand.\n\nMARC Ratings Bhd chief economist Ray Choy told StarBiz it is still possible for the economy to grow between 4% and 5% this year, adding that he is maintaining his forecast for 2024 at 4.2%.\n\nMARC Ratings Bhd chief economist Ray Choy\n\nHe said the advance estimate of 1Q24 GDP growth stood at 3.9%, accompanied by a turnaround in export growth which reached 2.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) for the quarter, which is a vast improvement from a minus 6.9% in 4Q23, signalling an improving external environment.\n\n\"This improvement is further supported by the global semiconductor upcycle, showing an increase of 14.9% y-o-y in revenues for the first two months of the year.\n\nAdditionally, the resilient growth of Malaysia's trade partners such as the United States and signs of a recovering China provides support to external demand.\n\n\"Other regional peers with an improving growth trajectory include India and Japan,\" he said.\n\nChoy felt the escalation in geopolitical risks in the Middle East at the moment is also limited, as the recent actions by Iran and Israel suggest an avoidance of a wider conflict.\n\nRAM Rating Services Bhd senior economist Woon Khai Jhek reckons Malaysia's GDP growth is still poised to rise higher for this year.\n\nHe said notwithstanding the underwhelming economic growth performance of 3.7% in 2023, the rating agency believes there is an upside lift for the economy and has maintained its GDP growth forecast for 2024 at 4.5% to 5.5%, slightly higher than Bank Negara's estimates of 4% to 5%.\n\nAlthough there are still some lingering and prevailing headwinds this year, he sees budding signs of recovery.\n\nThe recently released advance estimates by the Statistics Department for Malaysia's GDP indicated that economic growth accelerated to 3.9% in 1Q24 from 3% in 4Q23, underlined by steady domestic demand and a rebound in external demand, he noted.\n\nThe services sector is estimated to have expanded by 4.4% in 1Q24, inching up from 4.2% in 4Q23, primarily supported by the wholesale and retail trade sub-sector.\n\nFurthermore, he said the manufacturing sector which took a beating last year amid a slowdown in global demand and tech downcycle is also showing signs of recovery.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is estimated to have rebounded to 1.9% in 1Q24 after contracting by 0.1% and 0.3% respectively in 3Q23 and 4Q23.\n\n\"We expect that exports and the manufacturing sector will continue to boost the country's GDP growth throughout the rest of this year, as global trade continues to improve.\n\n\"The chance of a 'soft landing' appears to be higher for the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) upping its 2024 global growth forecast for the second consecutive quarter to 3.2% (plus 0.1 percentage-points from the previous forecast) this month.\n\n\"Coupled with the predicted upcycle in trade and semiconductors, we may be seeing early signs of a turnaround in global trade,\" Woon said.\n\nIn the World Trade Organisation's latest Global Trade Outlook and Statistics report released earlier this month, the international body forecasts global merchandise trade growth to recover to 2.6% this year after contracting 1.2% last year.\n\nOn the other hand, he anticipates domestic demand would continue to be a significant driver of the nation's GDP growth in 2024.\n\nThis would be supported by a robust job market and supportive financial conditions, he said.\n\nFurthermore, Woon said private consumption growth last year was weighed down by high base effects from 2022, elevated price pressures and the lapse of large policy support (e.g. Covid-19 related financial assistance and Employees Provident Fund (EPF) withdrawal schemes).\n\nAs these pressures dissipate, he said private consumption growth should also trend higher this year. To some extent, further recovery in the tourism sector may also contribute to some upside to domestic consumption and services activities, he noted.\n\nExpressing his optimism on the local economy, Bank Muamalat (M) Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid, who is forecasting a GDP growth of 4.3% this year, said Bank Negara's growth target of 4% to 5% in 2024 is within reach.He said the stable environment in the labour market, cash transfers programme, the implementation of infrastructure projects along with the turnaround in external demand are the key drivers for this year's economic growth. He said the latest move by the EPF to allow for flexible withdrawal from Account 3 could also be an important catalyst for growth as the tendencies to spend among Malaysians are quite high.\n\nOCBC Bank senior Asean economist Lavanya Venkateswaran said she is still holding on to the 4.2% y-o-y GDP forecast, noting that this based on the view the global electronics export down cycle would bottom by the first held of this year, government infrastructure focussed spending would continue, and the private consumption would stabilise.\n\n\"If the increase in global oil prices extends to other commodities such as palm oil, rubber and liquefied natural gas, it could add to tailwinds for export growth. However, if the price increases are restricted to global oil prices, the impact is less clear cut. We see limited improvements to export growth, with subsidy spending picking up. This may motivate us to press ahead with targeted fuel subsidy rationalisation,\" she said.\n\nHowever, UCSI University Malaysia associate professor of finance Liew Chee Yoong is not too upbeat on the economy. \"I don't think the local economy will continue to grow between 4% to 5% this year. There is a high risk that the conflict in the Middle East will become a larger conflict and this could occur anytime.\n\n\"If this occurs, the price of crude oil is likely to exceed US$100 per barrel resulting in drastic increase in global inflation and the risk of global stagflation. On top of that, Malaysia have to be prepared for other possible external macroeconomic shocks as well resulting from the possible invasion of China on Taiwan, the possibility of a military conflict between China and the United States in the South China Sea, the possible widening of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a possible new and sudden terrorist attack similar to 9/11, etc,\" he said.\n\nLiew, who is also a research fellow at the Centre for Market Education, said his GDP growth forecast is between 1% and 3% this year, which is relatively similar with the IMF's global economic growth prediction for this year.\n\nHe said other indicators to watch that may impact the local economy include global oil prices, particularly relevant due to the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. \"Additionally, trade tensions between major economies and changes in global supply chains could also influence Malaysia's export-oriented sectors.\n\n\"It is essential for the government to monitor these global economic dynamics closely as they will play crucial roles in determining the actual economic growth and currency strength of Malaysia in 2024,\" Liew said.\n\nOCBC's Venkateswaran said the bank is awaiting the announcement regarding the targeted fuel subsidies to gauge its impact on economy, adding that its house view is for the ringgit to trade at RM4.66 against the greenback by year-end, and with its end-2Q24 forecast at RM4.74.\n\nMARC's Choy said the planned subsidy rationalisation may weaken consumption due to a higher cost of living, although this may be mitigated by consumers reallocating how money is being spent within their personal budgets, leading to a limited net effect.\n\nHe expects the ringgit to improve to the range of RM4.4 to RM4.7 against the US dollar towards the second half, supported by US rate cuts, the implementation of Malaysia's structural reforms as well as a higher current account surplus caused by higher oil prices and exports.\n\nDownside risks on the ringgit would stem from the increased likelihood of fewer Fed rate cuts in 2024, which he said may result in a persistently wider interest rate differential compared to the United States, potentially leading to more outflows of foreign funds from the local market.\n\nOn the local currency, Afzanizam said: \"We are of the view that the US interest rates could be cut sometime in the 4Q24. \"Our sense is that the Fed has been reducing their balance sheet size from as high as US$.97 trillion in April 2022 to currently at US$7.41 trillion as of April this year.\n\n\"That's a US$1.56 trillion reduction in Fed's assets which are predominantly held in the form of US Treasury notes and bonds. Our estimates indicate that the quantitative tightening could end sometime September or October this year.\n\n\"Should the inflation continue to moderate and signs of economic weaknesses become more prevalent, we shall see the Fed start to cut the interest rate by then. That's our baseline narrative. On that note, the ringgit should appreciate towards the later part of 2024. We are projecting that the US dollar-ringgit exchange rate could end the year at RM4.65.\"\n\nMeanwhile, RAM's Woon said the timing of interest rate cuts in the United States remains one of the key risks on the horizon. The potential market volatility and ringgit weakness could introduce more widespread imported price pressures if prolonged, he said.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/04/29/2666933.png", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 452043696, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b8f"}

Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes.\n\nChina's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to \"the relevant authorities\".\n\nThe People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nSANCTIONS WARNING\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed \"serious concern\" that Beijing was \"powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine\".\n\nStill, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping, was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.\n\nWhile officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the U.S. preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a U.S. official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, \"China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, \"Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security.\n\n\"Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBlinken made clear to Chinese officials \"that ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest,\" the spokesperson said. \"If China does not address this problem, the United States will.\"\n\nNearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.\n\nSome of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion.\n\nAmong the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.\n\nBy contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit.

The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.\"\n\nWang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.\n\n\"I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,\" he said.\n\n\"What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future.

Hundreds of students are being arrested in universities across the United States. In Spain, hundreds of thousands have protested since the beginning of the war, while in Sanaa, Yemen, over a million people gathered last week to protest the US-backed genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe pseudo-left Revolutionary Left (IR) group, the former Spanish affiliate of both the International Marxist Tendency (IMT) and the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI), is suddenly trying to distance itself from PSOE-Sumar government, and its main ally in parliament, Podemos. All these parties are accomplices in the Israeli genocide against the Palestinians.\n\nUnder first the PSOE-Podemos government (2020-2023), and now the PSOE-Sumar government, IR backed these parties of capitalist government and worked to block working class opposition on their left. Both governments increased trade, military, and economic relations with the Zionist regime, particularly in arms. Under PSOE-Podemos, Spain sold weapons to Israel worth hundreds of millions of euros while Madrid spent millions buying weapons with the \"combat-tested\" mark. The PSOE-Sumar government kept buying and selling millions of euros worth of weaponry from Israel.\n\nIR is now attempting to distance itself from these parties, to hide its support for parties complicit in the genocide. In \"PSOE-Sumar, the NATO Government and the militarism,\" IR states:\n\n[W]e cannot place any trust in a government that has demonstrated ad nauseam that it operates for the interests of the capitalists and follows the directives of imperialist masters in Washington. Likewise, other political forces, such as [Podemos], which no longer bear governmental responsibilities but center their entire strategy on institutional action, do not present a viable alternative. Many of the aggressive measures mentioned were endorsed while Podemos held ministerial positions, and their current critique, devoid of any assumption of responsibility, only exacerbates their credibility crisis.\n\nMilitarism is an organic feature of social democracy. Historically, they have consistently acquiesced to the ruling class, and this tendency persists in their current bellicose stance in Ukraine, their NATO alignment, and their complicity with the Zionist genocide. This leftist faction does not constitute part of the solution but rather contributes to the problem.\n\nIR is running from Podemos like rats fleeing from a sinking ship. IR knows Podemos and Sumar's support is plummeting to all-time lows. In the regional elections held this year in Galicia and the Basque Country, Podemos failed to win any seats. Eight years before, Podemos was the most voted party in the Basque Country. The polls are equally dire for the upcoming European elections, where Podemos is expected to receive 2.3 percent of the vote, down from 10 percent in 2019.\n\nSumar, a split-off from Podemos ruling with the PSOE at national level, is also collapsing. It did not obtain any lawmakers in Galicia and only one seat in the Basque Country. It is polling at 2.9 percent in European elections.\n\nThe crisis of the main \"Left Populist\" parties of bourgeois rule in Spain is exposing IR's own bankruptcy. Over the past decade, IR has been one of the greatest cheerleaders of Podemos and its participation in a PSOE-led government. In 2019, when Podemos entered into government, IR wrote that this \"represents an event of historical significance which has raised enormous expectations.\" Such a government,\" they said, was \"the result of the great mass mobilization that has shaken the Spanish State.\"\n\nDespite Podemos' flagrantly right-wing policies -- raising the military budget, slashing pensions and wages, providing billions of euros in corporate bailouts and pursuing a profits-over-lives policy in the COVID-19 pandemic that cost over 140,000 lives -- IR kept working as a de facto faction of Podemos.\n\nIR threw all its strength into supporting the leader and founder of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, in the Madrid regional elections in 2021. It called for a Podemos vote with posters larger than those of the pseudo-left party itself. They boasted of hanging 11,000 posters and distributing more than 121,000 pamphlets backing Iglesias.\n\nOver the next years, the PSOE-Podemos government escalated its war at home and abroad. It provided hundreds of millions in weaponry to the far-right Ukrainian regime in the NATO war against Russia, massacred refugees on Spain's borders, imposed minimum service requirements on air crews, and attacked striking truck drivers and metal workers. All the while, it intensified its support for the far-right Netanyahu government, despite it brutal occupation of Gaza that led to the October 7 uprising against Israel.\n\nNonetheless, IR once again called the \"left\" to rally behind the PSOE-Sumar government after last year's elections. In November 2023, the PSOE and Sumar formed a new coalition government, without Podemos. Soon after, IR posted an article titled \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez supports his investiture: a Government for social peace and collaboration with imperialism.\" While admitting the reactionary character of the PSOE-Sumar government, IR continued:\n\n\"Despite everything, the constitution of a PSOE-Sumar Government appears in the eyes of a large majority of our class as a million times preferable to a PP-Vox Government. From Revolutionary Left we perfectly understand this opinion. Of course, it would be profoundly wrong for the left-wing forces with parliamentary representation to deny their critical support for S\u00e1nchez's investiture!\"\n\nSoon after, IR welcomed Podemos' exit from government as many of its voters joined pro-Palestinian protests. The largest and most sustained anti-war movement since the Vietnam War era was erupting around the world, with millions participating in protests. IR stated \"From Revolutionary Left we welcome this decision, and we say that it has to be the beginning of a real break with the social democratic policies of that left that has become an essential prop of capitalist rule...\"\n\nPodemos left government not because it opposed the genocide in Gaza, austerity or militarism, all of which it supported from 2020 to 2023. To make clear its continuing support for the PSOE and Sumar, Podemos leader Ione Belarra declared that \"the democratic forces [Podemos, PSOE and Sumar] must work together\" against the far-right.\n\nIR now is following the exact same path. It is distancing itself from Podemos, the same way Podemos took distance from the PSOE-Sumar government. However, it aims not to mobilize working class opposition to the PSOE-Sumar government, but to guard the left flank of the pseudo-left parties tasked with defending the strategic interests of Spanish imperialism.\n\nIR is promoting regionalist and nationalist forces that defend the PSOE-Sumar government in parliament. For the Galician elections, it called for a vote to the Nationalist Galician Bloc (BNG), stating: \"It would be very important to strengthen street action and demand from day one that a BNG-PSOE Government fulfills its promises.\" In the Basque country it called to vote for the Basque-nationalist EH Bildu party, arguing, \"we are not abstentionists, and that is why we ask for a critical vote for EH Bildu.\"\n\nBoth parties have supported the PSOE-Podemos and the PSOE-Sumar governments in hiking military expenditure to record levels and turning Spain into a spearhead of NATO against Russia in Ukraine.\n\nIR justifies its support for these parties under the idea that \"Revolutionary communists, Leninists, have never championed abstentionism\" in elections. This is a shameless and miserable charade. IR has never been a Marxist organization. This organization traces its roots back to a British-based group led by Ted Grant that broke with Trotskyism and split from the Fourth International in the late 1940s.\n\nThe Grant group subsequently became among the most vociferous promoters of Pabloism, which the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was formed to fight in 1953. Adapting to the post-Second World War social order, the Pabloites wrote off the working class as an independent revolutionary force. They argued that the Stalinist bureaucracy, bourgeois nationalist movements in the colonial countries, and the union and social-democratic bureaucracies would be transformed under mass pressure into revolutionary organizations.\n\nGrant and his followers developed \"entryism\" as a permanent strategic orientation. They aimed not at politically educating workers through a struggle against the pro-capitalist bureaucracies, but to keep radicalized workers within the confines of the Labour Party and trade union bureaucracies.\n\nIn Spain, IR demanded that workers and youth should subordinate themselves to the PSOE in the 1980s, then the Stalinist-led United Left and then Podemos since 2014. Now, faced with the growing collapse of Podemos, IR is searching for new tools to prop up the discredited PSOE-Sumar government.\n\nMobilizing the working class to halt the genocide requires breaking with the nationalist outlook of pseudo-left groups that subordinate workers to the Spanish capitalist state. Only an international, independent movement of the working class can halt arms deliveries to Israel, stop repression of protests, and end the wars. The political basis of such a movement is the International Committee of the Fourth International's struggle to expose pseudo-left tendencies such as IR and build sections of the ICFI in Spain and internationally as the revolutionary leadership of the working class.\n\nRead moreSpain's Podemos politically complicit in the genocide of Palestinians15 March 2024Podemos electoral debacle in Spain exposes bankruptcy of Revolutionary Left (IR) group22 June 2023Spain's pseudo-left Revolutionary Left promotes M\u00e9lenchon in France, Podemos government at home24 May 2023Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:SpainThe Politics of the Pseudo-LeftStop Israel's genocide in Gaza!Europe", "source": {"uri": "wsws.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Socialist"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.wsws.org/asset/85fd71dc-feed-499c-a233-8b8fb336c260?rendition=1600x900", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 452043174, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b93"}

He's depressed.\n\n\"He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He purposely drove off.\"\n\nDharmesh Patel, who remains in jail, has now pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder in a California court and is seeking mental health diversion, which would see him released, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nA two-year treatment plan would follow and he would escape charges if he did not commit any further crimes or breach his conditions during that time.\n\nPatel's defence team called Dr Mark Patterson to testify to their client's state of mind.\n\nPatterson told the court Patel was suffering a psychotic break and believed he was acting to protect his family, the Daily Mail reported.\n\n\"It was paranoid and kind of delusional thinking that he acted on at the time to protect his family from a worse fate,\" Patterson said.\n\n\"He was concerned that his children were at risk of being kidnapped, possibly for sexual molestation. ... There were concerns surrounding the explosion of fentanyl in this country and the war in Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said he had diagnosed Patel with major depressive disorder and said his delusions had ceased while he was held behind bars.\n\n\"He still feels a lot of remorse,\" Patterson said.\n\nProsecutors argued against diversion in the case, saying that Patel was instead suffering from schizoaffective disorder, casting doubts on the efficacy of the defence's proposed treatment plan.\n\nDistrict Attorney Stephen Wagstaffe expressed concern that, under the plan, Patel will not be monitored except in his meetings with doctors.\n\n\"If he goes off his medication, how do you know?

At the same time, other firefighters watching the sedan through binoculars suddenly noticed movement -- a sign that at least one person was still alive.\n\n\"Every one of us was shocked when we saw movement out of the front windshield,\" Pottenger said.\n\nThe incident turned from what had been likely a recovery of bodies to a rescue operation that took several hours amid constant rain, heavy winds, slick roads and crashing waves. The doors were smashed against the cliff and jammed shut, so firefighters were forced to cut the victims out of the car using the so-called \"jaws of life\" tools.\n\nCrews pulled the children out of the back window and brought them up the cliff by hand in a rescue basket using the rope system.

While he's indicated a preference to proceed gradually with rate increases, Ueda is trying to avoid restraining the economy.\n\nThat's becoming even more challenging after US data this week indicated inflation accelerated in the first quarter, reinforcing expectations the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nHere are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy, geopolitics and markets:\n\nWorld\n\nOutside the BOJ, Paraguay, Turkey, Russia and Guatemala held rates steady. Hungary further slowed the pace of cuts. Indonesia defied expectations and boosted rates, while Ukraine lowered them. Argentina cut its key interest rate for the fourth time since President Javier Milei took office in December as officials bet on a sustained slowdown in inflation.\n\nBeijing's vast claims across the South China Sea -- based on a vague 1947 map showing what's become known as a \"ten-dash line\" through the waterway -- were rejected by a United Nations-backed tribunal in 2016. But President Xi Jinping dismissed the ruling, and ever-growing tensions in the disputed waters all point to an uncomfortable truth for Southeast Asian nations, as well as the US: In this standoff, China is winning. China's increasingly assertive stance has sparked a flurry of diplomatic and military efforts aimed at countering Beijing's footprint.\n\nAsia\n\nThe BOJ kept the range for its benchmark rate between 0% and 0.1% as widely expected by economists at the conclusion of its meeting, according to a pared-back statement with only a few lines. The central bank didn't signal a reduction of its bond purchases, saying instead it would buy them in line with its March decision.\n\nSouth Korea's exports have made a brisk start to the second quarter based on early trade figures for April, brightening the outlook for economic growth. The value of shipments increased 11.1% from a year earlier in the first 20 days of April.\n\nHigher inflationary expectations and price tolerance are taking root in Japan, a development that supports the central bank's moves to normalize policy and raise interest rates further. A recent survey by Tsutomu Watanabe, a leading inflation expert in the nation, found that Japanese consumers' tolerance of price changes is holding up and is higher than levels seen among shoppers in some other major economies.\n\nUS\n\nThe surprisingly sharp downshift in US economic growth last quarter masked otherwise resilient household demand and business investment that helped generate faster inflation. While the 1.6% advance in gross domestic product missed all economists' projections, so-called final sales to private domestic purchasers -- which strips out inventories, trade and government spending -- rose at a 3.1% rate after adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of underlying US inflation rose at a brisk pace in March, reinforcing concerns of persistent price pressures that are likely to delay any interest-rate cuts. Traders mostly reacted positively as investors took relief from in-line monthly inflation data after quarterly figures on Thursday suggested upside risk to March.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's recent polling bump in key battleground states has mostly evaporated as a deep current of pessimism about the trajectory of the US economy hurts his standing with voters. Biden trails the presumptive GOP nominee slightly in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and his deficit in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina is larger.\n\nEurope\n\nEuro-area private-sector activity advanced to the highest level in almost a year, driven by a buoyant services sector and Germany's return to growth.\n\nEmerging Markets\n\nSingapore's core inflation eased in March on lower food prices and costs of services, with the disinflationary trend expected to continue barring any supply shocks from geopolitical tensions.\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Charting-the-global-economy-BOJ-holds-US-inflation-wont-let.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 452043053, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b95"}

Is Preparing Arrest Warrants Over War", "body": "Israeli officials increasingly believe that the International Criminal Court is preparing to issue arrest warrants for senior government officials on charges related to the conflict with Hamas, according to five Israeli and foreign officials.\n\nThe Israeli and foreign officials also believe the court is weighing arrest warrants for leaders from Hamas.\n\nIf the court proceeds, the Israeli officials could potentially be accused of preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and pursuing an excessively harsh response to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, according to two of the five officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.\n\nThe Israeli officials, who are worried about the potential fallout from such a case, said they believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is among those who might be named in a warrant. It is not clear who might be charged from Hamas or what crimes would be cited.\n\nArrest warrants from the court would probably be seen in much of the world as a humbling moral rebuke, particularly to Israel, which for months has faced international backlash over its conduct in Gaza, including from President Biden, who called it \"over the top.\"\n\nIt could also affect Israel's policies as the country presses its military campaign against Hamas. One of the Israeli officials said that the possibility of the court issuing arrest warrants had informed Israeli decision-making in recent weeks.\n\nThe Israeli and foreign officials said they didn't know what stage the process was in. Any warrants would require approval from a panel of judges and would not necessarily result in a trial or even the targets' immediate arrest.\n\nKarim Khan, the court's chief prosecutor, has previously confirmed that his team is investigating incidents during the war, but his office declined to comment for this article, saying that it does not \"respond to speculation in media reports.\"\n\nWhat you should know. The Times makes a careful decision any time it uses an anonymous source. The information the source supplies must be newsworthy and give readers genuine insight.\n\nLearn more about our process.\n\nMr. Netanyahu did not explain what prompted his statement, though he may have been responding to speculation about the arrest warrants in the Israeli press.\n\nHe also said: \"Under my leadership, Israel will never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent right of self-defense. The threat to seize the soldiers and officials of the Middle East's only democracy and the world's only Jewish state is outrageous. We will not bow to it.\"\n\nBased in The Hague, the I.C.C. is the world's only permanent international court with the power to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force of its own. Instead, it relies on its 124 members, which include most European countries but not Israel or the United States, to arrest those named in warrants. It cannot try defendants in absentia.\n\nThe Hamas-led raid last October led to the killing of roughly 1,200 people in Israel and the abductions of some 250 others, according to Israeli officials. The subsequent war in Gaza, including heavy Israeli bombardment, has killed more than 34,000 people, according to Gazan officials, caused widespread damage to housing and infrastructure, and brought the territory to the brink of famine.\n\nThe Israeli assault in Gaza has led the International Court of Justice, a separate court in The Hague, to hear accusations of genocide against the Israeli state and has spurred a wave of protests on college campuses in the United States.\n\nIf the I.C.C. does issue arrest warrants, they would come with deep stigmatization, placing those named in them in the same category as foreign leaders like Omar al-Bashir, the deposed president of Sudan, and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, who was the subject of a warrant last year tied to his war against Ukraine.\n\nThe I.C.C.'s focus on individuals rather than states differentiates it from the International Court of Justice, which settles disputes between states.\n\nMr. Khan has declared that his team believes it has the jurisdiction to investigate episodes that have occurred since Oct. 7 and said that he would be \"impartially looking at the evidence and vindicating the rights of victims whether they are in Israel or Palestine.\"\n\nHamas and the Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment.

He has been less a leader and more a human weathervane who shifts daily with the political winds. Everything is driven by ulterior political motives to court popularity and to win reelection -- even setting aside a seat on the United States Supreme Court for a Black woman insinuating the appointment was not based on merit.\n\nBut Mr. Biden exhibits admirable redeeming features. His entire life has been devoted to public service. His personal and family hardships have been overwhelming. He eschews the narcissism and pomposity that marks political figures. He resisted exploiting the Super Bowl to advance his reelection chances. He has not, however, avoided the ravages of time. At age 81, Mr. Biden is at risk of aging 10 years in one.\n\nMr. Biden's constitutional insincerity is pronounced. As senator, he vowed to champion the impeachment of President George W. Bush if he attacked Iran without a congressional declaration of war as required by Article I, section 8, clause 11. But as president, Mr. Biden has claimed the power to initiate war on his say-so alone, whether against China, Russia, Iran, the Houthis, or otherwise. To borrow from Shakespeare, upon what meat doth this our President feed that he has grown so great?\n\nPresident Biden's habitual market interventions are ill-conceived, for example, the billions expended to promote semiconductor chip production. He has forgotten Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations,\" which was gospel to the Founding Fathers:\n\n\"What is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every individual, it is evident, can, in his local situation, judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him. The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.\"\n\nPresident Biden's economic follies can be understood. He is a professional politician who has never met a payroll and is clueless about free market incentives. He cannot make the waves go back.\n\nBiden is at least semi-senescent. He looks mummified. He is 81 years old and anemic. Special Counsel Robert K. Hur recently remarked on Biden's serial memory lapses. His grip on reality lessens by the day.\n\nBiden on immigration has been a fiasco. It has even led to the impeachment of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas. Illegal immigration has spiked to alarming levels. Some studies show immigrants are more likely to commit serious crimes than citizens. Others show immigrants are an economic deadweight, not an economic asset. And still others show the government spends more per capita on illegal migrants than on citizens. Finally, a porous border invites terrorists like members of Hezbollah to infiltrate and perpetrate a bloody sequel to 9/11. President Biden is rolling dice with our lives.\n\nImmigrants have invaded the country sans Molotov cocktails and AK-47s. States have a right to fight back in self-defense. At least half the States support Texas's endeavor to police the border without regard to the U.S. Border Patrol. A second civil war may be approaching.\n\nThe U.S. has contributed over $75 billion to Ukraine's war effort against Russia with no light at the end of the tunnel. Mr. Biden is clueless about what \"victory\" should look like. His ulterior motive is to overthrow Russian President Vladimir Putin. But what then? There are no George Washingtons, Thomas Jeffersons, James Madisons, or John Adamses in Russia. There never has been. There never will be. True or false, Russians believe they need a dictator to avoid incessant intramural strife and conflict. Biden is making the American people pay for his fool's errand in Ukraine. Its fate is irrelevant to the national security of the United States. If it were otherwise, President Biden would have asked Congress for a declaration of war against Russia.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is a wild card. He could attract voters from Biden to hand victory to Trump.\n\nThe United States' ill-executed withdrawal from Afghanistan after squandering more than $300 million every day for 20 successive years of failure enabled the Taliban's return to power and capture of American weapons. But no one has paid a political price for this stupendous, criminal blunder that returned a second edition of Taliban grislier than the first.\n\nWhat about Hunter Biden, including the infamous laptop which 51 former intelligence officials falsely and recklessly disparaged as \"Russian disinformation?\" Add to that the tax fraud and firearm charges and notorious influence peddling. Americans are asking, \"are we seeing a dual system of justice at work?\"", "source": {"uri": "thyblackman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThyBlackMan"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://thyblackman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Republicans-For-Democrat-Joe-Biden.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 452042853, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657b98"}

Reuters could not determine the extent of transactions that had shifted from major banks to more obscure routes.\n\nChina's foreign ministry is not aware of the practices described by the businesspeople to arrange payments or troubles in settling payments through major Chinese banks, a spokesperson said, referring questions to \"the relevant authorities\".\n\nThe People's Bank of China and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the country's banking sector regulator, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, after meeting China's top diplomat Wang Yi for five and a half hours in Beijing on Friday, said he had expressed \"serious concern\" that Beijing was \"powering Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine\".\n\nStill, his visit, which included meeting President Xi Jinping, was the latest in a series of steps that have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations between the world's biggest economies to historic lows last year.\n\nWhile officials have warned that the United States was ready to take action against Chinese financial institutions facilitating trade in goods with dual civilian and military applications and the U.S. preliminarily has discussed sanctions on some Chinese banks, a U.S. official told Reuters last week Washington does not yet have a plan to implement such measures.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, \"China does not accept any illegal, unilateral sanctions. Normal trade cooperation between China and Russia is not subject to disruption by any third party.\"\n\nA State Department spokesperson, asked about Reuters findings that Chinese banks were curbing payments from Russia and the impact on some Chinese companies, said, \"Fuelling Russia's defence industrial base not only threatens Ukrainian security, it threatens European security.\n\n\"Beijing cannot achieve better relations with Europe while supporting the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBlinken made clear to Chinese officials \"that ensuring transatlantic security is a core U.S. interest,\" the spokesperson said. \"If China does not address this problem, the United States will.\"\n\nNearly all major Chinese banks have suspended settlements from Russia since the beginning of March, said a manager at a listed electronics company in Guangdong.\n\nSome of the biggest state-owned lenders have reported drops in Russia-related business, reversing a surge in assets after Russia's invasion.\n\nAmong the Big Four, China Construction Bank posted a drop of 14% in its Russian subsidiary's assets last year and Agricultural Bank of China a 7% decline, according to their latest filings.\n\nBy contrast, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , the country's biggest lender, reported a 43% jump in assets of its Russian unit. Bank of China (BOC), the fourth-largest, did not give the breakdown.\n\nThe four banks did not respond to requests for comment on their Russian businesses or the impact on Chinese companies.\n\nSome rural banks in northeast China along the Russian border can still collect payments, but this has led to a bottleneck, with some businesspeople saying they have been lining up for months to open accounts.\n\nA chemical and machinery company in Jiangsu province has been waiting for three months to open an account at Jilin Hunchun Rural Commercial Bank in the northeastern province of Jilin, said Liu, who works at the firm and also asked to be identified by family name.\n\nCalls to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.\n\nBOC has blocked a payment from Liu's Russian clients since February, and a bank loan officer said firms exporting heavy equipment face more stringent reviews in receiving payments, Liu said.\n\nThe manager at the listed Guangdong company said their firm had opened accounts at seven banks since last month but none agreed to accept payments from Russia.\n\n\"We gave up on the Russian market,\" the manager said. \"We eventually didn't receive more than 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in payments from the Russian side, and we just gave up. The process of collecting payments is extremely annoying.\"\n\nWang is also having second thoughts about his Russian business.\n\n\"I may gradually shrink my business in Russia as the slow process of collecting money is not good for the company's liquidity management,\" he said.\n\n\"What's more, you don't know what will happen in the future.

There were others outside the Ukraine context.\n\nDonbas formed into two independent republics in response to the anti-Russian coup orchestrated by the United States that overthrew the elected Ukrainian government. Putin's first strategic blunder was in permitting Washington's overthrow of the democratically elected Ukrainian government.\n\nIn 2014 after the overthrow of the Ukrainian government the two independent Donbas republics voted overwhelmingly, as did Crimea, to be reincorporated into Russia. Putin accepted Crimea's request, as otherwise Russia would lose its Black Sea naval base, but rejected the request of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics.\n\nThis was Putin's second strategic blunder. If Putin or the Kremlin or the Russian government had given equal treatment to Donetsk and Luhansk a decade ago in 2014, there would have been no limited military operation with Ukraine. Neither Ukraine, NATO, nor Washington would dared to have attacked Russian territory in order to \"recover Donbass.\"\n\nIf the US persisted in bringing Ukraine into NATO, Putin would have been forced to recognize that he was at war with the West and that he had no alternative but to reestablish Ukraine to its many centuries existence as a part of Russia. Ukraine's \"independence\" is an American creation 30 years old. Every Western analyst has overlooked, or kept silent about, the fact that the dismemberment of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union is like the dismemberment of Germany after World War I, the difference being that Hitler was determined to put Germany back together but Putin has no such ambition.

In a report published on Friday, April 26, the German NGO European Platform for Democratic Elections (EPDE) revealed the identity of 183 foreign \"international observers and experts\" who were invited by the Russian authorities to observe the March 2024 presidential election, in which Putin was elected to a fifth term. It has been described by the European Parliament as \"illegitimate and undemocratic\" and was preceded by the death of opposition figure Alexei Navalny in a Russian prison on February 16.\n\nSince the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin's regime has been inviting European elected officials and media personalities to Russia in order to legitimize violations of international law (territorial annexations) and the corruption of democratic rules (rigged elections) to the Russian public and the international community alike. The foreign figures who are invited are displayed in the Russian media as a \"democratic\" endorsement of the Kremlin's actions. At the 2018 presidential elections, French observers included former ambassador to Moscow Jean Cadet, Rassemblement National (far right) MP Gilbert Collard, Union des D\u00e9mocrates Ind\u00e9pendants (center right) senator Jo\u00ebl Gu\u00e9rriau, and Thierry Mariani, who was then a member of Les R\u00e9publicains (right).\n\nAt the same time, Russian authorities have gradually reduced their tolerance of independent, qualified observers, including those from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), of which Russia is a member. During the last presidential election, the high level of fraud (media censorship, the exclusion and repression of any genuine opposition, the careful selection of 'rival candidates,' security checks of voters right up to the polling stations, ballot box stuffing and falsification of results) led the Kremlin to organize a sham observation, while all independent observation was banned.\n\nStaging\n\nThis staging, under the aegis of Russia's Central Election Commission (CEC), entailed the invitation of 1,115 \"international observers and experts\" from 129 countries. \"We know of cases where observers were contacted by fake NGOs, by the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, and by the Federation Council,\" reported EPDE board president Stefanie Schiffer.

Pressure is building on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal that would free some Israeli hostages and bring a cease-fire in the war in Gaza. The White House says Biden reiterated his \"clear position\" as Israel plans to invade Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah despite global concern for more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering there.

Students are demanding the schools cut financial ties with Israel and hundreds of students have been arrested on campuses from coast to coast. Protesters on both sides of the issue shouted and shoved each other during demonstrations Sunday at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Like a comic honing his routine, the Democratic president has been testing and expanding his jokes over the past few weeks. It started with jabs about his Republican opponent's financial problems, and now Biden regularly jeers Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and much more.

Trump likes to cite the 99-year-old Carter as a measuring stick to belittle Biden. Trump calls Carter a happy man because, according to Trump, Biden's performance in office makes Carter's presidency look good in comparison. It was once common for Republicans to mock Carter, who lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan in 1980 amid inflation, energy shortages and the Iran hostage crisis. Trump's implication is that Biden's economy makes Carter's look better. Federal figures show today's economy is stronger and more stable than in the late 1970s. And over the years, Carter's overall presidency has gotten stronger assessments from historians.\n\nTornadoes kill 4 in Oklahoma, leaving trail of destruction and thousands without power\n\nSULPHUR, Okla.

One tornado destroyed several downtown buildings in Sulphur, Oklahoma, flipping over cars and shearing rooftops off houses across a 15-block radius. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt toured the destruction on Sunday and said every business in the town of Sulphur appeared to have been destroyed. Oklahoma's severe weather adds to the dozens of reported tornadoes that have wreaked havoc in the nation's midsection since Friday.

An official says the U.S. intelligence community has found \"no smoking gun\" that Putin was aware of the timing of Navalny's death or directly ordered it. The official says it's believed Putin was ultimately responsible for the death of Navalny, who endured brutal conditions during his confinement. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. Navalny was Russia's best-known opposition politician and died while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he called politically motivated. A month later, Putin won reelection.\n\nPassage of harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law in Iraq draws diplomatic backlash\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) -- Human rights groups and diplomat have criticized a law that was quietly passed by the Iraqi parliament over the weekend that would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people. Although homosexuality is taboo in the largely conservative Iraqi society and political leaders have periodically launched anti-LGBTQ campaigns, Iraq did not previously have a law that explicitly criminalized it. The law passed Saturday with little notice as an amendment to the country's existing anti-prostitution law, imposes a sentence of 10 to 15 years for same-sex relations and a prison term of one to three years for people who undergo or perform gender-transition surgeries and for \"intentional practice of effeminacy.\"\n\nAfrican farmers look to the past and the future to address climate change\n\nHARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- From ancient fertilizer methods in Zimbabwe to new greenhouse technology in Somalia, farmers across the heavily agriculture-reliant African continent are looking both to the past and future to respond to climate change. Africa has the world's youngest population. It is seeing the worst effects of a warming planet while contributing the least to the problem. Farmers are scrambling to make sure the booming population is fed. Some are turning to traditional foods that had been long dismissed as weeds or neglected in favor of imports. Others embrace new planting methods and varieties. One new bean's side benefit is less flatulence.\n\nObstacles remain as women seek more leadership roles in America's Black Church\n\nThroughout its long history, the Black Church in America has - for the most part - been a patriarchal institution, with men making up the vast majority of its ranks of clergy. These days, increasing numbers of Black women are attending seminary, and some women are carving out high-profile leadership roles. The African Methodist Episcopal Church says it has more than 1,000 female pastors. But obstacles remain. The founder of a group called Women of Color in Ministry estimates that less than one in 10 Black Protestant congregations are led by a woman.\n\nCandace Parker, a 3-time WNBA champion and 2-time Olympic gold medalist, announces retirement\n\nThree-time WNBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Candace Parker has announced she's retiring after 16 seasons.

We will not bow to it.\"\n\nBased in The Hague, the I.C.C. is the world's only permanent international court with the power to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force of its own. Instead, it relies on its 124 members, which include most European countries but not Israel or the United States, to arrest those named in warrants. It cannot try defendants in absentia.\n\nThe Hamas-led raid last October led to the killing of roughly 1,200 people in Israel and the abductions of some 250 others, according to Israeli officials. The subsequent war in Gaza, including heavy Israeli bombardment, has killed more than 34,000 people, according to Gazan officials, caused widespread damage to housing and infrastructure, and brought the territory to the brink of famine.\n\nThe Israeli assault in Gaza has led the International Court of Justice, a separate court in The Hague, to hear accusations of genocide against the Israeli state and has spurred a wave of protests on college campuses in the United States.\n\nIf the I.C.C. does issue arrest warrants, they would come with deep stigmatization, placing those named in them in the same category as foreign leaders like Omar al-Bashir, the deposed president of Sudan, and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, who was the subject of a warrant last year tied to his war against Ukraine.\n\nThe I.C.C.'s focus on individuals rather than states differentiates it from the International Court of Justice, which settles disputes between states.\n\nMr. Khan has declared that his team believes it has the jurisdiction to investigate episodes that have occurred since Oct. 7 and said that he would be \"impartially looking at the evidence and vindicating the rights of victims whether they are in Israel or Palestine.\"\n\nHamas and the Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment. The office of Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, declined to comment.\n\nIn general, Israeli officials say that they fight according to the laws of war and that they take significant steps to protect civilians, accusing Hamas of hiding inside civilian areas and forcing Israel to pursue them there. Hamas has denied committing atrocities on Oct. 7, saying -- despite video evidence to the contrary -- that its fighters tried to avoid harming civilians.\n\nMarlise Simons, Gabby Sobelman and Myra Noveck contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "southasiajournal.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Asia Journal"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/28/multimedia/28israel-icc-01-hgwb/28israel-icc-01-hgwb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale&w=640", "eventUri": "eng-9511740", "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 452042995, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ba1"}

He has been less a leader and more a human weathervane who shifts daily with the political winds. Everything is driven by ulterior political motives to court popularity and to win reelection -- even setting aside a seat on the United States Supreme Court for a Black woman insinuating the appointment was not based on merit.\n\nBut Mr. Biden exhibits admirable redeeming features. His entire life has been devoted to public service. His personal and family hardships have been overwhelming. He eschews the narcissism and pomposity that marks political figures. He resisted exploiting the Super Bowl to advance his reelection chances. He has not, however, avoided the ravages of time. At age 81, Mr. Biden is at risk of aging 10 years in one.\n\nMr. Biden's constitutional insincerity is pronounced. As senator, he vowed to champion the impeachment of President George W. Bush if he attacked Iran without a congressional declaration of war as required by Article I, section 8, clause 11. But as president, Mr. Biden has claimed the power to initiate war on his say-so alone, whether against China, Russia, Iran, the Houthis, or otherwise. To borrow from Shakespeare, upon what meat doth this our President feed that he has grown so great?\n\nPresident Biden's habitual market interventions are ill-conceived, for example, the billions expended to promote semiconductor chip production. He has forgotten Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations,\" which was gospel to the Founding Fathers:\n\n\"What is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value, every individual, it is evident, can, in his local situation, judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him. The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention, but assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever, and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it.\"\n\nPresident Biden's economic follies can be understood. He is a professional politician who has never met a payroll and is clueless about free market incentives. He cannot make the waves go back.\n\nBiden is at least semi-senescent. He looks mummified. He is 81 years old and anemic. Special Counsel Robert K. Hur recently remarked on Biden's serial memory lapses. His grip on reality lessens by the day.\n\nBiden on immigration has been a fiasco. It has even led to the impeachment of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas. Illegal immigration has spiked to alarming levels. Some studies show immigrants are more likely to commit serious crimes than citizens. Others show immigrants are an economic deadweight, not an economic asset. And still others show the government spends more per capita on illegal migrants than on citizens. Finally, a porous border invites terrorists like members of Hezbollah to infiltrate and perpetrate a bloody sequel to 9/11. President Biden is rolling dice with our lives.\n\nImmigrants have invaded the country sans Molotov cocktails and AK-47s. States have a right to fight back in self-defense. At least half the States support Texas's endeavor to police the border without regard to the U.S. Border Patrol. A second civil war may be approaching.\n\nThe U.S. has contributed over $75 billion to Ukraine's war effort against Russia with no light at the end of the tunnel. Mr. Biden is clueless about what \"victory\" should look like. His ulterior motive is to overthrow Russian President Vladimir Putin. But what then? There are no George Washingtons, Thomas Jeffersons, James Madisons, or John Adamses in Russia. There never has been. There never will be. True or false, Russians believe they need a dictator to avoid incessant intramural strife and conflict. Biden is making the American people pay for his fool's errand in Ukraine. Its fate is irrelevant to the national security of the United States. If it were otherwise, President Biden would have asked Congress for a declaration of war against Russia.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is a wild card. He could attract voters from Biden to hand victory to Trump.\n\nThe United States' ill-executed withdrawal from Afghanistan after squandering more than $300 million every day for 20 successive years of failure enabled the Taliban's return to power and capture of American weapons. But no one has paid a political price for this stupendous, criminal blunder that returned a second edition of Taliban grislier than the first.\n\nWhat about Hunter Biden, including the infamous laptop which 51 former intelligence officials falsely and recklessly disparaged as \"Russian disinformation?\" Add to that the tax fraud and firearm charges and notorious influence peddling.

Many analysts believe the $61 billion package will significantly improve Ukraine's military outlook, easing months of critical supply shortfalls and creating new opportunities to strike back at the invading Russian army.\n\nWhile most attention has so far focused on the military aspects of this new US aid package, the bill passed in Washington DC also includes an important step toward holding Russia financially accountable for the invasion of Ukraine. The Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunities for Ukrainians Act, or REPO Act, paves the way for seizures of Russian Central Bank holdings that have been frozen in the United States for more than two years, while also setting the stage for a more global approach to confiscating Russian assets.\n\nWestern countries froze approximately $300 billion in Russian assets following the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin has been unable to access these assets ever since, but they still technically belong to Russia. The REPO Act could now make it possible to seize Russian assets and use them for the benefit of Ukraine. Only around $5 billion of the overall $300 billion is located in the US, but the United States is setting an important precedent by taking a leadership position in the confiscation of Russian state funds.\n\nWe should not expect any immediate action. The REPO Act obliges the White House and US Treasury Department to identify Russian assets in the US within a 90-day period and report back to Congress in 180 days. After a further month, the president is then authorized to \"seize, confiscate, transfer, or vest\" any Russian state sovereign assets located within the United States.\n\nThe US is unlikely to act unilaterally. Instead, United States officials have indicated they wish to move forward in conjunction with other Western governments. The issue is set to be high on the agenda during the next G7 summit, which is scheduled to take place in Italy in June. \"The ideal is that we all move together,\" commented US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on April 24. This would send a message to Moscow that the democratic world is united in its commitment to make Russia pay for the largest European invasion since World War II.\n\nIn order to appreciate the significance of the REPO Act, it is helpful to track Russia's reaction. Since the aid bill passed, there has been plenty of outrage in Moscow. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed his wish for the United States to be \"plunged into a new civil war,\" and threatened to seize the assets of US citizens in Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that Russia would make the United States answer for the confiscation of frozen assets.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said Russia could now pass \"symmetrical\" legislation allowing Moscow to confiscate Western assets located inside the Russian Federation. Volodin was one of many Russian officials to claim that the US step was intended to \"provoke\" the adoption of parallel measures in EU countries. He predicted that this would be \"devastating\" for the European economy.\n\nSkeptics in the West have voiced concerns that the seizure of Russian assets could undermine the global financial system and weaken Western economies. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is one of numerous senior figures in Europe to express unease over the confiscation of Russian assets, arguing that it could mean \"breaking the international legal order that you want to protect, that you would want Russia and all countries around the world to respect.\"\n\nThis caution ignores the fact that Russian state assets in Western jurisdictions have now been frozen for more than two years without sparking any noticeable negative consequences for the international financial system. If measures against Russian assets were sufficient reason to trigger a loss of confidence in the existing financial system among other authoritarian states, they have already had ample time to react.\n\nThe statements coming out of Moscow over the past week underline the sensitivity within the Kremlin to the confiscation of frozen Russian money. While the REPO Act represents a meaningful milestone in the debate over Russian assets, it is not decisive. Nevertheless, this aspect of the aid package has attracted almost as much attention as the very significant additional military support that is now being sent to Ukraine.\n\nIt would certainly seem that members of Russia's ruling elite are more concerned about the security of their own financial resources than the safety of the Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. Indeed, many observers have long argued that Putin's top priority is safeguarding his own ill-gotten wealth and that of his inner circle. If the West is serious about defeating Russia in Ukraine, it should seek to exploit this apparent vulnerability.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the REPO Act, the next stage in the process should be the promotion of similar draft laws by the European Union and G7 countries. The recent US decision on Russian assets can provide the impetus others have been waiting for. Russia only understands the language of strength, and views hesitation as an invitation to go further. Western leaders can now demonstrate their resolve by acting together to make Russia pay for its criminal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKira Rudik is leader of the Golos party, member of the Ukrainian parliament, and Vice President of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE).\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nImage: Russian missiles targeted Ukraine's two biggest cities early Tuesday, damaging apartment buildings and killing at least 10 people after Moscow shunned any deal backed by Kyiv and its Western allies to end the almost two-year war. The Russian barrage included more than 40 ballistic, cruise, anti-aircraft and guided missiles, officials said. Ukraine's air force said it intercepted 21 of them. In Kharkiv, in northeast Ukraine, the onslaught killed five and injured 48, including four minors, as the missiles damaged around 30 residential buildings and shattered hundreds of apartment windows in icy weather, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russia used S-300, Kh-32 and hypersonic Iskander missiles in the attack, he said. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the temperature in the city was minus 7 degrees Celsius (19 degrees Fahrenheit). An entire section of a multi-story residential building was destroyed, trapping an unknown number of people there, Terekhov said. Kharkiv, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border with Russia, has often felt the brunt of Russia's winter campaign of long-range strikes that commonly hit civilian areas. The attacks keep Ukrainians on edge while the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line has barely budged. Both sides' inability to deliver a knockout punch on the battlefield has pushed the fighting toward trench and artillery warfare. Analysts say the Kremlin's forces stockpiled missiles at the end of last year to press a winter campaign of aerial bombardment.

He described the situation as \"dynamic,\" with some positions changing hands several times per day.\n\nThe assessment came as Ukraine expects the arrival of the long-expected batch of US military materiel. It also confirmed recent warnings from US and UK officials that Vladimir Putin's troops have looked to press their advantage while Kyiv's forces are underequipped and short on manpower.\n\nRead more: Russian forces advance, target railways as Kyiv awaits weapons\n\nSyrskyi listed half a dozen areas where Russia was pushing forward with increased pressure. The most difficult situation was west of the Russia-held city of Donetsk, where Moscow's troops forced Ukrainians to give up some positions near the towns of Kurakhove and Pokrovsk.\n\nRussian forces expanded their control further north from Donetsk by capturing the town of Novobakhmutivka, the defence ministry in Moscow reported on Sunday. Ukraine hasn't commented on the town's status.\n\nMoscow's troops also had some limited success near an important logistics hub of Kupyansk in the northeast, according to Syrskyi, as well as north of Bakhmut. Putin's commanders were eyeing a potential offensive move toward Slovyansk, the Ukraine-held city that was the scene of heavy fighting as far back as 2014.\n\nUkrainian forces were able to improve their positions near Kupyansk and Lyman as well as liberate another island in the sprawling Dnipro River delta near Kherson, Syrskyi said.\n\nMilitary commanders were also monitoring the Russian buildup of forces near Kharkiv, not far from the border in Ukraine's northeast, even as Kyiv sees no immediate threat of a major offensive in the north.\n\n\"Russian forces will likely make significant tactical gains in the coming weeks as Ukraine waits for US security assistance to arrive at the front, but remain unlikely to overwhelm Ukrainian defences,\" the US-based Institute for the Study of War wrote in an overnight update.\n\nAustralia has ramped up military aid for Ukraine, with A$100-million ($65-million) in new funding to go towards short-range air defence systems, drone development and other equipment needed in the nation's war against Russia.\n\n\"While Ukraine is here fighting for its sovereignty and for its nation, it is also fighting for the maintenance of the global rules-based order and in that sense, it's fighting for us,\" Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles said on Saturday in Lviv, Ukraine. \"Ukraine need to be empowered to resolve this on their terms.\"\n\nThe latest funding brings the total amount Australia has contributed to Ukraine's war efforts since the conflict began in February 2022 to A$1-billion. On Friday, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed a $6-billion commitment for long-term contracts to provide Kyiv with weapons such as Patriot missiles, artillery ammunition and drones.\n\nUkraine sustained a heavy Russian missile barrage overnight aimed at gas infrastructure and other targets while striking back a Russian oil refinery with drones.\n\nMoscow reported a Ukrainian drone attack on the Slavyansk oil refinery in the Krasnodar region, the first such strike since early this month.\n\nThe state-run news agency Tass said the strike caused a fire, which partially suspended refinery operations. The plant was hit by 10 drones, Tass said, citing the refinery's representative. Russia's defence ministry said 66 drones were intercepted and downed over the Krasnodar region.\n\nDrones from the Security Service of Ukraine targeted the Kushchevsk military airfield and the Slavyansk and Ilsky refineries in the Krasnodar region, according to a person with knowledge of the operation who wasn't authorised to speak publicly. Russian officials and media haven't referred to the Ilsky facility.\n\nThe Slavyansk refinery is capable of processing four million tonnes of oil a year and is one of the closest facilities to the war zone in eastern Ukraine. It was previously hit by drones in March along with many other large Russian refineries. Some of the affected facilities are still processing less than before the attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine, some 21 Russian missiles of various types were intercepted overnight out of 34 fired, the Ukrainian Air Force said on Telegram. Poland's army scrambled jets twice when Russian missiles flew close to its border.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said in a statement that recent strikes, including the overnight barrage, had targeted energy and defence facilities and railway infrastructure in response to Kyiv's attempts to \"damage Russian energy and industrial facilities\".\n\nTargets fired at by Kremlin troops included energy facilities in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions in the west, and the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine, the national grid operator Ukrenergo said in a statement on Facebook.\n\nState-run Naftogaz said gas infrastructure facilities came under attack but that service to clients and Ukrainian consumers wasn't interrupted.\n\n\"Hits on power plants in Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk put thousands of Ukrainians in the dark,\" Bridget Brink, the US ambassador to Ukraine, said on X. \"Other cities were hit as well, including damage to a Kharkiv hospital.\"\n\nRussian forces pressed forward in eastern Ukraine and in some areas accelerated their advance as Kyiv's depleted forces awaited badly needed US weaponry, according to US and UK officials.\n\nKremlin forces were moving against defensive lines west of the Russian-occupied city of Bakhmut in the embattled Donetsk region, according to the White House National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby. Farther south, Russian troops were accelerating an advance west of Avdiivka, a stronghold they captured in February, UK military intelligence said on Friday on social media platform X.\n\n\"It's slow progress, but they're pushing back on the Ukrainian lines, the first, the second and even pushing on the third,\" Kirby told NBC News on Friday. \"And that's dangerous.\"\n\nPutin's troops made grinding progress along the 1,200km front as US officials said that ammunition, as well as long-range missiles capable of attacking deep behind Russian lines, were on their way. Kirby said they would arrive \"very, very soon\" and potentially shift momentum in the war that has tilted in Russia's favour.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged that the six months of waiting as US Republicans held up a $61-billion aid package had allowed Russia's military to \"seize the initiative.\" But he said the fresh assistance would be enough to halt the Russian advance -- and turn the tide.\n\nFor now, Moscow's ground forces have built on their advance since they seized Avdiivka two months ago. Russia's military entered the town of Ocheretyne, some 15km north of Avdiivka's city centre, according to both UK military intelligence and DeepState, an open-source database maintained by volunteers in cooperation with Ukraine's Defence Ministry.\n\nAnalysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) called the advance \"relatively quick\", if marginal, and attributed it to the rapid Ukrainian pullout from Avdiivka to weaker defensive positions.\n\nStill, that area holds less value compared with Russia's approach to Chasiv Yar, a strategically located settlement west of Bakhmut where Moscow has mounted a furious offensive.\n\n\"Seizure of the town would likely allow Russian forces to launch subsequent offensive operations against cities that form a significant Ukrainian defensive belt in Donetsk Oblast,\" ISW analysts said, speculating that Moscow may be making a bid to seize territory before US aid arrives.\n\nRussia has escalated missile and drone attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure in recent weeks and stepped up the bombardment of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, amid worries among Western officials that the Ukrainian military is near breaking point.\n\nUS intelligence agencies have found that Putin probably didn't order opposition leader Alexei Navalny's death at a prison camp in February, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.\n\nWhile the assessment didn't dispute Putin's culpability for the death, it found that the timing possibly wasn't as intended by Putin, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The finding is broadly accepted within the intelligence community and shared by several agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the State Department's intelligence unit, according to the report.\n\nThe mysterious death of Navalny, an anti-corruption activist and Russia's most prominent opposition figure, at an Arctic prison in February triggered a fresh round of tensions between Russia and the West at a time when relations were fractured by the Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe latest assessment was based on a range of information such as classified intelligence and an analysis of public facts, including the timing of his death and how it overshadowed Putin's re-election, the WSJ report said.\n\nNavalny fell sick during a walk at the remote maximum-security prison camp in the Arctic where he was last held, and medical staff were unable to revive him, the prison authorities said on 16 February.

Instead, portraits may be displayed in cars and public locations between land 11 May.\n\nAccording to Meduza news, Victory Day parades in five Russian regions have also been cancelled, with security concerns cited. These include Bryansk, Pskov, Ryazan, Kursk and Belgorod. The regions listed are all in western Russia and are therefore likely vulnerable to Ukrainian uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) strikes. In the run up to last year's Victory Day parade, there was a UAV attack on the Kremlin.\n\nThis is the second year in a row that the Immortal Regiment March has been cancelled and Victory parades curtailed on security grounds. This year, President Putin's inauguration precedes Victory Day, taking place on 7 May. The potential for protests and discontent over the Ukraine war are also likely to have influenced the calculus of the Russian leadership.\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that on April 27, 112x tactical engagements were reported.\n\nRussian forces launched a total of 1x missile and 49x air strikes, 77x MLRS attacks on the positions of Ukrainian troops and various settlements.\n\nVolyn and Polissya axes: no significant changes.

Indicating that the handful of Ukrainian pilots being trained wouldn't be 'battle ready' till much later this year. As they are young (21-23?) and inexperienced. Did I remember that correctly? I'd thought that experienced pilots with a foundation of English were being trained...\n\nThanks always for gathering updates that keep us grounded -- even when it's hard to read.\n\nFirst, you are most welcome. To answer your question, yes, that was me. The bottom line is that it was specifically referring to the group of least experienced/youngest Ukrainian pilots. Instead of being ready by June, that cohort is more likely to be ready by August. Here's the details from Euromaidan Press:\n\nTen Ukrainian pilots are currently at an airbase in southwest France, learning the basics of aerial combat as part of the training for 45 F-16s arriving in Ukraine this summer, BFMTV reports.\n\nAfter the United States approved last fall, countries including the Netherlands, Denmark, and Romania are helping train Ukrainian F-16 pilots to counter Russia's air superiority. Currently, twelve Ukrainian pilots are being trained in Denmark, Britain, and the US, and are expected to be combat-ready this summer. However, upon their return, only about six of the promised 45 F-16s from European allies may have been delivered, as per media reports.\n\nThe beginning of training in France was announced on 12 April by French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, who stated that future Ukrainian fighter pilots likely to operate American F-16 aircraft are starting their training in southern France with the French Air Force. France doesn't operate F-16s.\n\nThe young pilots are the ones receiving training abroad because the experienced aviators have remained in Ukraine to fly the fleet's aircraft amid the ongoing all-out Russo-Ukrainian war.\n\nBFMTV reports that this summer, 45 F-16s are expected to be delivered to the Ukrainian army. According to the think tank Ifri, Denmark will provide 19 jets - 14 in 2024 and five in 2025. Norway is reportedly contributing 22, with the remaining aircraft sourced from the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nWhile some pilots are trained in Europe, with France training a portion of them, the technical teams, including mechanics, are likely to be trained in the USA, according to BFMTV. Each aircraft requires a crew of about a dozen people, including the pilots.\n\nEarlier, the Ukrainian Air Force spokesman reported that two Ukrainian pilot groups were refining their F-16 skills in Denmark and the USA, with another group transitioning from the UK to France for light aircraft training. He also mentioned that Ukrainian F-16 technical personnel are being trained to eventually instruct their peers in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kyiv Independent has more on the three cohorts of pilots in training.\n\nThere are three separate programs for pilots at different levels. Earlier this month, Air Force spokesman Yurii Ihnat said that six advanced pilots are already flying F-16s in Denmark and should be ready to fight in the spring. The least experienced group is training in the U.K. -- they might not be ready until 2025.\n\nAn intermediate group training in Arizona is expected to graduate later this year, according to a Jan. 4 briefing by the U.S. State Department.\n\nUkrainian ground crews are also learning to service the aircraft.\n\nThe first batch of planes may be coming from the Netherlands. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Dec. 22 said that his government started preparing the initial 18 fighter jets, while a spokesperson from the Dutch Defense Ministry told NOS that more jets may be delivered at a later date. There have been no updates since then.\n\nDenmark had pledged to supply six planes by the end of 2023, but the delivery date has been reportedly pushed back six months. Copenhagen said it would give 19 planes in total.\n\nDanish and Dutch officials have said the delivery schedule depends on the readiness of Ukraine's infrastructure and pilots, among other factors.\n\nBelgium's defense minister has promised several jets, which would likely arrive in 2025. According to Norwegian broadcaster NRK, Norway plans to send between five and 10 planes, but neither the total number or the delivery schedule has been fixed.\n\nExperts told the Kyiv Independent that Ukraine will likely have at least some F-16s operational in late spring or early summer.\n\nIf everything goes right, then the Ukrainians should have six F-16s sometime by late May or early June and a group of pilots to fly them and ground crews to service them. The remainder of planes, pilots, and ground crews will then become available in bits and bobs over time into 2025. Six F-16s with pilots and ground crews is better than no F-16s, pilots, or ground crews, but it's not what the popular perception has been about what is happening. This is part of the reason I have been so hard on the Biden nat-sec team. These planes, pilots, and ground crews were needed no later than spring of 2023. Had the training started in the late summer/early fall of 2022, then when the Biden administration finally overcame its fears in the fall of 2023 and decided to allow allies and partners to provide F-16s to Ukraine, they would have been ready as soon as the announcement was made. Instead, several months were lost figuring out who was going to do what in terms of training, determining which planes would go, figuring out what they needed in terms of upgrades and service, then doing the upgrades and service, then doing the training, etc. By the time all of the promised F-16s get to Ukraine it'll be some time in the sometime in the spring or early summer of 2025. Two years after they would have had the greatest theater strategic impact. That's if everything goes right. It never does. I'll leave it there before I write something that hurts someone's feelings.\n\n28 April 2024 - 18:25\n\nI wish you health, fellow Ukrainians!\n\nWe are not losing a single day for Ukraine - I have just spoken with Hakeem Jeffries, the leader of the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. I thanked him and all the congressmen for their support of our country and personal leadership in advancing a new package of assistance to Ukraine. We are interacting with our partners at all levels to achieve the level of efficiency in assistance that is needed not only to hold our positions, but also to disrupt Russia's war plans. We are still waiting for the supplies promised to Ukraine - we expect exactly the volume and content of supplies that can change the situation on the battlefield in the interests of Ukraine. And it is important that every agreement we have reached is implemented - everything that will yield practical results on the battlefield and boost the morale of everyone on the frontline. In a conversation with Mr. Jeffries, I emphasized the need for Patriot systems, they are needed as soon as possible.\n\nAlso, our teams, Ukraine and the United States, are currently working on a bilateral security agreement, and we are already working on a specific text. Our goal is to make this agreement the strongest of all. We are discussing the specific foundations of our security and cooperation. We are also working on fixing specific levels of support for this year and for the next ten years, including armed support, financial, political, and joint arms production. The agreement should be truly exemplary and reflect the strength of American leadership. I am grateful to both our team and the team of the American side for the progress in drafting the agreement.\n\nNext week there will be quite a lot of international communication, both public and non-public. We remember what this year should bring us in the political sense, in particular the result with the European Union. Ukraine has fulfilled all the necessary conditions for the actual start of accession negotiations, and now it is up to the EU side to fulfill its obligations.\n\nWe continue preparations for the first inaugural Peace Summit in June, and our team, along with the teams of our key partners, is working to make the Summit truly global. We can say for sure that all continents will be represented - different parts of the world, different views on global development. But all of them share the same recognition that the UN Charter and basic international conventions are binding documents for every country in the world, including a country like Russia, where madness prevails. The world majority must force Russia into peace - and it can do this. It is in June that the path to a just peace can begin.\n\nWe are also preparing for the NATO Summit to be held this summer. A strong political signal is needed - the Alliance should not be afraid of its own strength or shy away from its own foundations - every country that shares common values and is willing to actually defend them deserves an invitation to join the Alliance.\n\nAnd our unwavering gratitude to the warriors - to all the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine, to each and every one of them at the front, at combat posts, on combat missions. Kharkiv region, Donetsk direction, all the southern directions. I am grateful to every soldier and commander who is doing everything to destroy the occupiers - this is needed the most.\n\nAccording to the results of the week, the warriors of the 57th and 58th separate motorized infantry brigades, as well as the warriors of the 35th separate marine brigade deserve special gratitude. I would also like to mention our border guards, both those who are fighting on the frontline alongside everyone else, and those who are protecting our border communities and destroying Russian subversive groups. Special gratitude goes to all the servicemen of the Dozor special forces unit of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. Also, to the warriors of the Revenge brigade - and I would like to thank Staff Sergeant Oleksandr Meteyko, Senior Sergeants Serhiy Nesterenko and Sviatoslav Ihnatiuk for their special results. The Steel Frontier brigade - Staff Sergeant Ivan Koval, Sergeant Vitaliy Mykytenko, and Senior Soldier Yevhen Kolesnik. Well done! Chernihiv and Volyn border guard detachments - Senior Soldiers Mykhailo Danyliuk and Mykhailo Myndiuk, Sergeants Yuriy Romashyn and Mykhailo Sereda, and Senior Sergeant Roman Novyk. Sumy border guard detachment - Soldier Andriy Krut and Staff Sergeant Yuriy Popkov particularly distinguished themselves... I also thank all the soldiers of our Kharkiv detachment, especially Senior Soldiers Denys Shevchenko and Volodymyr Shevtsov, and Major Andriy Kuchynskyi. I am proud of you all, warriors!\n\nI am grateful to everyone who is with Ukraine, who is in Ukraine and for whom Ukraine is the only home on Earth.\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nHere's a machine translation of Colonel General Syrsky's full statement from his Telegram channel:\n\nThe situation at the front worsened. Trying to seize the strategic initiative and break through the front line, the enemy concentrated the main efforts in several directions, creating a significant advantage in forces and means. Actively attacks along the entire front line, in some directions - has tactical successes. There is a dynamic change in the situation, individual positions change \"from hand to hand\" several times during the day, which gives rise to an ambiguous understanding of the situation.\n\nWhat is actually happening at the front?\n\nHeavy fighting continued across the front line this week. The situation was changing dynamically - in some areas the enemy had tactical success, and in some areas it was possible to improve the tactical position of our troops.\n\nIn Luhansk region, the enemy is trying to take advantage of its advantage in air, missiles and the number of artillery ammunition. The main task for himself is to reach the administrative border of the Luhansk region.\n\nThe main areas where the enemy's efforts are concentrated in the Kupyan direction are the villages of Stelmakhivka and Berestov. There, the enemy had partial success, but was stopped by the actions of our units. Also, continues the offensive on the village of Terny in the Lymansky direction, tries to push the Defense Forces of Ukraine beyond the Black Stallion River, without success.\n\nIn the Siversk direction, the enemy is advancing in the area of Bilogorivka and Rozdolivka, trying to break through and block Siversk in order to create conditions for the continuation of the offensive on Slovyansk. There are no successes, his progress in this direction is stopped.\n\nIn the Kramatorsk direction, Ivanovske and Chasiv Yar remain the hottest spots. Also, the enemy is trying to bring Klishchiivka under its control and go to the border along the \"Siverskyi Donets-Donbas\" channel.\n\nThe most difficult situation is in the Pokrovsky and Kurakhiv directions, where fierce battles continue. The enemy deployed up to four brigades in these directions, is trying to develop an offensive west of Avdiyivka and Maryinka, making its way to Pokrovsk and Kurakhovo. Units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, preserving the lives and health of our defenders, moved to new frontiers west of Berdychi, Semenivka and Novomykhailivka. In general, the enemy achieved certain tactical successes in these directions, but could not gain operational advantages. Ukrainian troops inflict maximum losses on the enemy, both in terms of personnel and military equipment. In order to strengthen the defense in these directions, to replace the units that have suffered losses, the brigades that have regained combat capability are being moved.\n\nThe situation is still tense in the South, in the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions. On the Novopavlivskyi direction, the enemy is trying to advance in the Staromayorsky area, on the Orihivskyi - in the Robotyny and Verbovoiy areas, on the Khersonskyi - they still hope to knock out our troops from Krynyk. There is no success in any of the directions. Moreover, in the direction of Kherson, our units managed to advance in the area of Veletenskyi and establish control over the island of Nestryga.\n\nAlso, the Defense Forces of Ukraine managed to improve their tactical position in the area of Synkivka (Kupian direction) and Serebryan Forestry (Lyman direction).\n\nIn the North of Ukraine, the enemy continues shelling border settlements in the Sumy and Chernihiv regions, conducts sabotage and reconnaissance activities. There are no signs of direct enemy preparation for offensive actions in the North of Ukraine. At the same time, we are monitoring the increase in the number and regrouping of enemy troops in the Kharkiv direction. In the most threatening directions, our troops have been reinforced by artillery and tank units.\n\nWe continue the rotation of military units in order to organize personnel rest and restore the combat capability of our military units.\n\nTraining of personnel in training centers continues, the main emphasis is placed on quality and skill in handling weapons.\n\nWork on the fortification equipment of defensive lines and positions continues.\n\nWe are also working with partners to obtain weapons, weapons and military equipment as soon as possible.\n\nTogether to victory!\n\nGlory to Ukraine!\n\nt.me/osirskiy/670\n\nRussian Telegram channels report the Ukrainian military attacked a Russian air defense unit at Cape Tarkhankut overnight allegedly with ATACMS missiles.\n\nIn addition, a powerful explosion is reported in Dzhankoi and Dzhankoi district of occupied Crimea.\n\nAccording to Suspilne, more than ten explosions sounded around 1 am in Razdolne district bordering Dzhankoi in northern Crimea.\n\nThere is no official information on the strike yet.\n\nDespite the explosions, Russians want to rest in Crimea: the tourist flow has been off the scale since the morning of April 28. Local Telegram channels report about queues for inspections in Taman and Chonhar checkpoint (on video).\n\nCrimea has become one of the few alternatives for restricted Russians.\n\nRussians are used to celebrating Easter holidays (next week) in Crimea.\n\nWell, Russians love fireworks and salutes.\n\nOn the border of Zaprizhzhia and Donetsk Oblasts:\n\nAn update on the octogenarian who fled Russian occupied Donetsk on foot:\n\nIvan Vivsianyk, 88, who fled the Russian-occupied village of Ocheretyne on foot under shelling because he did not want to live with a Russian passport, settled in Dnipro region and plans to garden.\n\nMr. Ivan said that Russian occupiers threatened to shoot him, they took away his Ukrainian documents. He walked for more than six hours with one bag, and then hitched a ride to Pokrovsk. There the man asked for help.\n\nNow, at the center for evacuees in Dnipro, Mr. Ivan is recovering. The head of the center says that despite his age, Ivan is independent and eager to lead an active life.\n\n\"He wants to garden. I think, he will find a a partner here. He enjoys success among our grandmothers and not only grandmothers, so I think we don't need to worry. He is an independent person - he showed himself right away,\" Olha Volkova, head of the temporary accommodation center said.\n\nIvan Vivsianyk is sure that he will also harvest tomatoes and grapes, at least in Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\n\ud83d\udcf9: TSN\n\nOdesa. A family stands on the ruins of their house, which was destroyed by a Russian drone on April 23.\n\nKhrystyna and Ruslan have three children. Little Andriana, who is only 1 year old, nine-year-old Vadym, and twelve-year-old Vanya, who is in the hospital. The family was at home at the time of the explosion. It's a miracle that they survived, but the eldest son was injured.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7: Libkos\n\nFor those wondering, here's an update on what has happened to the Wagner Group since Prigozhin was killed.\n\nSeven months after the fiery death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the audacious oligarch whose private army known as the Wagner Group led an insurrection against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Russian state is establishing control of the private mercenaries and putting them to work pursuing the Kremlin's agenda.\n\nThe thousands of the former Wagner forces have splintered into at least four groups, according to two U.S. officials granted anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters.\n\nBy mixing the fighters with other mercenaries loyal to Putin, the Russian government hopes to prevent a repeat of the events of last year, when a unified Wagner turned on Putin and his defense ministry.\n\n\"Part of the objective of the restructuring is to make sure there is more control over the operations overall,\" one of the U.S. officials said.\n\nThe new private armies are already being deployed across the world on special missions, including to Ukraine and Africa, where they are expected to play a similarly destabilizing role on the global stage as when under the command of Prigozhin, the officials said. The reconstituted paramilitary groups have already forced the Biden administration to withdraw troops from Niger and Chad -- in major setbacks for counterterrorism -- while challenging U.S. policies in the Central African Republic, Mali, Burkina Faso, Libya and other African nations.\n\nOne of the four groups is aligned with Russia's National Guard. It has already transferred to Ukraine and lost a significant number of fighters. Two other groups are operating under the control of the defense ministry and Moscow's intelligence services. The fourth group -- known as the Africa Corps and aligned with an existing group known as Redut -- is still working to assume control of former Wagner forces in some African capitals, the officials said.\n\nLittle else is known about the breakdown of the new factions, including how many members come from Prigozhin's Wagner versus other existing paramilitary organizations. It's also unclear to what extent Prigozhin's son, who initially took control of thousands of Wagner mercenaries after his father's death, is still involved in leading a smaller group of fighters still loyal to his father's memory. The younger Prigozhin is likely in charge of some forces in the Central African Republic and Mali, the officials said.\n\nPrigozhin died last August when his plane exploded in midair. The crash was widely viewed as a state-sponsored assassination, ordered by Putin.\n\nPrigozhin's death left the fate of his empire in limbo. At that time, the Wagner Group was in the process of establishing close ties to the leaders of rogue African states, providing security to dictators while engaging in lucrative mining operations.\n\nIn the Central African Republic, for instance, Wagner had taken control of a gold mine. In the wake of Prigozhin's death, his former subordinates have significantly expanded the mine, U.S. officials said, but have not yet found a way to efficiently market and ship the minerals. They would reap hundreds of millions of dollars in profit on the global market.\n\nPrigozhin also oversaw a sweeping disinformation operation that organized protests in Africa, helped place falsified news stories in media outlets around the world and ran massive troll farms to destabilize elections in Western Europe, the United States and other democracies.\n\nThe disinformation arms are now likely under the control of Russia's foreign intelligence service, the U.S. officials said. And Prigozhin's economic employees may have been placed under other intelligence offices, including the military's intelligence directorate.\n\nMoscow's newly asserted command of these private mercenaries has vast implications for geopolitics. In Africa, especially, it could undermine the Biden administration's efforts to fight terrorism, promote democracy and forge diplomatic ties to newly formed regimes.\n\n\"The timing element is key here. Russia can give these countries what the U.S. cannot and immediately,\" one of the U.S. officials said, referring to Moscow's ability to use private fighters to provide under-the-table weapons and ammunition to newly formed military governments in Africa. \"And a lot of the leaders of those countries are sick of the U.S. lecturing them about democracy.\"\n\nMoscow's direct control of paramilitary groups could also convince some African countries that had previously shied away from the Wagner Group -- which was under global sanctions as a criminal organization -- to reconsider their resistance, said the officials.\n\nMoscow's use of the paramilitary fighters to spread its influence in Africa is already visible in Niger, one of the most important outposts in the war against terrorism.\n\nNigerien military leaders took control from the country's elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, last July. The coup prompted Washington to suspend its economic and military aid to the country while the Biden administration pushed the military leaders to transition back to a civilian-led democracy.\n\nEarlier this month, however, hundreds of Russian mercenaries arrived in the capital city of Niamey, claiming they were there to help train Niger's military and to enter into a formal partnership with the ruling junta.\n\nTheir arrival came just days before the Biden administration announced that the U.S. would withdraw its 1,000 troops from the country after nearly 10 years, creating the appearance of Russian forces supplanting those of the U.S. in a country where terrorist groups have organized and plotted global attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, in Chad, another country with a significant presence of former Wagner fighters, the Biden administration announced this week that it was withdrawing about 75 special operations forces who had been performing counterterrorism roles, at the request of the local government.\n\nThe move was widely seen as another instance of Russia supplanting U.S. influence.\n\nFormer Wagner fighters also remain active in Mali, Libya and Sudan, where they have contracts to provide security to unstable regimes. The U.S. has tried to counter Wagner's presence in those nations and the Central African Republic, urging officials to distance themselves from Russia.\n\nIn another country, Burkina Faso, as in Niger and Chad, former Wagner forces are now under firm control of the Africa Corps.\n\nBut the two U.S. officials caution that there are risks to Russia's strategy -- especially pertaining to ongoing questions about the loyalty of former Wagner fighters and their willingness to take orders from the country's oft-maligned defense ministry.\n\nEven before his insurrection, Prigozhin would often publicly condemn the ministry of defense, blaming its leaders for setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine. And his final break with Putin occurred when he attempted to force the ouster of Sergei Shoigu, minister of defense, and Valery Gerasimov, the military's chief of staff.\n\nPrigozhin blamed the duo for the poor performance of Russian troops. He also claimed that they had exaggerated the largely illusory threat posed by Ukraine to push Putin into an unwise war.\n\nMany of Wagner's fighters have remained loyal to Prigozhin's memory and similarly disliked the defense minister. Now, some of them are being led by that very official -- Shoigu -- in a highly selective group known as Patriot. It is supervised and financed by the ministry of defense, officials say.\n\n\"It's unclear if Moscow will be able to pull off what Wagner has done for years,\" a third U.S. official said. \"These fighters are being put into an existing, bureaucratic system that might slow things down and make them less dangerous.\"", "source": {"uri": "balloon-juice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Balloon Juice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_l_silverman@balloon-juice.com", "name": "Adam L Silverman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://balloon-juice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Silverman_On_Security.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9518671", "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 452041525, "relevance": 9, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ba8"}

War is hell.\" He then laments that his \"Democratic U.S. representatives continue to fund war against Palestine, against Russia ... .\" Israel is not fighting against Palestine; they are fighting against Hamas. And Israel did not start the war, Hamas did. Similarly, Ukraine did not start the war against Russia; Russia invaded Ukraine. The U.S. is supporting Israel and Ukraine in defending themselves. Without our support, there would still be wars; however, there would be a much higher chance that Israel and Ukraine would be defeated.\n\nThe writer makes the mistake of thinking that there is a choice between war and peace. That isn't correct. When your country is attacked, the choice is between fighting back and being slaughtered.\n\nA reader wrote that he was giving up support for the Democratic Party because he claims it has become the \"party of war,\" and that the \"party of Trump\" was a better alternative. He was right to use that name for the former Republican Party, but to conclude that it is the \"lesser of two evils\" is beyond ridiculous.\n\nOur support of Ukraine seems justifiable given that Vladimir Putin chose to wage this war against unarmed civilians. The war in Israel is a complicated, detestable situation, but it doesn't define the current state of American politics. We no longer have a valid basis for comparing the ideologies of the two major parties. We have one party that still respects the rule of law and attempts to govern from that perspective, and yes, its policies leave a lot of room for disagreement. The other party has been hijacked by an individual who defers to Putin and who is incapable of considering anyone's need ahead of his own insatiable desires. The GOP now has no platform, no ideology, not even a moral compass. A vote for the Republican nominee or any of his sycophantic enablers is an endorsement of the worst of human nature. A vote for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the reader intends, is the same as a vote for Trump. We must at least have a functioning political party in power in order to debate and shape foreign policy.\n\nA response to the writer of a recent letter on smoking in Minneapolis (Readers Write, April 24): I have a few thoughts (at my advanced age, made hasty by time remaining). The foremost is an observation that a quick search of the web reveals there are no less than six free medical smoker cessation programs in the Twin Cities you have available for your father to attend. It would be a good son's gesture if you help him do so.\n\nOn the subject of the cigar shops, while the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act (MCIAA) does prohibit indoor smoking, even in one's own home if it is used for business, as you noted it does allow sampling of products. On that note, personally, when I come to cities I stop and sample a cigar -- sampling meaning sitting down and smoking it to the end. The aim of sampling is to see how it smokes (the burn and ash color), and I note the ever-changing flavor profile and finally review its end remaining colors. So yes, I smoke the entire $20-to-$50 or more cigar to properly sample it so I know if I want to purchase a box for hundreds, sometime thousands of dollars, or not. So, the question is, if you were a cigar smoker, would you not do the same sampling before purchasing a box and contributing heavily to the tax coffers?\n\nThe other error in banning sampling lounges is that the consequences are great. Under MCIAA, the law does not prohibit outdoor smoking, regardless of the distance from building openings such as doors or windows. The city's cigar shops have already indicated they would simply install half walls, as allowed under the MCIAA, and continue their business in a year-round patio setting. Unlike the current indoor setting with state-of-the-art filtering and ventilation, the patio setting would simply let the smoke out onto the sidewalk walkers, pets and baby carriages, into adjoining windows, doors and cars passing by. To conclude, please be cautious how you advocate to change laws that are working, without knowing all of the facts and consequences first.\n\nMinnesota leads the nation in protecting public health and the environment from all PFAS chemicals (\"We regulate a tiny fraction of the 12,000 'forever chemicals,\" StarTribune.com, April 23). While federal regulations are rolling out for individual types of PFAS, Minnesota's superfund law allows us to hold polluters responsible for all types of PFAS.\n\nThanks to action from the Minnesota Legislature and the Walz-Flanagan administration, we're prioritizing PFAS pollution prevention by helping manufacturers transition to safer alternatives while implementing a new law that phases out nonessential use of PFAS by 2032. Some products, including cookware, carpets and dental floss, must be PFAS-free by January 2025.\n\nPreventing PFAS pollution is in the best interest of public health and public funds, which too often must be used for costly cleanup expenses. While these chemicals cost between $50 and $1,000 per pound to purchase, removing and destroying them from wastewater costs between $2.7 million and $18 million per pound. All Minnesotans will benefit as we turn off the tap of PFAS entering the environment.\n\nKatrina Kessler, St. Paul\n\nThe writer is commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor: If a president says a rival is corrupt and orders their assassination, \"is that within his official acts for which he can get immunity?\"\n\nTrump lawyer D. John Sauer: \"It would depend on the hypothetical, but we can see that could well be an official act.\"\n\nWhat have we become? Talking about presidential pardonable assassination of a political rival as cavalierly as ordering a cheeseburger? Sad and terrifying.\n\nOn April 25, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about the scope of presidential immunity. There was general agreement that there should be immunity for \"official acts.\" There was disagreement of what constitutes an \"official act.\" There was also question about whether an official act loses that status if it is motivated by private personal benefit to the president. And there were many other twists to consideration of when absolute immunity should apply after a president leaves office and whether a former president should be entitled to pre-prosecution court relief on the immunity issue before suffering the expense and inconvenience of a criminal prosecution.\n\nThe resolution of these, and likely many related issues, seems complex and incapable of resolution without a specific factual scenario. The wise course of action for the Supreme Court is to decide only the facts of the case before it. It would be unwise for the court to attempt to state a broader immunity rule. What the court should do is simply to state that there is no immunity for the allegations of the case before it. The allegations and clear evidence of Trump's conduct shows intent to obstruct constitutional election process and state election procedures. There should be no need for a remand to the trial court to decide immunity claims in this case.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/OPDJKZED7VFJJJ4OGQTUCLSICI.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 452041504, "relevance": 3, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657ba9"}

It came in addition to profits at US lenders such as Citigroup and JPMorgan.\n\nThe taxes paid by European banks, equivalent to about 0.4 per cent of all Russia's expected non-energy budget revenues for 2024, are an example of how foreign companies remaining in the country help the Kremlin maintain financial stability despite western sanctions.\n\nThe foreign lenders have benefited not just from higher interest rates but also from international sanctions on Russian banks. Such measures have deprived their rivals' access to international payments systems and increased western banks' own appeal to clients in the country.\n\nMore than half of the European banks' \u20ac800mn tax payments correspond to Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International, which has the largest presence in Russia of the foreign lenders.\n\nRBI's Russian profits more than tripled to \u20ac1.8bn between 2021 and 2023, accounting for half of the Austrian group's total profit, compared with about a third before the war.\n\nIn addition to regular tax contributions in 2023, Raiffeisen paid \u20ac47mn as the result of a windfall levy the Kremlin imposed on some companies last year.\n\nAfter President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, RBI repeatedly voiced its plan to downsize and divest its operations in Russia. It has faced persistent criticism from the European Central Bank and the US Treasury department for not yet completing the withdrawal.\n\nAlthough RBI has made some efforts to reduce its Russian exposure -- such as a 56 per cent decrease in its loan book since early 2022 -- some measures point to the contrary.\n\nRecent job postings by RBI in Russia suggest ambitious plans for \"multiple expansion of the active client base\", the FT has reported.\n\nDeutsche Bank, Hungary's OTP and Commerzbank had significantly reduced their presence in Russia, which was already small compared with RBI, their representatives said. Intesa is the closest to exiting but has yet to sell its Russian business. UniCredit declined to comment.\n\nDespite closing its corporate and retail business, Citigroup, the US's fourth-largest lender, which earned $149mn profit and paid $53mn in Russia in 2023, became the fourth-biggest taxpayer among western banks in Russia, according to the Kyiv School of Economics' calculations based on Russian Central Bank data.\n\nAnother American giant, JPMorgan, earned $35mn and paid $6.8mn in taxes, according to the research institution.\n\nJPMorgan, once the main contractor of Russian banks for opening correspondent accounts in US dollars, has been trying to leave since 2022. The bank is now stuck and facing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit from its former partner in Russia, VTB.\n\nThe US banks' figures are not included in the \u20ac800mn total as they do not report comparable Russian results on the group accounts used for the FT calculations.\n\nWestern lenders have benefited from the imposition of sanctions on most of the Russian financial sector, which has denied access to the Swift international interbank payment system. That made international banks a financial lifeline between Moscow and the west.\n\nSuch factors contributed to RBI's net fee and commission income in Russia increasing threefold from \u20ac420mn in 2021 to \u20ac1.2bn in 2023.\n\n\"It is not only in RBI's interest to stay in Russia. The [Russian central bank] will do everything it can to not let them go because there are few non-sanctioned banks through which Russia can receive and send Swift payments,\" a senior Russian banking executive said.\n\nThe central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to the executive, Russian and foreign counterparties now often settle cross-border payments in roubles, but the Russian currency also goes through accounts at RBI and similar banks \"to reduce sanctions risk\" and \"speed up the process\".\n\nThe international banks' combined revenue, profit and tax figures have fallen since 2022 but remain much higher than prewar results.\n\nThe banks have also benefited from interest rate rises with the Russian central bank's key rate now at 16 per cent, almost two times higher than before the war.\n\nThe rate increases have helped the lenders earn bumper revenues from their floating-rate loans and accumulate extra income from funds trapped in Russian deposit accounts.\n\nThe banks cannot access cash earned in Russia due to regulatory restrictions imposed in 2022 that prohibited dividend payouts from Russian subsidiaries to businesses from \"unfriendly\" western countries.\n\n\"We can't do anything with Russian deposits apart from keeping them with the central bank. So as interest rates went up, so did our profits,\" a senior executive at a European bank with a Russian subsidiary said.\n\nAbout 20 per cent of the tax payments to the Russian budget in 2023 made by OTP consisted of taxes on dividends, the bank said. Much of its funds remain stuck in deposit accounts in Russia, it added.\n\nLocked-up cash presents a significant obstacle to exiting Russia. Since early 2022 the banks have also required personal authorisation by President Vladimir Putin for the sale of their Russian operations.\n\nOnly seven western banks -- out of 45 included in the list of those in need of presidential approval to exit -- have received such an authorisation, including Mercedes-Benz Bank and Intesa.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fdb3f8417-895a-4d6b-b484-2facd36258b0.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900&overlay=https://www.ft.com/__assets/creatives/x/ft-overlay.png&overlay_height=0.15&overlay_y=30&overlay_gravity=south_east", "eventUri": "eng-9521814", "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 452041393, "relevance": 3, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657baa"}

The deal was done and a dangerously divided Republican majority smiled nervously.\n\nThe Democrats and the Biden Administration cheered, many holding little blue and yellow Ukrainian flags on the House floor. But before singing a transatlantic rendition of Beethoven's Ode to Joy, let's view the realistic options both Washington and the Europeans faced in aiding Ukraine, or not supporting Kyiv.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson did the right thing in finally bringing the package to the floor; Yet the vote was on each segment of the assistance package which Biden had lumped together in a $95 billion mega-bundle; Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan/Asia.\n\nStill the controversial American aid will not win the Ukraine war but does give Ukraine the chance to win. It equally underlines American credibility.\n\nThe Ukraine $62 billion assistance will help stabilize the situation on what is certainly the eve of a major Russian offensive by June. Getting more munitions and supplies to Ukrainian front-line units will significantly boost the sagging morale of defending units which have been pummeled by relentless Russian artillery barrages. Importantly more air defense will be provided to protect Ukrainian skies from Russian attacks on civilian centers. This is all warranted.\n\nThe big issue here is morale. More than two years into the conflict, the heady days of bloodying the Russian Goliath and having a chance to win the war have turned into a sullen despair as Moscow's military does what it does best: Use the sledgehammer despite hideous causalities to wear down an opponent.\n\nUkraine is bleeding and the perception was that the Americans and Europeans were talking a good line but not delivering munitions to bloody the bear.\n\nNow has this changed? Yes and no. Even prior to the new funding the United States has already provided $100 billion in military aid to the Kyiv government. More European aid must now follow too!\n\nUkrainian President Volodimir Zelensky admonished NATO defense ministers, saying, \"the choice of whether we are indeed allies,\" will be determined by whether NATO countries are willing to support his beleaguered country with more military aid. He described the state of Western assistance as \"very limited,\" but later hailed the \"lifesaving U.S. aid package.\"\n\nThe U.S, Germany and United Kingdom are Ukraine's major weapons suppliers. New American military aid includes air defense systems, long-range missiles and artillery shells.\n\nThe bill has now been approved by the U.S. Senate.\n\nRepublican Speaker Mike Johnson, facing a serious political revolt in his own party, called Marjorie Taylor Green's bluff and went ahead with the vote. That took courage. While Johnson was supported by former President Donald Trump and obviously by Joe Biden, he lost support from half the GOP members who voted against the bill including powerhouses like Elise Stefanik (R-NY). The final vote tally was a bittersweet 311-112.\n\nThough the GOP has been divided with a razor thin political majority, the right flank (Chaos Caucus) may try to dump Mike Johnson, as they foolishly did McCarthy.\n\nFeuding factions inside the Republican party have hobbled the Ukraine vote but the far deeper and malevolent warring factions inside the Democrat party delayed Israel/Gaza military aid for six months. The Israel aid passed too but notably with opposition from the Squad and the hard Left Palestine caucus.\n\nMainstream media mendacity towards the GOP concerning Ukraine was put in simplistic terms that somehow the Republicans did not want to help embattled Ukraine in its fight for survival against Russia. Well not quite...\n\nJohnson and the Republicans realize that if Ukraine falls apart and collapses during a presidential election year, the Mainstream media will craft the narrative as the \"GOP Lost Ukraine.\"\n\nBut who lost the Crimea a decade ago? Barack Obama. Getting away with Crimea, is what really emboldened Putin. He assumed he could grab more, and he tried in 2022.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda stressed on FOX News that, \"Support is indispensable for Ukraine.\"\n\nYet among the political miasma of Washington policymakers, few seem to notice the recent threat make by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Days after the U.S. Ukraine funding vote, Lavrov warned that the United States and NATO \"are teetering dangerously on the brink of a direct military clash between nuclear powers.\"\n\nIndeed. Now Ukraine must ramp up its own troop conscription to begin to offset Russia's numerical superiority. Kyiv passed a controversial new military conscription bill focusing on basic military training for those aged 18-25.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO can send Kyiv the weapons, but Ukraine must field the military forces to defend themselves.

Understandable. I think this pub was sold to community association or whatever by three owner or two/three owners in 1998/2000 when ti became clear they no longer could financially support something that was about to fall apart - its possible owners secured financing for emergency renovation from royals and took off with it by passing title onto locals.

China consumes some 14 million barrels a day of oil in peacetime.\n\nWhat does seem clear, however, is that China is deliberately stockpiling at speed, part of a much wider national effort to accumulate essential raw materials and resource.\n\nWhen it comes to energy, much of the new inflows now come primarily from Russia, whose energy exports to China rose by roughly one quarter last year to a record 2.14 million barrels per day.\n\nThat makes the Kremlin Beijing's largest energy supplier for the second year running, overtaking Saudi Arabia -- and allowing China to benefit from substantially discounted Russian oil as US and Western sanctions have turned away multiple other buyers since Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBeijing's stockpiling of oil is just one example of what appears a broad national effort to significantly increase the holdings of key raw materials. It is a move that some increasingly suspect is intended to help insulate Beijing against any future war or international sanctions, such as those that might be sparked by a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nIn a piece for international affairs and conflict blogging site \"War on the Rocks\" published on April 17, Mike Studeman, former commander of the US Office of Naval Intelligence and intelligence and director of the US Indo-Pacific Command, argued that this was part of a much wider process.\n\n\"Xi Jinping is preparing his country for a showdown,\" he wrote, describing the Chinese leader as \"militarising Chinese society and steeling his country for a potential high-intensity war.\"\n\nPart of that, he suggested, included building up strategic stockpiles of essential goods and resources, protecting China against the kind of sanctions imposed on Russia after its Ukraine invasion -- or, indeed, a militarily enforced blockade as part of a regional or global war.\n\nOther examples of heightened preparedness, he said, included the much higher tempo of Chinese military operations around Taiwan -- designed to both exercise China's military and implicitly threaten the government in Taipei with the consequences of its own total military blockade.\n\nUS officials say they believe Mr Xi has given his armed forces until 2027 to be prepared to invade Taiwan, although those inside and outside the US government remain divided on whether a decision to actually attack has genuinely been made.\n\nThis week, the outgoing head of the US Indo-Pacific Command said Beijing was continuing to plough resources into its military despite economic turmoil caused by a real estate crisis and a slump in US-China trade.\n\n\"Despite a failing economy, there is a conscious decision to fund military capability,\" Admiral John Aquilino told a naval conference in Japan. \"That's concerning to me.\"\n\nWhat is clear, Western experts and officials say, is that the government in Beijing has learned multiple lessons from Russia's troubled experience in Ukraine.\n\nThese include the desirability of managing any military takeover extremely quickly, presenting the outside world -- and particularly the US -- with a lightning change of government in Taiwan's capital Taipei before anyone can truly react.\n\nOver the last year, US President Joe Biden and counterpart Xi have held one relatively cordial meeting in California in November and at least one follow-on bilateral telephone call, while military officials have held direct meetings aimed at finding ways to ensure communication and reduce tensions in any future crisis.\n\nSo far, neither Washington nor other Western states have moved to significantly cut China off from raw materials, although the US has increasingly worked to strip Beijing of access to high-tech microchips, particularly those that could be used for weapons.\n\nEuropean states remain publicly divided over their approaches to Beijing, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting China this month in what appeared to be an effort to maintain ongoing trade links.\n\nGerman officials say Mr Scholz pressed Chinese counterparts including Mr Xi on multiple issues including human rights and Beijing's support for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nMore broadly, however, Western-Chinese relations continue to deteriorate -- and not just over Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province with which it vows to pursue \"reunification\" either peaceably or by force.\n\nThis month, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told fellow Nato foreign ministers that ever more Chinese components were being found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine. Beijing's support for Moscow, Mr Blinken said, was approaching the threshold of delivering lethal weapons systems.\n\nThis week also saw two rounds of arrests in Europe linked to alleged espionage by China, including two parliamentary researchers in Britain and three Germans working on defence programmes. China's embassies in both countries denied involvement in spying.\n\nHaving initially recovered following the Covid pandemic, US-Chinese trade nosedived in 2023 and so far shows little signs of recovering.\n\nOfficials in both the US and Europe also say they are considering introducing trade tariffs on Chinese production of electric vehicles in particular, accusing Beijing of deliberate overproduction in a way that threatens US and European rivals.\n\nShould such tariffs be introduced, relations would almost certainly deteriorate still further.\n\nChina's government buyers have never been ones to turn down a bargain, frequently building up their national stockpiles when short-term prices fall. Newly imposed Western sanctions on Russian nickel, aluminium and copper that entered force this month are seen as likely to spur further Chinese buying.\n\nWhen it comes to lithium, a vital component in many types of battery, Beijing has bought up not just stock but also processing facilities and mines, including overseas.\n\nIn March, investment bank UBS estimated that China might control a third of all global lithium supply as soon as 2025, again exploiting a price crash to further build its holdings.\n\nA US Geological Survey report from 2016 showed China's mineral deposits containing aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, iridium, tantalum, tin, tungsten, zinc and zirconium as well as other rare earth elements.\n\nSince then, China has sometimes sold off elements of its strategic reserves when prices have been particularly high, thereby reducing the costs for Chinese industry. More broadly, however, those stockpiles have continued to grow.\n\nWhen it comes to one particular commodity, those purchases appear to go well beyond the government. Chinese consumers and companies, as well as state institutions, have been on a particular buying spree this year for gold, pushing its global price to a record high above $2,400 (88,704 baht) an ounce.\n\nThat has prompted speculation that China is about to make a concerted effort to wean itself and other major emerging economies off their long-term dependence on the US dollar.\n\nBut it may also be a reflection that China's elite expect a more dangerous-feeling world over the rest of the 2020s and beyond, and would rather consolidate their wealth within Chinese borders well before that situation worsens.\u2009Reuters\n\nPeter Apps is a Reuters columnist writing on defence and security issues.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2024/04/29/5129700_700.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 452040241, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bae"}

Therefore, whether one is a long lost family member of Gautama Buddha (or Thaksin Shinawatra) makes no difference in spiritual potential, despite what Jesus said about rich men being barred from the kingdom of heaven.\n\nAnd surely telepathic phone calls with Vladimir Putin don't count for much either. By now the NOB should have SOPs from the flying saucer temple scam, the 747 flying-high monk debacle and hundreds of others, shouldn't they?\n\nIn summary all these scams are absurdly, self-evidently obvious.

What absurdly ridiculous lies!\n\nPlants produce oxygen and food by sequestering atmospheric CO2 which according to the phoney theory that CO2 is bad should be good right? But in the twisted reasoning of anti-human climate crazy Lisa Jarvis, plants are bad because according to an expert, \"Pollen is a really clear example of how climate change is with us here and now, in our backyards and already affecting our health\".\n\nWestern medicine intentionally confuses the relief of symptoms and the cause of disease due to profit motivation. Allergens such as pollen are said to \"cause\" an allergic reaction. But what is the root cause of allergic disease?\n\nQuite simply it is a weakened and unbalanced immune system. The immune system fails to mature due to a lack of environmental stimulation, and instead allergic and autoimmune diseases develop. One of the principal causes for the increase in allergic disease is insufficient exposure to natural environments. A child who grows up in a city, eats packaged food, wears a mask, is lathered in disinfectant at every turn, and interacts with few animals, little dirt and no sunshine is at high risk of suffering allergic disease.\n\nLastly, the economic losses which the author falsely attributes to climate change are claimed to be in the billions. In fact, to achieve \"net zero\" has been reliably estimated to cost more than US$4 trillion.\n\nI see Michael Setter has been on his favourite websites again.\n\nNot only does he think there is no evidence of \"rapid climate change\", but he believes that the recent record rainfall in the Middle East was down to \"Iranian drones\".\n\nThen he tells us about \" satellite-born, ultra-high energy discharge devices that cause fires and earthquakes\".\n\nAre these the \"Jewish space lasers\" of which a certain wacky US politician spoke?\n\nI can only (hopefully) assume the Postbag Editor allows these posts through for entertainment value.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20240429/c1_2783680_240429053030_700.jpg", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 452040202, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657baf"}

It's a pleasing self-image: plucky little New Zealand wheeling and dealing to pay our way in the world, championed by wise Helen Clark, wily John Key, charismatic Jacinda Ardern and now jolly Christopher Luxon.\n\nBut our trade as a percentage of GDP is below the OECD average and significantly lower than that of other small, open, liberal democracies. This measure was flat for 30 years; it's been in decline for the past 10, despite our free trade deal with China. Signed back in 2008, open access to the world's fastest-growing economy with its huge population has kept our noses above the waterline. Just.\n\nBut China's post-Covid economic slowdown, accompanied by tensions with the West, are complicating the relationship. The ominous geopolitics and our desperate need to grow and diversify our export markets were the backdrop to Luxon's recent visits to Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines and his interest in engaging with Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\nThere were two grand assumptions baked into the West's engagement with China. The first was comparative advantage. As nations open their markets to one another, each will have strengths and weaknesses in different sectors - so both are better off taking advantage of each other's expertise and resources, producing more than they could in isolation. The second assumption was liberalisation: capitalism requires the free flow of information, so as the world's second-largest nation's markets developed, it would have to allow independent media and freedom of speech. This would lead, gently but inexorably, to democratisation. Selling baby formula in Shenzhen would usher China into the End of History.\n\nBut China has not liberalised. Its paramount leader, Xi Jinping, has abolished the traditional term limits for his job and concentrated political power in his own position.\n\nUnder his leadership, China has adopted a policy of mass detention of Uyghurs and other Muslims in its western provinces and cracked down on democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nIn early 2022, it announced a \"no limits partnership\" with Russia immediately before Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2016, three US economists published a landmark paper describing \"the China shock\": calling the comparative-advantage theory of free trade into doubt. It showed that the loss of manufacturing jobs to China hit the US hard, causing \"higher unemployment, lower labour force participation, and reduced wages in local labour markets\".\n\nSubsequent studies have shown similar results for European economies engaging with China. The West appears to have enriched an emerging superpower which has values antithetical to its own while inflicting enormous damage on its own economies.\n\nSo our traditional allies are backing away from China for geopolitical and economic reasons. This is the backdrop to the debate around Aukus, the new tripartite defence agreement between Australia, the US and the UK. The core component, Pillar 1, involves transferring nuclear propulsion technology to Australia, enhancing the deterrence capabilities of that country's submarine fleet in the Indo-Pacific region. But Pillar 2 will involve the sharing and development of cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies and additional undersea capabilities alongside a deep-space radar programme.\n\nLuxon expressed his interest in joining during a state visit to Australia late last year. China warns that the agreement reflects a \"Cold War mentality\" that may damage peace in the region - but it also conducted a cyberattack on our Parliament in 2021.\n\nNew Zealand's foreign affairs, defence and intelligence establishment is always desperately eager to involve us with our traditional allies (some politicians complain of a culture of \"attaboyism\" among our senior officials, who seem more interested in pleasing Canberra and Washington than in advancing New Zealand's interests). Helen Clark, a staunch critic of Aukus, notes that \"blocs that shared New Zealand's democratic values, like the US, the UK, the European Union and India, had very rarely opened themselves up to trading with New Zealand.\"\n\nThere's also the question of the US's strategic judgment - its tendency to blunder into bloody and catastrophic military adventures is not an ideal quality in an ally - and the dysfunctionality of its domestic politics. What happens if we irritate China by signing up to Aukus and a re-elected Donald Trump simply rips the agreement up?\n\nForeign policy under the previous Labour government was not very consistent. In the first term, then-foreign minister Winston Peters announced a \"Pacific reset\", focusing on our near neighbours in the region. Under Covid, we became the \"smug hermit kingdom\", as John Key put it, and when we opened up again, Ardern's focus was on the US and Europe. Foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta promoted an \"indigenous foreign policy\" that mostly involved staying in New Zealand. Now, we're desperately scrambling for new export markets because we're entering into a new and still vague military alliance against our most important trading partner.\n\nLuxon has told his diplomats and trade officials he wants upgrades to existing agreements with Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines within two years. He's formed a foreign affairs group of ministers - Peters, Trade Minister Todd McClay and Defence Minister Judith Collins - to drive the work.\n\nLabour was cautiously supportive of Aukus when it was in government but is more sceptical in opposition. It recently hosted a discussion at Parliament, at which Clark aired her reservations and former Australian foreign minister Bob Carr attacked Pillar 2 as \"fragrant, methane-wrapped bullshit\".\n\nIt's hard to know how serious this is: in 2017, Labour led a massive protest campaign against the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement then reversed its position a few weeks after forming a government. When it's back in power, our trade and defence policies may pivot yet again. A real trading nation would treat both issues more seriously.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/VOR4BOPRAJFO7C2MCSWRVGCRZU.jpg?auth=0899be4318d6561aed496e89f80411f8ba5c45ec4b8130c6a4b67618486edce6&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452039397, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bb1"}

The U.S. opposes the invasion on humanitarian grounds, straining relations between the allies. Israel is among the countries U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit as he returns to the Middle East on Monday.\n\nBiden also stressed that progress in delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza be \"sustained and enhanced,\" according to the statement. The call lasted just under an hour, and they agreed the onus remains on Hamas to accept the latest offer in negotiations, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to comment publicly. There was no comment from Netanyahu's office.\n\nA senior official from key intermediary Qatar, meanwhile, urged Israel and Hamas to show \"more commitment and more seriousness\" in negotiations. Qatar, which hosts Hamas' headquarters in Doha, was instrumental along with the U.S. and Egypt in helping negotiate a brief halt to the fighting in November that led to the release of dozens of hostages. But in a sign of frustration, Qatar this month said that it was reassessing its role.\n\nAn Israeli delegation is expected in Egypt in the coming days to discuss the latest proposals in negotiations, and senior Hamas official Basem Naim said in a message to The Associated Press that a delegation from the militant group will also head to Cairo. Egypt's state-owned Al Qahera News satellite television channel said that the delegation would arrive on Monday.\n\nArrests roil campuses nationwide ahead of graduation as protesters demand Israel ties be cut\n\nProtests are roiling college campuses nationwide as administrators with graduation ceremonies next month face demands that schools cut financial ties to Israel against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nMany campuses were largely quiet by early afternoon Sunday, but about 275 people were arrested on Saturday at campuses including Indiana University at Bloomington, Arizona State University and Washington University in St. Louis. Those have pushed the number of arrests nationwide to nearly 900 since New York police removed a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at Columbia University and arrested more than 100 demonstrators on April 18.\n\nSince then, students have dug in at dozens of pro-Palestinian encampments around the country, prompting a range of responses from administrators: arrests and criminal charges, student suspensions or simply continued pleas to leave. The plight of students has become a central part of protests, with both the students and a growing number of faculty demanding amnesty. At issue is whether the suspensions and legal records will follow students through their adult lives.\n\nFaculty members at universities in California, Georgia and Texas have initiated or passed largely symbolic votes of no confidence in their leadership.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said President Joe Biden \"knows that there are very strong feelings\" but would leave managing the protests to local authorities.\n\nHave you heard the one about Trump? Biden tries humor on the campaign trail\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is out to win votes by scoring some laughs at the expense of Donald Trump, unleashing mockery with the goal of getting under the former president's thin skin and reminding the country of his blunders.\n\nLike a comic honing his routine, the Democratic president has been testing and expanding his jokes over the past few weeks. It started with jabs about his Republican opponent's financial problems, and now Biden regularly pokes fun at Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and his attempt to make a few extra bucks by selling a special edition of the Bible.\n\nThe jokes are the latest attempt to crack the code on how to clap back at Trump, whose own insult comedy schtick has redrawn the boundaries of what is acceptable in modern politics. Few have had much luck, whether they try to take the high road or get down and dirty with Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\n\"This is a constant challenge,\" said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama. Trump is \"not someone who plays by the rules. So it's up to Biden to figure out how to adapt and play by new rules of engagement.\"\n\nSo far, Biden has been trying to thread a delicate needle to boost his chances of a second term. He uses humor to paint Trump as a buffoon unworthy of the Oval Office, but the president stops short of turning the election into a laughing matter.\n\nDonald Trump is running against Joe Biden. But he keeps bringing up another Democrat: Jimmy Carter\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- As Donald Trump campaigns for a return to the White House, he often reaches back more than 40 years and seven administrations to belittle President Joe Biden by comparing him to 99-year-old Jimmy Carter.\n\nMost recently, Trump used his first campaign stop after the start of his criminal hush money trial in New York to needle the 46th president by saying the 39th president, a recently widowed hospice patient who left office in 1981, was selfishly pleased with Biden's record.\n\n\"Biden is the worst president in the history of our country, worse than Jimmy Carter by a long shot,\" Trump said in a variation of a quip he has used throughout the 2024 campaign, including as former first lady Rosalynn Carter was on her deathbed. \"Jimmy Carter is happy,\" Trump continued about the two Democrats, \"because he had a brilliant presidency compared to Biden.\"\n\nIt was once common for Republicans like Trump to lampoon Carter. Many Democrats, including Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, kept their distance for years, too, after a roiled economy, energy shortages and an extended American hostage crisis led to Carter's landslide defeat in 1980. The negative vibes waned, though, with the passage of time and reconsideration of Carter's legacy as a political leader, Nobel laureate and global humanitarian.\n\nThat leaves some observers, Democrats especially, questioning Trump's attempts to saddle Biden with the decades-old baggage of a frail man who closed his public life last November by silently leading the mourning for his wife of 77 years.\n\nTornadoes kill 4 in Oklahoma, leaving trail of destruction and thousands without power\n\nSULPHUR, Okla. (AP) -- Tornadoes killed four people in Oklahoma and left thousands without power Sunday after a destructive outbreak of severe weather flattened buildings in the heart of one rural town and injured at least 100 people across the state.\n\nMore than 20,000 people remained without electricity after tornadoes began late Saturday night. The destruction was extensive in Sulphur, a town of about 5,000 people, where a tornado crumpled many downtown buildings, tossed cars and buses and sheared the roofs off houses across a 15-block radius.\n\n\"You just can't believe the destruction,\" Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said during a visit to the hard-hit town. \"It seems like every business downtown has been destroyed.\"\n\nStitt said about 30 people were injured alone in Sulphur, including some who were in a bar as the tornado struck. Hospitals across the state reported about 100 injuries, including people apparently cut or struck by debris or hurt from falls, according to the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management.\n\nThe deadly weather in Oklahoma added to the dozens of reported tornadoes that wreaked havoc in the nation's midsection since Friday. On Sunday, authorities in Iowa said a man injured during a tornado that hit the town of Minden on Friday had died, according to local reports.\n\nPutin likely didn't order death of Russian opposition leader Navalny, US official says\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely didn't order the death of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny in February, according to an official familiar with the determination.\n\nWhile U.S. officials believe Putin was ultimately responsible for the death of Navalny, who endured brutal conditions during his confinement, the intelligence community has found \"no smoking gun\" that Putin was aware of the timing of Navalny's death -- which came soon before the Russian president's reelection -- or directly ordered it, according to the official.\n\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.\n\nSoon after Navalny's death, U.S. President Joe Biden said Putin was ultimately responsible but did not accuse the Russian president of directly ordering it.\n\nAt the time, Biden said the U.S. did not know exactly what had happened to Navalny but that \"there is no doubt\" that his death \"was the consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did.\"\n\nPassage of harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law in Iraq draws diplomatic backlash\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) -- Human rights groups and diplomats criticized a law that was quietly passed by the Iraqi parliament over the weekend that would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that the law passed Saturday \"threatens those most at risk in Iraqi society\" and \"can be used to hamper free-speech and expression.\" He warned that the legislation could drive away foreign investment.\n\n\"International business coalitions have already indicated that such discrimination in Iraq will harm business and economic growth in the country,\" the statement said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Cameron called the law \"dangerous and worrying.\"\n\nAlthough homosexuality is taboo in the largely conservative Iraqi society, and political leaders have periodically launched anti-LGBTQ+ campaigns, Iraq did not previously have a law that explicitly criminalized it.\n\nAfrican farmers look to the past and the future to address climate change\n\nHARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- From ancient fertilizer methods in Zimbabwe to new greenhouse technology in Somalia, farmers across the heavily agriculture-reliant African continent are looking to the past and future to respond to climate change.\n\nAfrica, with the world's youngest population, faces the worst effects of a warming planet while contributing the least to the problem. Farmers are scrambling to make sure the booming population is fed.\n\nWith over 60% of the world's uncultivated land, Africa should be able to feed itself, some experts say. And yet three in four people across the continent cannot afford a healthy diet, according to a report last year by the African Union and United Nations agencies. Reasons include conflict and lack of investment.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, where the El Nino phenomenon has worsened a drought, small-scale farmer James Tshuma has lost hope of harvesting anything from his fields. It's a familiar story in much of the country, where the government has declared a $2 billion state of emergency and millions of people face hunger.\n\nBut a patch of green vegetables is thriving in a small garden the 65-year-old Tshuma is keeping alive with homemade organic manure and fertilizer. Previously discarded items have again become priceless.\n\nObstacles remain as women seek more leadership roles in America's Black Church\n\nNo woman had ever preached the keynote sermon at the Joint National Baptist Convention, a gathering of four historically Black Baptist denominations representing millions of people.\n\nThat changed in January when the Rev. Gina Stewart took the convention stage in Memphis, Tennessee, -- the Southern city home to Christ Missionary Baptist Church where she serves as senior pastor -- and delivered a rousing message, asserting that Jesus not only included women in his ministry, but identified with their suffering.\n\nBut what happened next put a spotlight on the obstacles women in Christian ministry continue to face as they carve out leadership space within the patriarchal culture of the Black Church in America. Several women pastors told The Associated Press that it should serve as the breaking point.\n\n\"This is an example of no matter how high you rise as a woman, you're going to meet patriarchy at the top of the hill,\" said Martha Simmons, founder of Women of Color in Ministry, which helps women navigate the process of getting ordained. \"The next Norton Anthology of African American preaching is probably 20 years away, but that sermon will be in there.\"\n\nDespite the enthusiastic reception for Stewart, the original recording of her historic sermon disappeared from the convention's Facebook page, setting off a social media firestorm - driven mostly by women - protesting its removal. A recording of the sermon later appeared, but it was followed by accusations the convention edited her closing remarks, which challenges the four allied denominations to support women in ministry.\n\nCandace Parker, a 3-time WNBA champion and 2-time Olympic gold medalist, announces retirement\n\nCandace Parker always said she'd know when it would be time to retire. That day came Sunday.\n\nThe three-time WNBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist announced on social media that her career was over after 16 seasons.\n\n\"The competitor in me always wants 1 more, but it's time,\" Parker wrote in an Instagram post. \"My HEART & body knew, but I needed to give my mind time to accept it.\"\n\nParker, 38, had told The Associated Press in November she wanted to play another season if she could get healthy from a foot injury that kept her off the court last season. But she cautioned that she didn't want to \"cheat the game,\" or herself, and expressed the same in announcing her retirement ahead of the Aces' attempt to win a third title in a row. Parker has had 10 surgeries over her career.\n\n\"I promised I'd never cheat the game & that I'd leave it in a better place than I came into it. ... I always wanted to walk off the court with no parade or tour, just privately with the ones I love,\" she wrote. \"What now was to be my last game, I walked off the court with my daughter.

The arrest came after the Basmanny District Court of Moscow granted authorities the petition of the preliminary investigation.\n\nAccording to the investigations, Kurbonov was responsible for providing funds for the preparation of the attack, as well as providing members of an organized group with telecommunications means and systematically paying for them. He was charged under paragraph 3.b of Article 205, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe incident, for which ISIS claimed responsibility, marked the deadliest terrorist attack Russia has witnessed in the past two decades, and occurred days after President Vladimir Putin extended his rule of more than two decades. The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) initially arrested a dozen people and detained 3 more men on April 4 in connection to the attack. The charges against the detainees included recruiting individuals to assist in the attack, funding the operation and purchasing firearms and vehicles used in the attack.\n\nFollowing the attack, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation demanded extradition from Ukraine of all individuals involved in the Moscow concert hall attack and other terrorist attacks, such as the bombing of the Crimean Bridge in October 2022, after it claimed an investigation conducted by Russian authorities showed that the incident was connected to Ukraine.

Besides Jack, who was Trump's political director during his administration and worked for then-U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they included former state senators Mike Crane and Mike Dugan, former state Rep. Philip Singleton and party activist Jim Bennett.\n\nThey're seeking to replace Republican U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson, who is stepping down. The district hugs the Alabama border from Carrollton to Columbus and swings east into the Atlanta suburbs of Newnan and Peachtree City.\n\nJack repeatedly referenced his work in the Trump administration, promising that in Congress he would continue that work.\n\n\"To sell myself, I think that I will look at the record of accomplishment and success that we had and we delivered in that administration,\" Jack said.\n\nOthers largely passed on the chance to attack Jack, although Crane suggested that McCarthy is the one trying to anoint Jack, asking voters who should choose their representative.\n\n\"Do you want to take responsibility for that vote or do you want to let Washington, D.C., insiders do what they've done for the last several cycles, and that is choose the next representative for the 3rd District?\" Crane asked.\n\nBut attacks on Jack, the fundraising leader in the race, were mostly muted. Crane, Bennett and Singleton staked out more conservative positions, with each saying they would join the Freedom Caucus if elected.\n\nSingleton was often at odds with GOP leadership during his time in the state House, attacking then-Speaker David Ralston's leadership, with top Republicans then drawing Singleton into a majority Democratic district. Singleton, though, said he's \"not an oppositional guy.\"\n\n\"You go and you fight for the principles that you believe in, you stand for,\" Singleton said. \"I'm not someone that fights against people. I fight for good policy.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether human embryos should have the same rights as people, Jack echoed Trump's position that restrictions on reprodutive rights should be left to the states. Dugan noted he voted for Georgia's current abortion restrictions, which ban abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected. That's typically after about six weeks, often before a woman knows she is pregnant.\n\nBut Dugan said restriction of in vitro fertilization was \"a deeper question,\" not saying clearly how he would vote.\n\nThe other three, though, voiced no doubts about implementing a legal standard that could lead to a total ban on abortion in Georgia and a ban on in vitro fertilization as currently practiced.\n\n\"I'm against recreational abortion,\" Bennett said. \"I believe that life does exist from the moment of conception. There's no wiggle room for me.\"\n\nAll of the candidates, in a show of hands, said they believed Trump was the rightful winner of Georgia's 16 electoral votes in 2020, despite no reliable evidence to contradict Democrat Joe Biden's win. Several said they believed Republican-backed changes to Georgia's election laws since then made them more at ease, but Bennett attacked the continued use of Dominion ballot marking devices, echoing a common belief among Republican activists that all voting machines should be distrusted.\n\nAll of the candidates voiced support for more restrictions on immigration, with several including Jack saying they support mass deportations of people who have entered the country illegally. Jack said he would have voted against the recent foreign aid package to Ukraine, Israel and others until he was satisfied on border security.\n\nDugan said he believed Republicans were right to reject a proposed bill on border security that the Biden administration had backed.\n\n\"I don't think anybody trusted Joe Biden to secure our southern border,\" Dugan said.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/preview-2408.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520974", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 452044602, "relevance": 3, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bb8"}

But, really, it came down to only two men: Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nWashington's annual mashup of political humor and earnest paeans to the free press is typically a good-natured collection of one-liners and affectionate jabs at friends and enemies alike. But it was the leading 2024 presidential contenders who loomed largest - one in the Washington Hilton hotel ballroom, the other who definitely, positively, probably was not watching from Mar-a-Lago. Unless, of course, he was.\n\n\"The 2024 election is in full swing and, yes, age is an issue,\" President Biden told the black-tie crowd. \"I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.\"\n\n\"Can we just acknowledge how refreshing it is,\" comedian Colin Jost later added, \"to see a president of the United States at an event that doesn't begin with a bailiff saying, 'All rise!'\"\n\nFor most of the evening, Trump ignored the dinner and posted instead about presidential immunity and political witch hunts. Shortly after 1 a.m., he finally chimed in on Truth Social: \"The White House Correspondents' Dinner was really bad. Colin Jost BOMBED, and Crooked Joe was an absolute disaster! Doesn't get much worse than this!\"\n\nSo, basically, another day on the campaign trail.\n\nBut for the denizens of Washington's political media, it was a special occasion. The correspondents' dinner is ostensibly a playful celebration of the codependent relationship between Washington politicians and reporters who spend the rest of the year covering them and deadly serious issues: Trump's legal trials, looming uncertainty about what will happen in November (and beyond), the Ukraine war, the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIt proved hard to put all that aside for the night. Especially Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protesters surrounded the entrance outside of the hotel, shouting chants such as, \"Western media, you can't hide! We charge you with genocide!\" and confronting guests arriving to the dinner in their tuxedos and gowns. Some attendees were followed by tight circles of protesters yelling \"Shame!\" inches from their faces until they could get behind police.\n\n\"I came in through a different entrance, so I didn't hear exactly what they are chanting,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), running up an escalator to the lobby. \"But there are tens of thousands of people being blown to bits in Gaza, so I understand why they are protesting. I stand with the movement - depending on what they are saying.\"\n\nThe experience of walking the gantlet of activists seemed to have left a lot of people somewhat stunned. But inside the ballroom, it was all smiles and hugs and back slaps.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) charmed everyone, wearing a big smile and a \"FREE EVAN\" pin in honor of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter imprisoned in Russia. Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) gave a report on his own encounter with the protesters outside: \"I asked them about what was happening in Sudan. And they yelled louder. And then I asked them about the concentration camps full of Uyghurs. And they yelled louder. And then I went inside.\" Olivia Nuzzi, a political reporter for New York Magazine, got off a presidential zinger of her own: \"I can't hear a thing in here - I feel like Biden.\"\n\nBiden's own zingers were directed almost entirely at his opponent.\n\n\"Trump's so desperate, he started reading those Bibles he's selling,\" the president said. \"Then he got to the First Commandment: 'You shall have no other gods before me.' That's when he put it down and said, 'This book's not for me.'\"\n\nBut the president soon dispensed with the yuks and pivoted to what felt like a stump speech about the clear and present danger posed by Trump and his movement. He called on the journalists in the room to report \"truth over lies.\" He implored them to move past the election horse race stories and focus on American democracy. \"The stakes couldn't be higher,\" he said. No punchline.\n\nOfficially, the evening is nonpartisan, and the only toast of the night goes to the sitting president, regardless of party affiliation. Unofficially, the dinner has always been perceived as a hotbed of Washington elites who lean left, regardless of media affiliation.\n\nTrump, who was famously roasted by President Barack Obama at the 2011 dinner, never attended the event as president. His relentless criticism of the mainstream media caused many news organizations to threaten a boycott of the dinner in 2017; Trump announced that he would not attend. He skipped two following years and even counterprogrammed with a MAGA rally instead. The party soldiered on, reinforcing a commitment to the role of a free press in a democracy, and many breathed a not-so-discreet sigh of relief when the crowd resumed in 2022 after the worst of the pandemic with Biden carrying the torch.\n\nThe only Trump spotted at this year's festivities was daughter-in-law Lara Trump, recently crowned co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Her father-in-law wasn't in the building, but comic impressionist Matt Friend emerged from the crowd with a Trump impersonation - as well as sendups of Bernie Sanders, Mitch McConnell and Obama. He also made the first (and, surprisingly, only) dead-dog joke of the night.\n\n\"I am killing this dinner harder than Kristi Noem kills the puppies,\" Friend said in his Trump voice, riffing off the news that the Republican governor of South Dakota, in a forthcoming book, admits to shooting her 14-month-old dog because she was \"untrainable\" and aggressive.\n\nLet's face it: It's a tough room for a comedian. Jost, co-anchor of \"Saturday Night Live's\" \"Weekend Update,\" sat at the head table next to the president and nearby first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and WHCA President Kelly O'Donnell, senior White House correspondent for NBC News. His speech came after Biden's and felt like one of his SNL bits: Some jokes got laughs, others landed awkwardly.\n\nThere were a few jabs at Biden, a \"decent\" man who Jost said reminds him of his beloved grandfather, a Staten Island firefighter. There were also some uneven one-liners about the press, but the press never laughs at itself, so it's hard to know whether they were good or bad jokes.\n\nJost took several swipes at the former president, too: \"I love that Trump's two attacks on Biden are that he's a senile old man and a criminal mastermind. I think you've got to pick one. Personally, I don't know any criminal masterminds who bike to get ice cream.\" On the courtroom drawings that have emerged from the trials: \"Every sketch of Trump looks like the Grinch had sex with the Lorax.\"\n\nJost brought the evening's most glamorous celebrity: movie star Scarlett Johansson, whom he married in 2020. What started a century ago as an annual gathering of reporters and their subjects morphed into the \"Nerd Prom\" about 35 years ago - a red carpet extravaganza where news organizations battle to host administration officials, Hollywood A-listers, corporate heavyweights and anyone else basking in their 15 minutes of fame. Within the throngs are a few people who actually work as White House correspondents.\n\nWith some exceptions, this year's guest list fell solidly into B-list territory: Jon Hamm, Chris Pine, Keri Russell, Molly Ringwald, Rosario Dawson, Jon Cryer, Caitlyn Jenner, Billy Porter, Lorne Michaels.\n\nBefore the speeches, the WHCA handed out its awards for excellence. The award for overall excellence went to Barak Ravid of Axios, Peter Baker of the New York Times received the print award for deadline reporting, and Tamara Keith of NPR received the broadcast award in the same category - all singled out for stories following Hamas's Oct. 7 attack in Israel. Doug Mills of the Times got the award for visual journalism for a striking photo of Biden, and the award for courage and accountability went to The Washington Post for coverage on the impact of assault rifles and mass shootings.\n\nThe evening ended, as it always does: with an impassioned defense of democracy and the critical role of the press in preserving it.\n\nJost had his own thoughts about the media. \"Your words speak truth to power. Your words bring light to the darkness.\" Then he paused and grinned, \"And most importantly, your words train the AI programs that will soon replace you.\"\n\nBiden ended with a toast of his own: \"To a free press. To an informed citizenry. To an America where freedom and democracy endure. God bless America.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/28/PDTN/73494894007-correspondents-j-3-pv-7-iolqtjwhe-6-wb-6-pgwqwow-4.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3497,1968,x0,y304&format=pjpg&width=1200", "eventUri": "eng-9519637", "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 452044548, "relevance": 6, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bb9"}

During the 2016 primary, Trump mocked the appearance of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's wife. Trump also helped spread a false story that Cruz's father passed out Fidel Castro pamphlets with Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed President John F.

That means schools that separate boys' and girls' locker rooms, bathrooms, and sports teams (more on that in a moment) teams will potentially lose their funding.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to universities, where the students are adults, but all the way down into the K-12 system, forcing minor girls to have to share any previously single-sex facility with biological males.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it intends to carve out sports for a separate rulemaking later on - read: after the election - but this is the most transparent of political fig leaves. The plain language of the rule tells schools that treating a boy as a boy is forbidden.\n\nAnd while Biden officials claim to have separated out sports for special treatment, likely because of the popularity of state laws ensuring fair single-sex competition in their tracks and pools, the administration has already behaved the exact opposite in federal court.\n\nThe federal government filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit asserting explicitly that West Virginia's state law keeping women's sports female-only is a violation of Title IX.\n\nIf nothing is done to reverse these changes to Title IX, either by successful challenges in court or through Congress and the democratic process, telling Lia Thomas he must compete against his fellow men will likely be \"illegal\" when these regulations go into effect on Aug. 1.\n\nEven worse, schools will have an obligation to punish what federal law will now consider illegal discrimination, which means that any brave girls who speak out or refuse to compete with biological males will be potentially subject to sanction, lest the school lose federal funding.\n\nBut twisting a women's rights statute into a weapon to take away girls' privacy, opportunities, and safety isn't even the end of the new Title IX changes. The rule also reverses due process protections for college students put in place by the Trump administration, ensuring procedural fairness guarantees like the right to an unbiased adjudicator, the right to know the specifics of what you're accused of committing, and the right to representation.\n\nHundreds of young men have vindicated these basic due process rights in federal courts, but the Biden administration is now greenlighting a return to kangaroo courts on campus for those accused of sexual misconduct. It's worth pointing out that Joe Biden himself did not submit to the kind of Star Chamber hearing he's demanding for college students when accused of sexual assault by Tara Reade.\n\nFinally, the new regulations also make worrying incursions into what courts have clearly defined as protected speech. First, because the rule defines treating someone as the sex they actually are as discrimination, it potentially encourages schools to punish even minor students who \"misgender\" a fellow. Second, the rule returns to an unconstitutionally vague Obama-era definition of what constitutes \"harassment,\" opening the door to sweep in all kinds of subjectively offensive speech.\n\nEach of these changes alone would constitute a five-alarm fire. Put them together and you have a massive regulatory overreach affecting the lives and constitutional rights of millions of Americans.\n\nAll this from a statute that merely bans discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in educational institutions that take federal funds. The executive branch and unelected bureaucrats do not have the power to singlehandedly rewrite civil rights law, and turn the plain meaning of Title IX on its head, eliminating protections for both women's and men's rights with the stroke of a pen.\n\nFortunately, the current Supreme Court has been more skeptical of this very kind of uncontrolled agency power, which circumvents the democratic process and separation of powers. Independent Women's Law Center is proud to be one of the many organizations that will no doubt challenge these unconstitutional regulations, and states like Louisiana and Florida have already announced that they will not be complying, launching their own cases in court.\n\nUltimately, though, what can be done by the \"pen and the phone\" can be undone the same way by a new chief executive, or Congress can exercise its powers under the Congressional Review Act to reverse these regulations.\n\nIn the meantime, the ability of women and girls to safely participate in their educations, and the constitutional rights of students, teachers, and professors alike, hang in the balance as we get closer to the election in November.\n\nInez Stepman is a senior policy analyst at Independent Women's Forum (iwf.org) and the host of High Noon podcast.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "image": null, "eventUri": "eng-9521113", "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 452044326, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bbc"}

The Padres haven't seemed to recover from blowing a late five-run lead at Colorado on Thursday and losing 10-9. Although they briefly had the lead Sunday, the Padres lost their season-high fourth straight game.\n\nWalker (1-0) opened the season on the injured list with right shoulder soreness and was activated earlier Sunday from a rehab assignment. He pitched into the seventh after Aaron Nola and Ranger Su\u00e1rez each went eight innings in the first two games.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Walker also allowed Jake Cronenworth's two-run shot in the third. The right-hander allowed six runs and eight hits, struck out four and walked two.\n\nJos\u00e9 Alvarado pitched a perfect ninth for his fifth save in as many opportunities.\n\nStott, the No. 8 hitter, had his first career multiple-homer game. He connected with one out in the second for a 2-0 lead and again with two outs in the fourth for a 4-3 lead. Stott has three this season. Nick Castellanos walked ahead of Stott both times.\n\nRealmuto hit a two-run homer in the sixth, his second of the series and fifth overall. All three homers Sunday came off Michael King (2-3). Realmuto added an RBI single in the seventh.\n\nIn between Stott's homers, Walker made his slick catch and blew the lead. With Xander Bogaerts aboard on a leadoff single in the second, rookie Jackson Merrill hit a shot back to the mound on a curveball and Walker turned slightly and reached behind his back to make the catch. He then doubled Bogaerts off first. Merrill looked perplexed as he took off his helmet and headed back to the dugout.\n\nWalker surrendered the lead in the third on Fernando Tatis Jr.'s RBI double and Cronenworth's two-run homer, his fourth.\n\nStott regained the lead for Walker and the Phillies with his fourth-inning homer.\n\nKing allowed six runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings, struck out six and walked three.\n\nROSTER MOVE\n\nTo make room for Walker, RHP Ricardo Pinto was designated for assignment.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (1-3, 2.96 ERA) is scheduled to start Monday night in the opener of a three-game series at the Los Angeles Angels, who will counter with RHP Griffin Canning (1-3, 7.50).\n\nPadres: RHP Matt Waldron (1-2, 3.96) is set to start Monday night in the opener of a three-game series against LHP Nick Lodolo (2-0, 2.12) and the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nPhiladelphiaABRHBIBBSOAvg.Schwarber dh512001.200Turner ss501001.339Harper 1b400011.234Bohm 3b513001.365Realmuto c512302.245Marsh lf401002.291Castellanos rf120030.179Stott 2b332400.226Rojas cf401100.250Totals36812848\n\nSan DiegoABRHBIBBSOAvg.Profar lf412010.303Tatis rf411100.244Cronenworth 1b412200.264Machado 3b401000.252Bogaerts 2b401001.213Merrill cf400000.295Kim ss310011.220Pauley dh311001.143b-Rosario ph100001.273Higashioka c200001.174a-Campusano ph-c211301.290Totals3569626\n\nPhiladelphia020202110 -- 8121San Diego003000300 -- 690\n\na-homered for Higashioka in the 7th. b-struck out for Pauley in the 9th.\n\nE -- Bohm (5).

That means schools that separate boys' and girls' locker rooms, bathrooms, and sports teams (more on that in a moment) teams will potentially lose their funding. (RELATED: SHEA BRADLEY-FARRELL: Jill Biden Promises To Help Women -- Don't Trust The Deception)\n\nThis doesn't just apply to universities, where the students are adults, but all the way down into the K-12 system, forcing minor girls to have to share any previously single-sex facility with biological males.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it intends to carve out sports for a separate rulemaking later on - read: after the election - but this is the most transparent of political fig leaves. The plain language of the rule tells schools that treating a boy as a boy is forbidden.\n\nAnd while Biden officials claim to have separated out sports for special treatment, likely because of the popularity of state laws ensuring fair single-sex competition in their tracks and pools, the administration has already behaved the exact opposite in federal court.\n\nThe federal government filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit asserting explicitly that West Virginia's state law keeping women's sports female-only is a violation of Title IX.\n\nIf nothing is done to reverse these changes to Title IX, either by successful challenges in court or through Congress and the democratic process, telling Lia Thomas he must compete against his fellow men will likely be \"illegal\" when these regulations go into effect on Aug. 1.\n\nEven worse, schools will have an obligation to punish what federal law will now consider illegal discrimination, which means that any brave girls who speak out or refuse to compete with biological males will be potentially subject to sanction, lest the school lose federal funding.\n\nBut twisting a women's rights statute into a weapon to take away girls' privacy, opportunities, and safety isn't even the end of the new Title IX changes. The rule also reverses due process protections for college students put in place by the Trump administration, ensuring procedural fairness guarantees like the right to an unbiased adjudicator, the right to know the specifics of what you're accused of committing, and the right to representation.\n\nHundreds of young men have vindicated these basic due process rights in federal courts, but the Biden administration is now greenlighting a return to kangaroo courts on campus for those accused of sexual misconduct. It's worth pointing out that Joe Biden himself did not submit to the kind of Star Chamber hearing he's demanding for college students when accused of sexual assault by Tara Reade.\n\nFinally, the new regulations also make worrying incursions into what courts have clearly defined as protected speech. First, because the rule defines treating someone as the sex they actually are as discrimination, it potentially encourages schools to punish even minor students who \"misgender\" a fellow. Second, the rule returns to an unconstitutionally vague Obama-era definition of what constitutes \"harassment,\" opening the door to sweep in all kinds of subjectively offensive speech.\n\nEach of these changes alone would constitute a five-alarm fire. Put them together and you have a massive regulatory overreach affecting the lives and constitutional rights of millions of Americans.\n\nAll this from a statute that merely bans discrimination \"on the basis of sex\" in educational institutions that take federal funds. The executive branch and unelected bureaucrats do not have the power to singlehandedly rewrite civil rights law, and turn the plain meaning of Title IX on its head, eliminating protections for both women's and men's rights with the stroke of a pen.\n\nFortunately, the current Supreme Court has been more skeptical of this very kind of uncontrolled agency power, which circumvents the democratic process and separation of powers. Independent Women's Law Center is proud to be one of the many organizations that will no doubt challenge these unconstitutional regulations, and states like Louisiana and Florida have already announced that they will not be complying, launching their own cases in court.\n\nUltimately, though, what can be done by the \"pen and the phone\" can be undone the same way by a new chief executive, or Congress can exercise its powers under the Congressional Review Act to reverse these regulations.\n\nIn the meantime, the ability of women and girls to safely participate in their educations, and the constitutional rights of students, teachers, and professors alike, hang in the balance as we get closer to the election in November.\n\nInez Stepman is a senior policy analyst at Independent Women's Forum (iwf.org) and the host of High Noon podcast.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In a January 2021 poll taken just before Trump left office and days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, 55% considered his time as president a failure.\n\n61% say Biden's presidency thus far has been a failure, while 39% say it's been a success. That's narrowly worse than the 57% who called the first year of his administration a failure in January 2022, with 41% calling it a success.\n\nRepublicans now are more unified around the idea that Trump's presidency was a success than Democrats are that Biden's has been one. Overall, 92% of Republicans call Trump's time in office a success, while just 73% of Democrats say Biden's has been a success so far. Among independents, 51% say Trump's presidency was successful, while only 37% see Biden's as a success.\n\n45% approve of Biden's handling of health care policy and 44% approve of his handling of student loan debt.\n\nBiden's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and a majority disapproval among Democrats (53%).\n\nA broad majority of all Americans, 70%, say economic conditions in the US are poor, with many, particularly Republicans, who feel that way saying their views would be more affected by a political shift than a change in the economy itself.\n\nAmong all voters, when independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein are included in the matchup, Trump holds 42% to Biden's 33%, with Kennedy at 16%, West at 4% and Stein at 3%.

Public opinion in the framing of this term is usually based on the idea of writer, academics, media and intellectuals from the West who belong to a small group of people with power, authority and at times, wealth.\n\nOn many occasions when the phrase international community is used, there is a particular group that wants to get a certain position agreed on, a consensus or accord, on a 'global' issue to give it relevance and show how 'serious' the matter is.\n\nWithout being stated explicitly, the \"international community\" appears to be made up of North America (the United States and Canada), (Western) Europe, a few other nations that are unavoidable due to their strength or membership in the UN Security Council.\n\nAlso, countries with the appropriate historical, cultural, or, more specifically, racial background like Australia, Israel and New Zealand are also famed as members of this community. Despite representations as the \"international community\", when these countries deliberate, it has not always reflected that their agenda is legitimate. Or that the views of their countries' leaders do mirror the aspirations of their people, in a democratic fashion.\n\nThus, the \"international community\" worked heavily against Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2020, to give a tag to the African country as being an isolated, pariah, rogue or failed state by instigating illegal regime change activities.\n\nThe \"other community\", however, dismissed the consensus and public opinion that the so-called international community sought to establish against Zimbabwe.\n\nBased on their international alliance, this community stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" against Zimbabwe by creating narratives that promoted instability within Zimbabwe's borders. During this time, it was China, Cuba, Iran, Russia and South Africa, among others, which stood firm with Zimbabwe.\n\nThis process has been implemented by the \"international community\" against China and Russia, but have failed because the two countries, plus the US, are the only three great powers the world has, hence difficult to sideline.\n\nLikewise, there are strategic reasons why the \"international community\" is now keen on getting a consensus against Iran. These are the nations linked by a particular form of Eurocentrism, if not outright racism, that can also be interpreted as ethno-tribalism.\n\nWestern media, which carries traditional hostility Iran, has in the past few weeks trying to enrage the world against Iran as a policy of \"Persian hatred\" that was started by former US president Donald Trump.\n\nThe hatred has been thick such that the USA has always wanted an opportunity to \"obliterate Iran\". This ought to be seen in the context that the US-led \"international community\" which has repeatedly used the threat of nuclear weapons against Iran.\n\nAt last year's 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a dark warning to Tehran, threatening the country with a nuclear attack.\n\n\"Above all, Iran must face a credible nuclear threat,\" said Netanyahu.\n\nThis nuclear threat that the Israeli authorities later retracted saying Netanyahu had misspoken, is now viewed as war policy along the grain of this long anti-Iran history. Like President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly advocated for the \"obliteration of Iran\", which essentially means use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nFor instance, in May 2019, President Trump wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that \"if Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran\".\n\nIn other posts, President Trump said that the United States would attack Iran with \"great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration\". These threats are genocidal in nature.\n\nBecause of these constant genocidal threats towards Iran, it becomes evident that other great powers take notice, hence China and Russia have and had no alternative but to move towards Iran as moral towers to diffuse the likely propensity by the \"international community\" bloc to use nuclear weapons. They have used nuclear weapons before. This is also important to ensure that Iran is not \"isolated\" because it is a regional power in south-west Asia to build a new alliance of strategic cooperation.\n\nIn Chinese and Russian official media outlets, Iran's support has been formalised and given out with certainty. Against Iran, China has condemned the use of the US' \"long-arm jurisdiction\".\n\nThe long-arm jurisdiction treacherously permits the United States to contend that it has the authority to bring legal action against other nations based on domestic legislation rather than international law.\n\nThis US conceit has been so since the collapse of the USSR, a set of states including Zimbabwe and Iran, have faced the brunt of US force being called rogue states, pariah states, failed states and even labelled state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nTo try and separate China and Russia from Iran, key facts that need to be kept in mind include that the US imposed economic pressure on China leading to a trade war. Secondly, the US also deliberately destroyed relations with Russia, sanctioning the country and expanding NATO eastwards and threatening Russia's security leading to a special military operation in Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, the US' waging of economic warfare against Iran through sanctions heavily impacts China and other countries that will have difficulties to purchase Iran's oil and to continue normal trade.\n\nSuch pressures have brought convergence to China, Iran and Russia in their resoluteness to defend the rest of the world against a racially skewed \"international community\" that only favours the US-led narratives that are detrimental to the interests of others.\n\nThis triad attraction and convergence is cementing as a reaction to the pressure from the West. US behaviour has initiated the speed at which this convergence has been made to enable increased future ties.\n\nIt should be therefore known that the \"international community\" is nothing but a bloc driven by westomania. This is among other reasons why the China-Iran-Russia triad is converging because if any of the three countries falter, the \"other community\" will also falter.", "source": {"uri": "herald.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zimbabwe Herald Online"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/Israels-Prime-Minister-Bi-007.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9520856", "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 452043883, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bc1"}

What made this transaction even more intriguing was the fact that it took place over dark pools, adding an extra layer of opacity to an already enigmatic event.\n\nThe Dark Pool Dilemma\n\nDark pools, often dubbed as the \"shadowy corners\" of the stock market, allow institutional investors to execute large trades away from the prying eyes of the public exchanges. While they offer anonymity and reduced market impact for these large transactions, they also raise concerns about transparency and fairness in the market.\n\nThe $9 million dark pool trade involving DJT stock sent shockwaves through the investment community, sparking debates about the implications of such transactions on market dynamics and investor sentiment.\n\nIn the aftermath of the $9 million dark pool trade, DJT found itself facing a wave of inquiries and concerns from its shareholders. In response, the company issued a letter to shareholders, outlining steps they could take to safeguard their investments and prevent their shares from being used by institutional investors to short the stock.\n\nThe letter provided detailed instructions on how shareholders could opt to hold their stock in a Cash account instead of a Margin account. By doing so, shareholders could limit the ability of institutional investors to borrow their shares for short selling purposes, thereby potentially mitigating downward pressure on the stock price.\n\nFurthermore, the letter advised shareholders against using their brokerage accounts for transactions and instead encouraged them to purchase shares directly from the company. This direct purchase approach not only bypasses the involvement of institutional investors but also strengthens the connection between the company and its shareholders.\n\nWhy Dark Pool Trades are Made By Institutional Investors\n\nDark pool trades are often utilized by institutional investors for several strategic reasons. Primarily, these off-exchange trading venues allow for large blocks of securities to be bought or sold without the details of the trade being publicly disclosed until after the transaction is completed. This helps to minimize market impact. When large volumes of shares are traded on public exchanges, it can significantly sway the price of the stock due to the supply and demand dynamics. By using dark pools, institutional investors can avoid tipping off the market about their intentions, helping to secure a more favorable price and reduce price volatility caused by their large orders.\n\nAdditionally, dark pools offer anonymity, which is particularly appealing to institutions that wish to conceal their trading strategies from competitors. This secrecy is crucial in maintaining a competitive edge in the markets. Institutional investors also benefit from potentially lower transaction costs in dark pools compared to public exchanges, making them a cost-effective trading mechanism.\n\nOverall, dark pools provide institutional investors with a means to manage their large orders more discreetly and efficiently, aligning with their need for privacy, reduced market impact, and cost efficiency in their trading activities.\n\nNavigating the Complexities of the Market\n\nThe $9 million dark pool trade involving DJT stock serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and intricacies of the modern financial markets. While dark pools offer benefits such as liquidity and anonymity for institutional investors, they also raise questions about market transparency and integrity.\n\nAs the dust settles from the aftermath of the $9 million dark pool trade, the investment community remains vigilant, keeping a close eye on developments surrounding DJT stock and similar high-profile companies. While dark pools may continue to cast a shadow over the market, investors can take proactive steps to safeguard their interests and advocate for greater transparency and accountability in the financial system.", "source": {"uri": "guerillastocktrading.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guerilla Stock Trading"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lance_jepsen@guerillastocktrading.com", "name": "Lance Jepsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.guerillastocktrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DJT-stock-dark-pool-trade.png", "eventUri": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 452043846, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bc2"}

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Riyadh comes nearly seven months after the eruption of war in Gaza put the brakes on what was intended as a signature foreign policy achievement for his boss, US President Joe Biden.\n\nIt also comes as Americans prepare to vote in November on whether to give the 81-year-old Biden a second term, an election process that could scramble what progress has been made on Saudi-Zionist normalization so far. In September, before Hamas' Oct 7 attack on the Zionist entity, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Fox News that \"every day we get closer\" to a deal that could also bolster the Washington-Riyadh security partnership.\n\nHowever Prince Mohammed also said the Palestinian issue was \"very important\" for Riyadh, adding: \"We need to ease the life of the Palestinians.\" As fighting drags on and mediators struggle to lock in a truce, Saudi officials have reiterated their insistence on recognition of an independent Palestinian state. Princess Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, told the World Economic Forum in January that normalization would be impossible without an \"irrevocable\" pathway towards that state's creation.\n\nWhile it is no surprise Saudi Arabia would link ties with the Zionist entity to a resolution of the Zionist-Palestinian conflict, \"the price for normalization, especially on the Palestinian front, has certainly gone up,\" said Saudi analyst Aziz Alghashian. \"What can be said is that there needs to be something more tangible than theoretical,\" he said. \"In other words, more irreversible steps that are clear-cut, rather than just promises.\" The US State Department said that Blinken will discuss \"a pathway to an independent Palestinian state with security guarantees for (the Zionist entity)\", during talks in Riyadh on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nProgress disrupted\n\nSaudi Arabia, home to Islam's holiest sites, has never recognized the Zionist entity and did not join the 2020 US-brokered Abraham Accords that saw its Gulf neighbors Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco, establish formal ties with the Zionist entity. After Biden visited the Saudi city of Jeddah and fist-bumped the crown prince in 2022, his administration actively pursued a Saudi-Zionist deal that would build on the Abraham Accords, a foreign policy win for his predecessor Donald Trump.\n\nThe Saudis indicated they would want more than their Gulf peers got, bargaining hard for benefits like US security guarantees and assistance with a civilian nuclear program with uranium enrichment capacity. In the months that followed, Zionist and American officials issued bullish statements, while the Saudis said characteristically little. Their leverage, strengthened by their status as perceived leaders in the Muslim world, was never in doubt, said Elham Fakhro of the Chatham House think-tank.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia is aware of how badly the Biden administration wants a deal,\" Fakhro said. \"It is also aware that no other Arab country holds as much leverage as it does in lobbying for the Palestinians.\" Any momentum stalled abruptly with Hamas' Oct 7 attack. The Zionist entity's military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed more than 34,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Riyadh has consistently denounced Zionist forces' conduct in Gaza, accusing them of \"unchecked heinous war crimes\" just this week.\n\nA tall order\n\nEven without the Gaza war, sealing the Saudi-Zionist-US deal would be a tall order. \"The US will have to deliver on something and none of Saudi Arabia's conditions (or requests) are easy,\" Fakhro said. \"A defense pact would have to go through Congress and its approval there is far from certain.\" The rancor of election season in the US makes bipartisan deal-making even more difficult.\n\nIn any case, Netanyahu has repeatedly made clear his opposition to a Palestinian state, saying last month that Zionists rejected any attempt to \"ram\" it \"down our throats\". Given Saudi Arabia's position, that means an imminent breakthrough is unlikely. Long-time observers of Saudi diplomacy stress that should come as no surprise, despite the recent flurry of meetings and statements.\n\n\"From the beginning, Saudi Arabia was clear: Addressing the Palestinian-(Zionist) conflict in a manner that satisfies the Palestinians is a precondition for normalization with (the Zionist entity),\" said Saudi analyst Hesham Alghannam. \"Saudi Arabia is genuine in its condition that normalization is linked to the end of (the Zionist entity's) occupation of Palestinian land.\" - AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@kuwaittimes.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/04/28/102453.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9525081", "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 452043837, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bc3"}

Six months on from the October 7 attacks, and with the Israeli scorched-earth response ongoing, it seemed timely to talk again to Loewenstein.\n\nHis thesis is that repressive states crave the battle-proven defence and surveillance technology Israel has deployed in Gaza.\n\n\"On the face of it, October 7 shows Israel's multi-billion-dollar intelligence military apparatus failed,\" he says. \"Israel was caught asleep at the wheel, the military disappeared for hours, the wall, the surveillance, all disappeared or was knocked out by Hamas very effectively.\n\n\"You would think that would diminish the image of Israel as a technical marvel. I would argue that in fact the opposite is happening.\"\n\nAgainst the background of entire suburbs being flattened by Israeli munitions, and seemingly every movement of Palestinians - would-be guerrillas and civilians alike - tracked by drones and sensors, personal direct text messages being monitored and the exploration and destruction of the Hamas tunnel network, Israeli defence companies have continued to exhibit at major arms shows and sell their technology.\n\n\"Israel has spent the past six months testing and showing huge amounts of new weapons: drones, quadcopters, surveillance tech and various other equipment in Gaza,\" says Loewenstein. \"It's too early to know exactly who's buying that equipment. We do know, in the past six months, for example, that Israel has had a large presence at arms fairs.\"\n\nStocks soar\n\nAlthough some technology failed on October 7, the incursion was mostly seen as a governmental and intelligence failure to which the answer might be more gear.\n\n\"The companies that have deployed the technology and other surveillance tech on the border that failed haven't taken a step back. If anything, they've simply, very clinically, said, 'Let's not look at the past. Let's focus on the fact that we are now the saviours of Israel.' In other words, 'You need us to protect Israel.\"'\n\nThe main publicly listed Israeli defence companies - IAI, Elbit, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems - have done record business since the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago and their stock prices have generally performed strongly this year.\n\nGlobal interest\n\nLife for Loewenstein has become more intense, as it has for many Jews in the diaspora, as well as in Israel. His book was somehow even more relevant and people worldwide wanted to know more about the failure of Israeli intelligence represented by the October 7 massacre and the implications of the devastating response.\n\n\"It's been very, very difficult. My book came out before October 7 and was doing pretty well. I got a lot of attention. Then October 7 happened and it's just exploded in ways that I could never have imagined. I wake up every day to interview requests from every corner of the globe.\"\n\nThe Sydney-based Loewenstein was already no stranger to attacks from fellow Jews and come-what-may backers of Israel. His journalism has been highly critical of the Israeli state and what he sees as decades of repression of Palestinians. His 2007 book, My Israel Question, was a searing indictment of Zionism and his rejection of it as a Jew.\n\nHe says Israel is profiting financially and in regional and global influence by demonstrating its military effectiveness and the depth of its monitoring capabilities. Far from failing on October 7 - a failing that may land on the military and not its equipment - Israel is exploiting the power of its weaponry deployed in Gaza.\n\nArab states that signed the so-called Abraham Accords (United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco) to normalise relations with Israel under the Trump administration have stuck with the relationship, as has Saudi Arabia, which had been close to establishing normal relations before October 7.\n\nIn each case, the authoritarian regimes may pay lip service to suppressed domestic protests against the Israeli destruction of Gaza, but in the end, Loewenstein believes, their political elites want access to Israel and its technology.\n\n\"None of them have cut ties and none of them will. I'm talking about the Saudis, the Emiratis, the Bahrainis, the list goes on. They know their people, in general, are very against what Israel is doing. And, to some extent, they have to show deference to that anger.\n\n\"But ultimately, I would argue that these nations are increasingly fearful of their own people for a range of reasons of which Palestine is one among many. They feel like they need the most sophisticated, repressive technology that they're buying from Israel to control their own people.\"\n\nLoewenstein expresses gloom about the outlook for Palestinians and for Israel, a country he sees as in the grip of a right wing that dehumanises Palestinians. Israel, he says, has no intention of bowing to what he sees as illusory and performative demands for a two-state solution - one which all who talk about it cynically know will never happen.\n\nIsrael radicalised\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be personally unpopular, but his policies and the right-wing elements in his coalition are popular, especially after October 7. Loewenstein says Israel is increasingly on a course that assumes Israeli ethnic superiority. Its uncompromising stance combines with extreme ideas of the end of days on the religious right to create sometimes odd bedfellows on the hard right of populist politics worldwide, especially given the history of the Holocaust.\n\n\"There is a major constituency in Israel for an ongoing war for endless occupation. Israeli society has been radicalised very strongly for years. October 7 has certainly made that even stronger.\"\n\nThe hideous bragging videos of atrocities and the dehumanisation of Palestinians posted by Israeli soldiers involve \"not just a few bad apples,\" he says. \"No. A massive amount of Israeli soldiers in cars are filming themselves on TikTok dehumanising Palestinians and this is not a handful of soldiers. This is ubiquitous.\"\n\nDuring our Zoom conversation, Loewenstein made a striking observation that put the scale of the destruction in Gaza into a historical context - one which should have been obvious but was somehow lost in the immediacy of the conflict: this war has displaced hundreds of thousands more people than the expulsion (or withdrawal, depending on who is telling the story) of Palestinians in 1948. The UN estimates 1.7 million people have been displaced in Gaza. In 1948, about 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled the region.\n\nKnown to Palestinians as the Nakba or Catastrophe, it is the origin of the occupation of the West Bank, the creation of an isolated Gaza Strip, and the status of Palestinians as refugees in camps created in that era, many of which are still there 75 years later. It's a scary calculus when you think how long the effects of the war against Hamas may last. \"What's happening now is on a scale far bigger than 1948. There's more displacement. And the killing was not even close to where we are now,\" he says of the more than 33,000 people reported killed in Gaza.\n\n\"We all know that this is going to take literally decades to rebuild.\"\n\nHe expects a generational explosion of anti-Israel and anti-Western sentiment across the Arab world.\n\nSlow dawning\n\nWith most domestic media in Israel reporting a strongly Israeli perspective on the conflict, and with social media tending to channel discussion into pre-existing camps, Loewenstein sees no sign that the Israeli public recognise the scale of the Gaza crisis or the likelihood they will live with its consequences for decades to come.\n\nNetanyahu may be the bogeyman, but he represents, or is in cahoots with, a large and robust portion of Israelis and certainly of Israeli hard-right politicians. He continues to face corruption charges, but he may well be replaced by someone just as hardline. Settlers continue to expand territory in the West Bank and even propose going to Gaza.\n\n\"It's fair to say that it's hard not to be even more despairing now than I would have been when we spoke [last July],\" Loewenstein says. \"Things are so grim. The only silver lining, in a way, is that there are growing numbers of young Jews who have been at the forefront of opposition to what's going on, mostly in the US, UK, Jewish Voice for Peace [for example]. They're a minority, but they're a growing minority.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "its@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "its", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tech@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "tech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/QR262UV6TZEEJCGA7CGIADA27E.jpg?auth=680a535794b5c19f590d567f5dca29d9a862b8e9a2a225abbac2cbeaf78ce3fd&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "eventUri": "eng-9515473", "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 452043809, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bc4"}

And in the coming rematch, opinions about the first term of each man vying for a second four years in the White House now appear to work in Trump's favor, with most Americans saying that, looking back, Trump's term as president was a success, while a broad majority says Biden's has so far been a failure.\n\nTrump's support in the poll among registered voters holds steady at 49% in a head-to-head matchup against Biden, the same as in CNN's last national poll on the race in January, while Biden's stands at 43%, not significantly different from January's 45%.\n\nLooking back, 55% of all Americans now say they see Trump's presidency as a success, while 44% see it as a failure. In a January 2021 poll taken just before Trump left office and days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, 55% considered his time as president a failure.\n\nAssessing Biden's time in office so far, 61% say his presidency thus far has been a failure, while 39% say it's been a success. That's narrowly worse than the 57% who called the first year of his administration a failure in January 2022, with 41% calling it a success. Republicans now are more unified around the idea that Trump's presidency was a success than Democrats are that Biden's has been one. Overall, 92% of Republicans call Trump's time in office a success, while just 73% of Democrats say Biden's has been a success so far. Among independents, 51% say Trump's presidency was successful, while only 37% see Biden's as a success. There is some overlap in views of the two most recent presidents' achievements, with 14% of Americans saying they consider both are failures, while 8% say both are successes. About half of registered voters, 47%, consider Biden's presidency thus far to be a failure while saying Trump's was a success, while only 30% say Biden's has been successful and that Trump's was not.

Even Biden's strongest issue approval ratings in the poll are also in negative territory, with 45% approving of his handling of health care policy and 44% approving his handling of student loan debt.

It is Joe Biden who has discarded the Constitution and imposed a blizzard of illegal or probably-illegal regulations on the rest of us.\n\nLately, they have been coming so furiously that it is hard to keep up with them. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board caught up with just one set, relating to power plants. The intent of the regulations is to set our economy and our material well-being back by as much as a century:\n\nOn Thursday the Environmental Protection Agency proposed its latest doozy -- rules that will effectively force coal plants to shut down while banning new natural-gas plants.\n\n***\n\nBarack Obama's regulation spurred a wave of coal plant closures. Now President Biden is trying to finish the job by tightening mercury, wastewater and ash disposal standards. EPA is also replacing the Obama Clean Power Plan that the Supreme Court struck down with a rule requiring that coal plants and new gas-fired plants adopt costly and unproven carbon-capture technology by 2032.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that Obama's Clean Power Plan was illegal; Biden's version likely will meet the same fate. But the damage done in the meantime will be incalculable.\n\nSection 111 of the Clean Air Act says the EPA can regulate pollutants from stationary sources through the \"best system of emission reduction\" that is \"adequately demonstrated.\" Carbon capture is neither the best nor adequately demonstrated. As of last year, only one commercial-scale coal plant in the world used carbon capture, and no gas-fired plants did.\n\nExisting carbon capture technology will badly degrade our ability to produce electricity:\n\nBecause carbon capture uses 20% to 25% of the electricity generated by a power plant, less will be available to the grid. That means more generators will be needed to provide the same amount of power. But new gas-fired plants won't be built because the technology will make them uneconomic. Talk about a catch-22.\n\nAnother problem: CO2 must be stored underground in certain geologic formations, largely in the upper Midwest and Gulf Coast. Permitting new wells for CO2 injections can take six years. Pipelines to transport CO2 can take even longer. Green groups oppose pipelines for CO2 as they do for oil and natural gas.\n\nAll of this regulatory uncertainty will discourage the development of new gas-fired plants even as coal plants that currently generate about 16% of the country's power are forced to retire.\n\nSo the federal government is forcing us to produce less electricity. Meanwhile, the demand for electricity is growing:\n\nAll of this will hit while demand for power is surging amid new manufacturing needs and an artificial intelligence boom. Texas's grid operator this week raised its forecast for demand growth for 2030 by 40,000 megawatts compared to last year's forecast. That's about seven times the power that New York City uses at any given time.\n\nTexas power demand will nearly double over the next six years owing to data centers, manufacturing plants, crypto mining and the electrification of oil and gas equipment.\n\nWe are on a collision course with disaster. And to what end? These new rules will do no good whatsoever, except for those who are on the Democratic Party's \"green\" gravy train. They will get many billions of dollars, if not trillions, at the American people's expense.\n\nBy the way, EPA plans to unveil soon another rule to reduce CO2 emissions from existing gas-fired plants, so some of them may also have to shut down. Meantime, China has added about 200 gigawatts of coal power over the last five years -- about as much as the entire U.S. coal fleet. The Biden fossil-fuel onslaught will have no effect on global temperatures.\n\nBiden's purpose is not to benefit the climate, it is to benefit the vast \"green\" grift that is one of the Democratic Party's main constituencies. The greens, but also Communist China. China controls the market for solar panels and wind turbines, and it also controls the raw materials that are necessary to produce solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and the hypothetical batteries that are the magical solution to the fact that weather-dependent sources of energy can never fuel an economy-a primitive economy, let alone a modern one.\n\nWhy is Biden destroying our electrical grid and dragging the United States back into the 19th century, to the immense benefit of the Chinese Communist Party? Occam's Razor suggests that he is doing it on purpose. Even Joe Biden isn't dumb enough to fail to understand where these policies are leading. I don't know whether it is sheer, malicious anti-Americanism, or whether the millions of dollars that Biden and his family have gotten from China have made him the Manchurian Candidate. But, one way or another, the disastrous consequences of the Biden administration's energy policies are obvious to anyone who pays attention.", "source": {"uri": "powerlineblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Power Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_hinderaker@powerlineblog.com", "name": "John Hinderaker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "image": "https://www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2024/04/oxen57.jpg?w=640", "eventUri": "eng-9511625", "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 452043680, "relevance": 1, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bc7"}

Pressure is building on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal that would free some Israeli hostages and bring a cease-fire in the war in Gaza. The White House says Biden reiterated his \"clear position\" as Israel plans to invade Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah despite global concern for more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering there. The U.S. opposes the invasion on humanitarian grounds. Israel is among the countries U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit as he returns to the Middle East on Monday.\n\nArrests roil campuses nationwide ahead of graduation as protesters demand Israel ties be cut\n\nProtests against the war in Gaza are roiling college campuses nationwide. That means schools with graduation ceremonies next month are facing the possibility of protests colliding with commencements. Students are demanding the schools cut financial ties with Israel and hundreds of students have been arrested on campuses from coast to coast. Protesters on both sides of the issue shouted and shoved each other during demonstrations Sunday at the University of California, Los Angeles. About 275 people were arrested on Saturday at campuses including Indiana University at Bloomington, Arizona State University and Washington University in St. Louis. Those have pushed the number of arrests nationwide to nearly 900 since April 18.\n\nHave you heard the one about Trump? Biden tries humor on the campaign trail\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is out to win some votes by scoring some laughs at the expense of Donald Trump. Biden is using mockery with the goal of getting under Trump's skin and reminding the country of Trump's blunders. Like a comic honing his routine, the Democratic president has been testing and expanding his jokes over the past few weeks. It started with jabs about his Republican opponent's financial problems, and now Biden regularly jeers Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and much more. The jokes are the latest attempt to crack the code on how to clap back at Trump, whose own schtick has redrawn the boundaries of what's acceptable in modern politics.\n\nDonald Trump is running against Joe Biden. But he keeps bringing up another Democrat: Jimmy Carter\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Donald Trump is running against Joe Biden, but Trump keeps bringing up another Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Trump likes to cite the 99-year-old Carter as a measuring stick to belittle Biden. Trump calls Carter a happy man because, according to Trump, Biden's performance in office makes Carter's presidency look good in comparison. It was once common for Republicans to mock Carter, who lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan in 1980 amid inflation, energy shortages and the Iran hostage crisis. Trump's implication is that Biden's economy makes Carter's look better. Federal figures show today's economy is stronger and more stable than in the late 1970s. And over the years, Carter's overall presidency has gotten stronger assessments from historians.\n\nTornadoes kill 4 in Oklahoma, leaving trail of destruction and thousands without power\n\nSULPHUR, Okla. (AP) -- Tornadoes have killed four people in Oklahoma and left thousands without power. The tornadoes began late Saturday night and left at least 100 people injured around Oklahoma. One tornado destroyed several downtown buildings in Sulphur, Oklahoma, flipping over cars and shearing rooftops off houses across a 15-block radius. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt toured the destruction on Sunday and said every business in the town of Sulphur appeared to have been destroyed. Oklahoma's severe weather adds to the dozens of reported tornadoes that have wreaked havoc in the nation's midsection since Friday. Authorities said Sunday that one person also died in Iowa because of the storms.\n\nPutin likely didn't order death of Russian opposition leader Navalny, US official says\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Russian President Vladimir Putin likely didn't order the death of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny in February. An official says the U.S. intelligence community has found \"no smoking gun\" that Putin was aware of the timing of Navalny's death or directly ordered it. The official says it's believed Putin was ultimately responsible for the death of Navalny, who endured brutal conditions during his confinement. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. Navalny was Russia's best-known opposition politician and died while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he called politically motivated. A month later, Putin won reelection.\n\nPassage of harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law in Iraq draws diplomatic backlash\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) -- Human rights groups and diplomat have criticized a law that was quietly passed by the Iraqi parliament over the weekend that would impose heavy prison sentences on gay and transgender people. Although homosexuality is taboo in the largely conservative Iraqi society and political leaders have periodically launched anti-LGBTQ campaigns, Iraq did not previously have a law that explicitly criminalized it. The law passed Saturday with little notice as an amendment to the country's existing anti-prostitution law, imposes a sentence of 10 to 15 years for same-sex relations and a prison term of one to three years for people who undergo or perform gender-transition surgeries and for \"intentional practice of effeminacy.\"\n\nAfrican farmers look to the past and the future to address climate change\n\nHARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- From ancient fertilizer methods in Zimbabwe to new greenhouse technology in Somalia, farmers across the heavily agriculture-reliant African continent are looking both to the past and future to respond to climate change. Africa has the world's youngest population. It is seeing the worst effects of a warming planet while contributing the least to the problem. Farmers are scrambling to make sure the booming population is fed. Some are turning to traditional foods that had been long dismissed as weeds or neglected in favor of imports. Others embrace new planting methods and varieties. One new bean's side benefit is less flatulence.\n\nObstacles remain as women seek more leadership roles in America's Black Church\n\nThroughout its long history, the Black Church in America has - for the most part - been a patriarchal institution, with men making up the vast majority of its ranks of clergy. These days, increasing numbers of Black women are attending seminary, and some women are carving out high-profile leadership roles. The African Methodist Episcopal Church says it has more than 1,000 female pastors. But obstacles remain. The founder of a group called Women of Color in Ministry estimates that less than one in 10 Black Protestant congregations are led by a woman.\n\nCandace Parker, a 3-time WNBA champion and 2-time Olympic gold medalist, announces retirement\n\nThree-time WNBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Candace Parker has announced she's retiring after 16 seasons.

Parker became the first player in WNBA history to be named Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in the same season in 2008.

Nic Antaya/Washington Post\n\nDEARBORN, Mich. - Abdullah Hammoud had been outspoken about Israel's assault in Gaza and President Biden's unconditional support of Israel for nearly four months, but he had not attracted much attention outside his native Dearborn. That all changed in late January, when he made a decision that would catapult him from little-known mayor to national figure.\n\nBiden's campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, was coming to town, a fellow Arab American official told Hammoud. How would the Dearborn mayor feel about meeting with her?\n\nSomething didn't sit right with Hammoud.\n\nIsrael's military campaign in Gaza had killed more than 25,000 Palestinians. Hammoud had heard from residents of this majority Arab American city who had lost 20, 40, even 80, relatives. The war was spreading to southern Lebanon and Yemen, where many of Dearborn's residents had ancestral roots. This was the first outreach he had received from anyone in the Biden camp and it was not a White House official with the ability to influence policy, but someone whose sole job was getting the president reelected.\n\nHammoud, a Democratic mayor of a city of just over 100,000 residents, made a decision that sent an unmistakable message: He turned down the meeting.\n\n\"That was a concept people couldn't understand: 'Why would you do that?'\" Hammoud said in a recent interview while driving around Dearborn. \"Immediately when I got the invitation, I felt like it was a disingenuous engagement. It was an engagement only for the worry of what's going to happen in the upcoming election, and not for the worry of what's actually happening to the people on the ground and to their friends and family and my residents.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Hammoud, the first Arab American and Muslim mayor of Dearborn, has had to navigate myriad crosscurrents. He has spoken with White House officials - though not campaign operatives - who have looked to him to try to understand his constituents' anger at the president, and what it might take to win them back. He has become a prominent voice for Arab American and Muslim voters, not just in Dearborn but across the country, who say that Biden has betrayed and dehumanized them.\n\nAnd still, the 34-year-old Hammoud has to keep his attention on the job he was elected to do: overseeing the city of Dearborn. He now spends hours discussing foreign policy and the political fallout of Biden's support of Israel. But his days are filled with meetings about budgets, flooding, community parks and city events.\n\n\"I ran for office on the idea that I'd ensure your garbage was picked up on time,\" Hammoud said. He has received numerous invitations for dinners and speaking engagements related to the war, but he has turned most of them down. \"It's humbling,\" he said. \"But I try to tell folks I'm still the mayor of Dearborn, and this is my primary focus.\"\n\nAfter rejecting the meeting with Chavez Rodriguez, Hammoud made clear that he would only meet with policymakers, not campaign operatives. Two weeks later, the White House sent a high-level delegation to Dearborn that included Jon Finer, Biden's deputy national security adviser, and Samantha Power, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nThe Israel-Gaza war is, on its face, a foreign policy issue thousands of miles away from a midsize city in Michigan. But it occupies a unique space in Dearborn, where it has in essence become a local issue, now consuming the community for more than six months. The city is a little more than 50 percent Arab American and sits in a swing state that is crucial to Biden's path to a second term.\n\nResidents have organized dozens of protests and fundraisers since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants rampaged through the Israel-Gaza border fence and killed 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 253 others hostage into Gaza, according to Israeli authorities. In response, Israel launched a punishing military assault that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, the majority of whom are women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's siege of the enclave has also created a humanitarian catastrophe as Gaza's health system has collapsed and its residents face famine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichigan is home to the nation's largest Arab American and Muslim population, with about 300,000 people who claim ancestry from the Middle East or North Africa, and that community overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020. Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes in 2020 and is expected to face another tight contest this year against former president Donald Trump.\n\nAlong the way, Dearborn has become the informal headquarters of a movement among progressives to withhold their votes from Biden in November. Activists in the city helped organize a campaign urging voters to choose \"uncommitted\" in the Michigan Democratic primary in February, an effort that garnered more than 100,000 votes and spread to other swing states. Those election protests have now been joined by demonstrations at numerous college campuses across the country.\n\nAgainst that highly charged backdrop, Hammoud faces furiously competing pressures. Many Arab Americans and Muslims view meetings with Biden or his top aides as pointless or even a betrayal. And many Democrats, while sympathetic to the community's anger, believe Hammoud has a responsibility to help convince his constituents - as well as Arab Americans and Muslims across the country - to vote for Biden and prevent a second Trump term.\n\n\"I think he's probably the most influential person in the state of Michigan when it comes to the Muslim and Arab American community and young progressives,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who met with Hammoud in February. Khanna is a Biden supporter and surrogate who has strong ties to the Democratic Party's progressive and minority factions.\n\nIf Hammoud does not support Biden, \"I'd be disappointed, because I want the president to win and I think that would make his path more challenging, especially in Michigan,\" Khanna added. \"But I understand this is a matter of conscience for Abdullah and he's true to the community he represents.\"\n\nHammoud has not yet decided whether he will vote for Biden. But he gets asked that nearly every day, and he knows he can only postpone the decision for so long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The whole community wants to know, how do we all march together in one direction? ... How do we demonstrate our power come November, and what are the trade-offs?\" he said. \"Because we also understand that a losing Biden is a winning Trump.\"\n\nKhalid Turaani, co-chair of Michigan's \"Abandon Biden\" campaign, commended Hammoud for deftly navigating these political crosscurrents. But he said he is worried the mayor may ultimately feel pressured to support Biden as a fellow Democrat, which Turaani said would be a \"betrayal.\"\n\n\"It would be a huge disservice to our community, because our community is not going to matter if we don't stand our ground,\" Turaani said.\n\n'No reason for me to be there'\n\nEven before he rose to national prominence, Hammoud wrestled with how to interact with the White House.\n\nHe visited Washington in mid-January, about a week before he turned down the session with Biden's campaign manager, for a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. When Biden hosted the group at the White House, Hammoud skipped the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I did not feel that at this point in time, the administration would be welcoming to a Muslim Arab American. The White House didn't feel like it represented me,\" Hammoud said in an interview in January. \"So I felt like there was no reason for me to be there.\"\n\nMayors of large, prominent cities like New York and Los Angeles often have national profiles. But it is rare for a mayor of a small or midsize city to gain that kind of recognition, let alone for a foreign policy issue.\n\nHammoud did not dream of political life. Born to Lebanese immigrants in Dearborn, he grew up the second of five children in a poor family. His mother dropped out of high school at age 17 after she got married and then pregnant, and his father spent most of Hammoud's childhood as a truck driver delivering steel for auto companies.\n\nHammoud was 12 or 13 when he truly realized his family was poor. A stranger called asking for their address and Hammoud innocently gave it to him, even as his father was bellowing at him from the other room to hang up. A few days later, collections agents showed up at the house.\n\nHammoud initially dreamed of medical school as a path to financial stability, but after he failed to get in, he shifted to public health, and by age 25, he was being interviewed for six-figure jobs at health firms.\n\nThen his life took an unexpected turn. On Oct. 15, 2015, Hammoud's older brother, Ali, who suffered from seizures, called him at 5:29 a.m., saying something felt wrong. Hammoud called an ambulance and ran to his brother's home. Ali went into a seizure, and Hammoud knew before they left the house that his brother, then 27, was dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHammoud dropped his career plans, deciding he wanted to pursue a more meaningful path, and a few weeks later was approached with an opportunity to run for an open state House seat. His parents were against the idea. Politics had ruined Lebanon; why would their son want to become a part of that?\n\nHammoud's father told him in Arabic: \"Don't forget your name is Abdullah Hammoud.\" He didn't think it was possible for an Arab and Muslim to win elected office in America.\n\nBut Hammoud did win, becoming, at age 26, the first Arab American and Muslim elected to represent Michigan's 15th district. After a couple years, Hammoud felt he could have more impact directly overseeing Dearborn than as one of 110 in the state House. He ultimately beat out five other candidates and assumed the mayor's office in January 2022.\n\nMany of Hammoud's experiences growing up have shaped his policies as mayor. He remembers how he and his siblings could not afford the $5 entrance fee to the local pool; during his first summer as mayor, Hammoud made community pools free for all children 13 and under.\n\nAs someone who focused much of his mayoral campaign on the nuts-and-bolts of the city's flooding problem, Hammoud could have never foreseen his rise to become a leading voice on a foreign war.\n\nHis chief adviser through this unlikely maze is his wife, Fatima. Hammoud consults with her nearly every night on when and how he should speak out, what meetings he should take and how he should approach them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatima is wary of the attention that comes with Hammoud's fame, especially after the Wall Street Journal published an editorial in February titled \"Welcome to Dearborn, America's Jihad Capital.\" The article prompted increased threats to Hammoud and the city, including one person who threatened to behead his 2-year-old and then-4-month-old children. But Fatima believes Hammoud has a unique opportunity to advocate on behalf of his Dearborn community.\n\nDuring a recent evening at home, playing with their kids, the two discussed Hammoud's rise and his potential to swing critical voters. Hammoud expressed discomfort at having that kind of impact.\n\n\"Why do you hope you don't influence the election?\" she asked him. \"I hope you do.\"\n\nA careful balance\n\nOn a Tuesday afternoon in March, Hammoud, who was fasting for Ramadan, held meetings on city business. Abed Ayoub, director of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, a national group, made the case for holding its annual conference in Dearborn instead of Washington - a move he argued would be especially meaningful after the Wall Street Journal column. \"If you want to talk to Arab Americans, you're going to do it in our city,\" Ayoub said. \"What we're basically doing is welcoming all Arab Americans home.\" Hammoud agreed.\n\nThe following afternoon, Hammoud stopped in at one of Dearborn's grocery stores as residents were picking up items for iftar, the meal in which Muslims break their fast during Ramadan. Several of the store's employees warmly greeted Hammoud: one man stocking shelves, another behind the meat counter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHammoud knows he will likely face criticism whether he endorses Biden or ultimately announces he cannot support him. Many Muslims and Arab Americans, as well as progressives and people of color, could be swayed by the mayor's decision, and if Biden loses Michigan - and the White House - as a result, Hammoud fears that Arab Americans and Muslims will be blamed for Trump's triumph. Yet casting a vote for Biden now, after his backing of Israel's military onslaught in Gaza, seems unpalatable to many Arab Americans.\n\nFor now, Hammoud is pursuing a careful balance.\n\nBefore meeting with Finer and Power in February, he pored through six hours worth of interviews the two officials had given since the war started; at various points, he read their quotes back to them. He came in with 10 pages of notes not just on Gaza, but on West Bank settlements, sanctions and other issues.\n\nThe meetings between Biden officials and Hammoud, as well as other leaders in Michigan, showed the White House the depth and political impact of the community's anger, according to a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations.\n\nBiden began shifting his rhetoric, calling Israel's military response in Gaza \"over the top.\" He more directly acknowledged Palestinian suffering, and he told Israel there were \"no excuses\" for not allowing in more aid.\n\nHammoud so far has managed to keep his city, as well as Arab and Muslim communities outside of Dearborn, largely united behind him. He has advocated for his residents, and has sought to convey to the White House the sense of betrayal felt by many Arab Americans and Muslims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHammoud has also distanced himself on occasion from the more hard-hitting rhetoric coming from his community. When video emerged earlier this month of protesters in Dearborn chanting \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to America,\" Hammoud publicly condemned it.\n\n\"The Dearborn community stands for peace and justice for all people,\" Hammoud wrote on X. \"We are proud to call this city and this country home.\"\n\nShortly after the Oct. 7 attacks, Hammoud faced criticism for a statement that condemned the killing of innocents but only after blasting Israel's military occupation of Gaza, saying that \"context\" of the decades-long conflict was crucial to understand the unfolding events.\n\nHammoud said he recognizes Biden's shift in tone toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but insisted the president must do more. \"Is it truly a win to say the president no longer casts doubt on how many Palestinians have been killed? Is that the bar in which we as a community are moving forward?\" Hammoud said.\n\nUntil the Gaza war, Hammoud considered Biden one of the best American presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt. His city has won tens of millions of dollars in grants under Biden's infrastructure law. His residents have benefited from the president's health reforms, including a $35 cap on insulin prices.\n\nBut Hammoud says he cannot look past the tens of thousands killed and wounded in Gaza, the millions displaced, the stream of U.S. weapons flowing to Israel.\n\n\"We want the world to see and recognize that humanity is on the ballot in November,\" Hammoud said. \"My biggest fear is that [Biden] is not going to be remembered as the president who saved democracy in 2020 and all this transformative legislation - he's going to be remembered as the president who sided with Benjamin Netanyahu and chose him over American democracy.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: gaza, Israel, President Biden Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "image": "https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/04/mich-mayor-gaza_IY6YMA4ZQUWZCLWE6TRR4S57JE.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9524819", "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 452043345, "relevance": 2, "_id": "66372d5e90974598fd657bcc"}
